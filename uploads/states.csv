He's seen here in 2018. Donald Page/Getty ImagesIf I wanted a failed football coach as my U.S. senator, I’d move to Alabama.
And I’m not moving to Alabama.
Seriously, what in Derek Dooley’s resume makes him think his next job ought to be serving Georgia in the U.S. Senate? At age 57, his sole asset as a political candidate is his legendary last name, gifted to him by his late father, the longtime football coach and athletic director at the University of Georgia. 
In football, that name opened a lot of doors for the younger Dooley, but once inside those doors he wasn’t able to stay long. His career peaked with a surprise hiring as head coach of the University of Tennessee, where he was fired in 2012 after building the worst record of any Volunteer coach since 1906.
Yet to hear Dooley tell it, mediocrity in other fields might be the perfect qualification for government work. He apparently aspires to be a generic candidate, spouting generic rhetoric, and in that sense at least he is already off to a grand start.
Consider his announcement of interest in the race:
“Georgia deserves stronger common-sense leadership in the U.S. Senate that represents all Georgians and focuses on results — not headlines. I believe our state needs a political outsider in Washington — not another career politician — to cut through the noise and partisanship and get back to real problem solving.”
Excited yet?
In that statement, Dooley refers to himself “a political outsider,” which is one way to put it. Another is to describe his potential candidacy as a political version of stunt casting, where producers put an unqualified celebrity in a role in hopes that name recognition will make up for a lack of actual skill or talent. It shows disrespect for the audience and disrespect for the craft, but sometimes it works, if only for a short period of time.
It worked for Republicans in Alabama, where Coach Tommy Tuberville leveraged a mediocre football career into a seat in the U.S. Senate, and now reigns as the dumbest member of that once illustrious chamber. It didn’t work so well in Pennsylvania, when TV’s Dr. Oz was the candidate. It also didn’t work here in Georgia in 2022, when the GOP ran a far more famous football celebrity, Herschel Walker, as their candidate for U.S. Senate.
As we know, Walker then proceeded to embarrass himself, his party and his state, losing what could have been a winnable race against Raphael Warnock. So, given that recent history, why would Georgia Republicans risk burning their hand again on the same hot stove, this time by considering Dooley? 
Well, there are reasons.
To Republicans, Herschel’s appeal as a candidate went beyond high name recognition. With a friendship with Donald Trump but no history in politics, he could be presented to the public, and more specifically to the GOP base, as a vacant slate, which he pretty much was.
At the time, GOP leaders feared that a highly competitive primary would unleash forces within the base that general-election voters would find disturbing, particularly with candidates competing to outdo each other for Trump’s approval. Walker was their way of side-stepping all that.
In 2025, three years later, that danger hasn’t gone away, and with Trump back in the White House it has intensified. Look at U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter of Savannah. While Dooley dithers about whether to run, Carter has jumped into the Senate race and is campaigning hard for the attention of the one man who matters most.
For example, when Trump says he wants to seize Greenland as American territory, Carter proposes to seize it and rename it “Red, White and Blue Land.” When Trump bombs Iran, Carter wants to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. It’s shameless groveling of the sort that Trump loves, that GOP primary voters love, but many other Georgia voters will not.
But if your name isn’t Dooley, that’s what you have to do to get noticed.

And no one voted for it. No one even told you. But it’s real. It starts right after July 4th.
While most people are grilling and watching fireworks, a quiet but deeply consequential operation will begin. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Connecticut’s DEEP will start injecting diquat dibromide, an herbicide banned in the European Union into public rivers and lakes.
The target? An invasive plant called hydrilla. The truth? This is a chemical shortcut. One that risks ecological collapse, damages native species, and puts public health in the crossfire.

Hydrilla stems grow up from the sediment to the surface of the water. At the water’s surface, stems are highly branched, forming dense mats of vegetation. Stems produce reproductive structures called turions (pictured at red arrow: vegetative buds that can grow into new plants). Credit: Office of Aquatic Invasive Species, Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station
Yes, hydrilla’s a real problem. No one’s denying that. But spraying entire ecosystems with high-collateral poisons is like napalming a neighborhood to kill weeds in one yard. It’s not management. It’s failure.
And if it feels like a sci-fi plot, it is.
This is exactly what happened to Arthur Dent in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Some bureaucrat signed off on demolishing his house to make way for a bypass because “the plans were posted.” Now replace the house with a river. Replace the demolition company with the Army Corps. And replace the bypass with a toxic herbicide treatment that nobody knew was coming. Some pencil pusher woke up and decided our rivers needed purging. He doesn’t live here. He doesn’t swim here. He doesn’t drink from it. But his signature just altered your ecosystem. Colonel Justin R. Pabis signed the final authorization.
Gov. Ned Lamont? He shrugs. “Not our project.” Yet if a private company tried to dump these toxins, you’d have cops and hazmat trucks blocking them within the hour. But because this came with a PDF and a federal logo, it sails through? Where’s the National Guard? If the governor gave a damn, he’d halt this right now and demand public hearings. Because no one gave consent to chemical warfare against a river.
This isn’t how a free people treat public water. This is how a collapsed bureaucracy poisons it. Because no one consented to this. No town hall. No vote. No opt-out.
This isn’t how a free people treat their water. It’s how a collapsed system poisons it.
Diquat dibromide is a bipyridyl herbicide. It kills by oxidizing plant cells on contact.It doesn’t discriminate. It destroys all green tissue it touches. And it sticks in the sediment. It lingers. 
It’s banned in Europe. It’s linked to fish kills. It’s dangerous to humans. But it’s coming to: Chester Creek, Hamburg Cove, Selden Creek, Salmon River, Deep River and Lake Pocotopaug. All of them.


These are public waterways. You use them. Your kids use them. Wildlife depends on them. There is no long-term monitoring plan. There is no consent. Just a quiet federal rollout.
And here’s the kicker: This is a pilot program. If they normalize chemical warfare on Connecticut rivers, this template spreads. To Massachusetts. To Georgia. To New York.To everywhere. 
And you know the reason why? Because its easier to poison us than do the real work to remove the plant. And the real worst part? They are not even that difficult. They make boats designed for this exact purpose. And the worst of all worst parts? They don’t even know if the plant is even that harmful in the first place. Its in their own PDF,  section 4.6 It basically says the plant might be bad, but it might not.
This isn’t management. It’s pure laziness with brute force — a bulldozer. And we don’t need more patches. We need ecological intelligence.
Speak now, before your river is next.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 04:01:40+00:00,CT Mirror,Chronic homelessness –we are the problem,Katherine Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/chronic-homelessness-in-ct-we-are-the-problem/,"We judge the unhoused, we criticize, we don’t want to pay for them, and we don’t want them in our back yard, even if they have been our neighbor all along.","The stigma of poverty is deeply painful for many unhoused citizens throughout Connecticut. It influences decision making, problem solving and the personal safety of more than a thousand individuals across the state. 
Many would rather remain in unsafe conditions to avoid the shame of being found out. In many of these cases, medical emergencies go unaddressed and physical violence becomes more prevalent. Those in the crisis of poverty are often in danger.
For those with mental health diagnoses and/or substance use history, these situations are often chronic. The alternative is emergency shelter. Connecticut offers emergency shelter for those in active addiction. What many may not consider is that those in recovery and those actively using drugs are mingling and developing friendships. In a stressful and unstructured environment like a wet shelter, this creates endless opportunity for failure.
The goal of many (if not all) agencies within the homeless system is to practice effective harm reduction. In my experience, this is often done poorly or not at all. The problem with harm reduction strategy is that it needs to be practiced consistently and without deviation from its designed procedure. Half-assed attempts or alterative practices create the opposite effect. This is a regular occurrence within wet shelters.
As a provider and volunteer in the community, I speak directly with those utilizing recovery resources in New London County and I am well versed in the goings-on of shelter. Temporary residents of shelter often complain about the lack of support, the ‘free-for-all’ use of drugs, theft, violence and complacency of guests setting a tone for their own journey. The phrase ‘doing nothing’ comes up again and again.
Services are not properly tailored to the individual either. The state and federal governments pour millions of dollars into helping the unhoused. Programs are created to support these individuals but when the staff isn’t properly trained or vetted, or if the clients are only given 20% of what they need, problems occur. This is a huge issue and it is commonplace. 
In my experience, shelter guests are often treated like herded cattle. They are hustled into housing when they have little to no support to maintain it. It’s also often done on a whim which is chaotic and awful for the guests. In some instances, people are offered poor or inappropriate housing because it is known this person cannot maintain housing independently. I’ve seen this happen repeatedly. They cycle in and out of shelter over and over and over.
The system creates unrealistic standards as well. A person should be enrolled in and exited from shelter in a very brief amount of time. For example, 45 days or 60 days. This is partly because funding is linked to ‘length of stay.’
Picture this, you’ve been laid off from your job where you were barely making ends meet. As someone with poor computer skills, you struggle to apply for work as most employers use electronic applications. You reach out to your local employment office and schedule an appointment for help – it’s six weeks out. When you arrive at that appointment, you are told you need a resume, which you can’t make on your own (those computer skills again). They help you build one, but this takes more than one appointment. You have been applying for work on your own but don’t get many responses – likely because of your applications. This process becomes tedious and diminishes your self-esteem.
Folks living paycheck to paycheck likely have little or no savings to back them up in an emergency either, right? So now you are past due on rent and getting a notice to quit. Eventually you end up in shelter and are told you need to get a job when you’ve been trying to gain employment for months already. Are you frustrated yet? A little defeated?
Now, picture you are applying for work while staying in shelter and after three weeks, you get a job offer. It’s only part time, but it’s better than nothing, right? You are told you can’t be housed with that income. It’s another two weeks before you receive a check and it’s only for a few hours. Eventually, you ‘time out’ of shelter because the job you got isn’t enough and you aren’t eligible for a housing voucher so out to the street you go. Even if you aren’t struggling with mental health or addiction, being unhoused can feel like navigating a landmine field.
While working as a program manager in this system, I have witnessed many heartbreaking situations where those who want to succeed are sidetracked by the fishbowl dynamic that occurs within shelter. Dozens of these people, gainfully employed and contributing to society at the time, are sabotaged by the system that is tasked to help them – all while taking no responsibility. It is clear to staff, clients and many previously housed (or never housed) individuals that in many instances, those in charge are more concerned with legal liability and their own personal reputation than the outcomes they create. Some leaders aren’t even present at their own facilities. This shouldn’t be allowed. The disconnect between government agencies, agency leaders and issues is alarming and sad. All they have to do is listen.
I say WE ARE THE PROBLEM because the public has a limited understanding of homelessness or poverty in general. We judge, we criticize, we don’t want to pay for them, and we don’t want them in our back yard, regardless of if they have been our neighbor all along. 
The fact is, they are and have been. WE ARE THE PROBLEM because our government doesn’t support its most vulnerable people the way they need to be supported. Rental caps, funding for holistic mental health and longer-term support so no one is left behind would be a great start. 
WE ARE THE PROBLEM because we put people in positions of authority and leave them unchecked. Third party reviews should be required for all non-profit agencies, not just for CARF Certification or clout. Reviewers should be onsite for regular unannounced auditing of daily procedures as well as a review of leadership practices. This should include a standard of overall well-being and physical safety for clients and frontline staff.
All Connecticut residents can benefit from the success of the chronically unhoused. When supported, they contribute to the community in ways that others cannot, but it would also decrease public risks that aren’t always considered. Public health, property and violent crime, and environmental damage are just the tip of the iceberg. 
We have a golden opportunity to help our neighbors and finally experience all the value they can bring to the table.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 04:01:23+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s fiscal guardrails are a tax on the public good,Yonatan Miller,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/cts-fiscal-guardrails-are-a-tax-on-the-public-good/,We should start calling the fiscal guardrails what they are: a regressive tax.,"“Better the occasional faults of government that lives in a spirit of charity than consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.”
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose sweeping New Deal reforms transformed post-depression America, spoke these words in a rousing nomination speech that he delivered at the Democratic National Convention on June 27, 1936. FDR also set a new governance ideal for the Democratic Party: to use a “spirit of charity” in order to create, support, and sustain government institutions, recognizing that they are not businesses or commodities, but a public good.
Democrats in Connecticut hold all of the levers of power, including a veto-proof supermajority in the state house and senate. But despite the state’s $480.3 million General Fund surplus and overflowing reserves, Connecticut Democrats have subordinated the public good to an even “higher” ideal: the fiscal guardrails.
Years of contrived austerity have demonstrated to voters that no public good (indeed, nothing at all!) is more important than aggressively paying off Connecticut’s pension debts and filling up the state’s Budget Reserve Fund, which will top $6 billion this year.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat and the most influential champion of the guardrails, closed this year’s legislative session with the claim of “no new taxes.” Perhaps this is true on your W-2, and the withholding of state taxes from your salary (already among the highest in the nation) will not change. But our municipal taxes are at record highs, because the fiscal guardrails merely shift the burden of supporting underfunded services away from the state onto local governments.
Despite Connecticut having one of the highest effective state tax rates in the country, the system of guardrails and caps has meant dramatically less support of our state institutions. This only hurts the people who need their services most, who already are under strain from regressive state taxes.
Steep cuts to our public colleges and universities make as much sense as putting regular gas in a Corvette. It may save a few bucks in the short term, but it will result in degraded performance and damage that are far more costly in the long term. Students and their families pay the repair bill with increased tuition on top of their sky-high taxes. State support for UConn, for example, is 30% lower today than it was in 2008; it should come as no surprise that tuition is now 20% higher, and rising.
We should start calling the fiscal guardrails what they are: a regressive tax. “Fiscal guardrails” is too kind a euphemism for a generational wealth transfer that makes today’s taxpayers pay for the sins of previous administrations.
Governor Lamont has made stringent enforcement of the guardrails his signature policy. But he has failed to justify to Connecticut taxpayers how the benefits of making aggressive debt repayments outweigh the costs of harm to our state institutions in the here-and-now.
Keeping our state institutions in a state of perpetual financial crisis means that more time gets spent on budget triage than helping people who need their services. This is hardly a fiscally responsible use of the few tax dollars that the state is actually able to appropriate for the budget.
What was enacted by legislation can be changed by legislation, and the supermajority possessed by Connecticut Democrats removes any impediments to putting constitutional amendments on the table. Our lawmakers cannot continue to pretend as though there is no legal process to make even small adjustments to the caps or to draw funds from the Budget Reserve Fund.
Investing our hard earned tax dollars into debt repayments and amassing huge cash reserves while willfully cutting critical social services is the very definition of what FDR warned us about: a “government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.”

Dan Sullivan gives an annual address to the Alaska State Legislature on Mar 20, 2025 (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, took questions from Alaska reporters on Tuesday, in an hourlong phone news conference. He expressed praise and support for the Trump administration’s agenda with the federal budget megabill, saying, “No state fared better from the bill” than Alaska. 
The following transcript of the news conference has been lightly edited to improve readability:
Sen. Dan Sullivan: Thanks everybody back home. You should have gotten a very big, detailed press release that we just sent out. It’s a big bill, a lot there, and what I want to do is kind of cover the highlights, and then be glad to take your questions. But, look, I think this was a huge opportunity for our state. There’s no perfect bill, but a lot that’s in this bill are things that we’ve been working on, not just for months, but for years. And it was a great opportunity with like- minded members of the Senate to really, really advance Alaska’s interests across a whole host of areas. And I think it’s safe to say that no state fared better from this bill than our state, and I’m going to give you a couple of reasons why that’s the case. 
No. 1 and first and foremost, across a whole host of areas, to me, this is a jobs bill. This is a bill about growing our economy, and taking advantage of opportunities. You know, in 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). It was considered historic when we did that in that bill. This bill puts into law lease sales, not just for ANWR again, but for NPR-A (National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska). It goes back to the Trump era, integrated activity plan of 2020, for Cook Inlet and for opportunities for timber sales in the Chugach, in the Tongass. Very importantly, these mandated lease sales are in the law which protects us from, to be frank, administrations, like Joe Biden that we experienced for four years, when they came in with executive orders to try to shut us down. And something, again, we’ve been trying to get done for a long time: Every single one of these big federal areas, ANWR, Cook Inlet, NPR-A, is now at a 70-30 revenue share between the state and the feds. The state getting 70 (percent), and the feds getting 30 (percent). Now these start later in the 2034 period, but for those of you who know our history on resource development, we’ve been trying to get that kind of share more towards the state for decades. So we were able to achieve that across the board. So this is going to be very big for jobs, really important for additional revenues for our state Legislature and state government because of this. And then a whole bunch of other energy provisions, one of which is the new Energy Dominance Council, funded up to a billion dollars. And that’s something that, already, our AKLNG (Alaska liquefied natural gas pipeline) project and the secretary of energy are focused on to help advance that project even more. So big wins on economic growth, resource development. If we get this into law, with President Trump’s executive orders on Alaska, this is going to be a really, really exciting time for our economy. 
So next, a real focus here on tax relief for hard-working families and small businesses. As many of you know, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included across-the-board tax cuts for small businesses, middle-class families, doubling of the child tax credit to support working families — all of that expires at the end of this year. So without this tax reform, this budget reconciliation bill, there would be about a $4.5 trillion tax increase. Alaska’s small businesses would be crushed, middle-class families would be crushed. So by extending the 2017 tax cuts, we avoid a massive tax increase. There’s a whole host of new provisions. These are bills that I co-sponsored to focus on making child care more affordable for families with young children. The list, I won’t go through it, it’s in the press release. It’s a really big part of this bill. Alaskans have been reaching out to our office saying child care, child tax credits, employer-provided child care provisions are really important. When I gave my speech at the Legislature last year, there was a lot of talk about that. We hit historic levels of that (funding) for middle-class families. 
I want to get to a couple other areas that I think are important. This is an area that is really important to Alaska, that really hasn’t made hardly any news. I’m the chairman of the commerce committee subcommittee in charge of the Coast Guard. This bill has the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history, nearly $25 billion. Think about this, the Coast Guard’s annual budget is about $11.5 billion. So this is a massive investment, and it’s all in Coast Guard assets: 16 new icebreakers – we think icebreakers are really important; 22 new cutters, a $300 million port infrastructure in Juneau to homeport the ice breaker, the Storis. We’re going to have a ribbon cutting in Juneau in August. I’ve been working on these icebreakers, homeporting in our state for 10 years. Forty new helicopters – a lot of these Coast Guard assets are going to be coming to our state. There’s almost $5 billion in additional shore-side infrastructure that will be spread across the country. Again, a lot of that will be coming to communities like Sitka, Seward, Kodiak. These are really, really important elements of the Coast Guard. But as you guys know, when you’re builing out infrastructure, $300 million, for example, in Juneau for the new port facilities, that’s a lot of jobs. So it’s very exciting. 
Related to the Coast Guard are the provisions to secure the border and fight fentanyl. As you guys know, we’ve had the highest overdose rates in fentanyl for the last two years. There’s a real big commitment – $46 billion to build the southern wall, $8 billion for Border Patrol facilities. And a lot more for the kind of nuts and bolts of a more efficient immigration system, the immigration court system, federal courts, detention facilities. So the president has already shut down the border, almost 99% decrease in illegal aliens. But we have a huge challenge still with fentanyl, with drug cartels, and this is going to shut that down.
Building up our military – $150 billion for our military. Again, a lot of this goes to taking care of our troops. It builds on the historic pay raise — 14.5% — we had for enlisted personnel last year. That’s the highest pay raise ever. Twenty-five billion dollars for the president’s Golden Dome. That’s missile defense. Some of you may have seen, I introduced my Golden Dome Act about two weeks ago. A lot of that — a significant amount of that is going to be coming to Alaska, because we remain the cornerstone of missile defense. So that’s very exciting for our state. Again, national security, but jobs. One thing that’s in there, it’s kind of a small item, but we think really important. Again, a lot of us have been working on this for years:, $115 million to support the exploration and development of existing Arctic infrastructure, like reopening the Naval Air Station at Adak. So a really, really important component of our military. Nationally, of course, there’s a lot focused on ship building, a lot focused on the Indo-Pacific, but a lot of that is going to help our state. 
Another area that’s really important for the country, but also our state: upgrading Alaska and our nation’s aviation system – we have about $12.5 billion for nationwide air traffic control reforms and upgrades, and a significant amount, about $120 million, will be coming to our state building on the $25 million annually that the president and (U.S. Transportation) Secretary Duffy announced for the Alaska FAA Safety Initiative. So we’re building on that. 
Then finally, I wanted to mention the area where we’re going to be strengthening Alaska’s health care. You know, you may have seen, there’s a lot of ads back home, I think false ads, talking about me and this bill. Here’s the facts on the bill: It doesn’t touch Medicare, doesn’t touch Social Security, despite some of these false ads saying to the contrary. And the major reform in this bill is the Medicaid reform that centers around limitations and reductions in states’ use of what are called provider taxes and directed payments. States use that to enhance their federal Medicaid payments. That’s where the reforms in Medicaid are. We are the only state that doesn’t use provider taxes or state-directed payments, so the Medicaid programs and federal funds that the state receives are not impacted by the provided tax reforms in this bill, because we don’t do that. We’re the only state that doesn’t do that. 
So what we have been able to do, and what we’re working on, even as late as last night is to have a very significant, I got a plus up last night to $50 billion in the legislation for rural hospitals, and rural health care that will go to states. There’s a flat rate that — how much that will go — it’s about $100 million a year. And in discussions with senior administration officials, I am very confident that the state of Alaska, contrary to some of the ads on TV that we’re focused on cutting Medicaid, will be getting at least about $200 million a year for the next five years, in addition to what we’ve already gotten in Medicaid. That is a very significant plus-up that will go to the state, it will be able to be used for Medicaid-backlog challenges. And we think that that’s going to be a really, really important innovation, and that was something that I played a lead role in, in the last several weeks. 
There are common sense work reforms that are both in the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and the Medicaid provisions. Some of you might be familiar with the Clinton-era welfare reforms, that was a bipartisan work requirement during the Clinton administration. That was 30 hours a week, this is about a third less. It’s 20 hours a week, for able-bodied individuals who have no dependents, who are not disabled, who do not have mental health challenges, or are not seniors. And there’s a way in which that’s going to work for Medicaid, for SNAP. But we were able to get provisions that take Alaska’s unique challenges with regard to the work requirements. For example, all Alaska Natives are exempt from both work requirements on SNAP and Medicaid. That was something that I worked for hard in this bill. And then there are other provisions that, if you’re showing good-faith efforts to make these work requirements, you get extended periods. So those are important as well. 
And then finally, as I mentioned, there’s a whole host of areas where we’re making sure we’re taking care of seniors, elders. There’s a provision it’s about $12,000 per couple for tax deductions to reduce Social Security taxes. This builds on my Social Security Fairness Act that passed at the end of last year, for more take-home money for seniors. And some of the other areas: 100% federal Medicaid match for all Alaska Natives. As I mentioned, complete work requirement exemptions for our Alaska Native communities, many of whom live in rural areas, and that’s very hard to undertake these work requirements. And a final thing that I just wanted to mention. You know, the implementation of this bill, as I mentioned — long night last night, but we’ve been working on some of these things for years. 
There’s been some articles, and I want to just clarify it, because it’s important for people to know the way this works in the budget reconciliation process is that you have to make sure the provisions of the bill are compliant with what’s called the Byrd rule. The Byrd rule is a parliamentary statutory procedure dealing with budgetary and tax issues. The provisions of the bill typically have to meet that Byrd rule, but that’s not self-executing. The way in which provisions are challenged is that a Democratic leader, a Republican leader, will go to the parliamentarian and say, ‘Hey, I want this provision stripped out of the bill because it violates the Byrd rule.’ So the leadership on either side of the political aisle here has to proactively go after provisions that they want to strip out of the bill. What I saw, and it was pretty remarkable, pretty shocking, to be perfectly honest. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, on literally every provision that I’ve talked about that benefited Alaska. And it is a long list, the ANWR leases, NPR-A, Cook Inlet, a fund for rural hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii, an FMAP (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) increase – that I’ve been working on for years to get a federal match requirement for Medicaid to be increased in Alaska and Hawaii – ice breakers, homeporting in Juneau, border security, heck, even charitable deductions for Alaska Native whaling communities, every single one of these things — flexible SNAP requirements — Chuck Schumer and the Democrats came after us to try to strip out of this bill. So it’s a little ironic to me, particularly when I’m seeing far-left groups align with Schumer running millions of dollars of ads back home, saying wrongly, ‘Dan Sullivan wants to, you know, cut Medicaid,’ when the only guy cutting Medicaid in Alaska was Chuck Schumer yesterday when he went after our FMAP provision for Alaska and Hawaii, and unfortunately, he was successful. So the bill had a really good federal match increase provisions for Alaska and Hawaii for Medicaid, and Schumer got it removed. That’s hundreds of millions of dollars for Alaskans getting Medicaid money that the minority leader, Democrat leader of the U.S. Senate took out of the bill yesterday. But we kept fighting back, and this bill, like I said, is still a very strong bill, we think, for our state. And appreciate all the interest, and would love to take your questions.
Brian Venua, KMXT: So one of the things I was curious about, (Alaska U.S. Sen. Lisa) Murkowski said in her statement, in an email that the bill, while there’s good provisions, it’s not good enough for the rest of our nation and hopes that this isn’t a final draft. I was curious, what are your thoughts about that sentiment? And you know, what are some parts of it that you’re worried about or would change if you had, like, a magic wand?
Sen. Sullivan: Brian, you know, as you can imagine, I’ve been working with Sen. Murkowski on these provisions for years. And last night, you know, we were all working together and our staffs, that’s kind of a daily thing. I didn’t see her statement, but my understanding from what you said, I know for a fact that she thinks, like I do, that this is a strong bill for Alaska, and I think it is. And so, to be honest, that’s been my focus. Heck, even in Washington, D.C., there’s been some news commentary, even some politicians on both sides of the aisle saying, you know, this bill was a home run for Alaska. Some were critical that it was so good for Alaska. I take it as a badge of honor that this bill has a lot of really good things for Alaska, so that was my focus. I will say that, you know, for me, if I had a magic wand – I had been working on this FMAP provision, that’s the federal match for Alaska and Hawaii, because we both have statutory costs of living levels that are higher than any other place in the country. In the FMAP, it’s kind of complicated, but the formula for your FMAP is based solely on per-capita income, and ever since I became a senator, I’m like, that’s unfair. It should be based on the cost of living and the cost of health care. So I was able to get this FMAP provision to increase our federal match to 65%, and would increase Hawaii’s to 15%. I talked to the Hawaiian senators like, hey, let’s do this together. It’s bipartisan, you guys agree with this provision. And for whatever reason, Chuck Schumer tried to strike it. We fought it really hard. It took us two days. We were fighting in front of the parliamentarian saying, this complies with the Byrd rule. We ended up losing. And you know, that was a real loss, not just for Alaskans, but Hawaiians. But we readjusted and had a more robust provision in the rural health care fund that I talked about, that I still think is going to be a couple hundred million a year for Alaska on health care.
Delcenia Cosman, Homer News: How does the new Medicaid work requirement, outlined in this bill, how would that affect seasonal workers such as the Homer fishing fleet and tourism employees that are not necessarily employed year round?
Sen. Sullivan:  So the work requirement is 20 hours. As I mentioned, 30 hours was the standard under the Clinton administration, but it doesn’t include, as I mentioned, people with dependents, the elderly, and disabled. So there’s a broad exemption in terms of work requirements. And remember, the work requirement is, it’s not just work – you can volunteer for 20 hours. You can go to training for 20 hours. So there’s a whole host of ways in which you can meet that. And then we had provisions that completely exempted all Alaska Native communities in that but we did make adjustments exactly to your question, for seasonal workers, and we also made adjustments — and these are things that Sen. Murkowski and I got in — for areas of the state that have traditionally high unemployment. So to your question, we did make adjustments in that regard, and we can send you the details of that. I don’t have the provision right now in front of me.
Liz Ruskin, Alaska Public Media: Hi there, Senator, the bill extends tax cuts, it creates tax cuts. And as you noted, it spends a lot of money on Coast Guard and defense and other items. It was projected to add more than $3 trillion to the national debt. I’m not sure what the new score is, but are you comfortable with that addition to the national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: Well, look, Liz, when we look at this, there’s this big kind of debate on the baseline, the use of the way in which CBO (Congressional Budget Office) does the score, and the way in which we’re looking at this, this actually has historic savings of about roughly $1.6 trillion, right? And you know, the big debate is that we believe, and you probably saw this debate in Washington, D.C., that the debt and deficit should be marked from the current baseline right and current policy baseline. What that means is — and even the Obama administration had done this during their budget reconciliation — that it assumes that these taxes were not going to continue. So that was the different challenge here and when we’re pretty sure that the tax cuts were going to continue, and so we think the $3 trillion if you look at it from a current policy baseline, is actually quite inaccurate. So as you know, there’s a big debate on this topic, but we think that that $3 trillion assumes that the tax cuts were going to expire, but under current policy, which is the way we viewed this, that’s $3 trillion that we didn’t think was the accurate score under the CBO score.
Ruskin: So do you think this bill lifts us out of debt, that we have no problem with national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: No, I think we have a huge problem in national debt. I mean, to be honest. You know, last year, we had $37 trillion in debt, and we paid out $950 billion in interest, which is more than we paid for the Pentagon. So what we need to be doing, from my perspective, is reforming programs, which you’re seeing with Medicaid, but also growing the economy, and that’s why keeping the tax cuts extended is going to be really important. So this, we believe, is going to reduce the deficit by about $508 billion. And I think the key, as you know, it’s not just $35 trillion, which is a huge number, it’s the percent of GDP that your debt is. And this is going to start, we believe, with the strong economic growth that will come with this, start to reduce the debt. If you remember, CBO doesn’t always get these scores right. When we did the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they underestimated the growth by about one and a half (percentage) points, and they underestimated the revenues that would come in by about $1.4 trillion. So the key is, you got to have savings, which this bill does, but you can’t grow your way out of a … $35 trillion debt, you got to — I’m sorry, you can’t cut your way out. You got to grow your way out. So the key here is strong economic growth.
Iris Samuels, Anchorage Daily News: So my question is about Medicaid in Alaska, we’ve heard from a lot of concern that the new eligibility requirements would cause thousands of eligible Alaskans to lose access to Medicaid. So my question for you, Senator, is do you think that the number of uninsured Alaskans is going to increase after the passage of this bill?
Sen. Sullivan: So do you mean uninsured in terms of people not receiving Medicaid, or just uninsured as it relates to another issue?
Samuels: The number of Alaskans who don’t have health insurance. So if you also want to address the potential expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, that would also be helpful.
Sen. Sullivan:  Yeah, look, I think the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits is an important issue, and it wasn’t addressed in this bill. And as you know, that expires at the end of the year, and I think it’s something that I’m hopeful that there’s going to be a bipartisan consensus to address that, but it wasn’t. And to be honest, I think that some of the issues related to that, you know, in a bill like this, you can’t fit everything under the constraints of the Byrd rule. There’s a lot of things here, like I said, my FMAP provision that got taken out of this bill when Schumer challenged it. So that’s one that I don’t think would fit under here, but I think it’s an important issue that we have to look at. It’s kind of a cliff, I don’t think we should have a cliff in terms of those people who are relying on that for their health care. In terms of the backlog for Medicaid. I actually think this bill is going to help that. Again, we are not like other parts of the state, going to see any kind of dramatic reduction, any kind of reduction in our Medicaid federal dollars, because we don’t use provider taxes, and we don’t use state-directed payments, which is where all the reforms are for this bill. So the estimates of about $200 million a year from this rural health provider fund that’s in the bill. It’s a $50 billion fund. I was able to get that doubled in the last couple days, because I think it’s very important for rural communities. I think that that is actually an opportunity for our state to undertake reforms to get at the (application processing) backlog with a lot of that money. We’ve been talking to the governor and his team, and I think that they see that it’s an opportunity.
You know, there have been some stories that with the work requirement, some people might choose not to either work or volunteer, or go to school, or go to training for 20 hours a week. And if they choose not to do that, and they are eligible for the work requirement, you could see Medicaid for those individuals slipping. But we don’t think that that’s going to be a high number. And those are really the only areas in which I could see a Medicaid slippage in the state, because we’re not losing funding. To the contrary, with the estimated $200 million plus, I think it’s being more than $200 million a year from this fund. The state’s going to have a lot of opportunities to make reforms to the program. It’ll make it more efficient and serviceable for the people.
James Brooks, Alaska Beacon: Senator, I talked to Sen.Murkowski, and she said she agonized over her decision whether to vote for or against this. Was there ever a point where you questioned whether you would vote for it, and if so, what was it over?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, James, I did. Look, so I know I kind of sound like a broken record, but I’ve been really, really, really focused on this FMAP provision for Alaska. And again, I don’t want to sound too technical, but it’s the federal match requirement for Medicaid. We have one of the lowest matches in the country. We used to be 50%: 50% state and 50% federal. That’s the lowest in America. We’re about 51% right now, which is still really low. And it would always really bug me, because that formula is just pure per-capita income. That’s how they do it, which is why we have a low formula. It doesn’t take into account your cost of living, and it doesn’t take into account the high cost of health care delivery, which we have in those two categories, the highest in the country. So I’ve always said, ‘Hey, we need a much higher FMAP.’ And I’ve been working on this for years, because I just think it’s unfair to Alaska. There’s states that have 80-20 (percent) if you can believe that. Certain states have statutory FMAP – DC has a 70% statutory FMAP. The American territories, Marianas, Virgin Islands, have like an 80% FMAP, and we’re at 50 (percent). So I literally went all the way to very senior folks in the administration and all my Republican colleagues, saying, ‘I need this provision.’ And I explained why, and I got support from the White House, and I got support from all my Republican colleagues, and my provision was actually us and Hawaii, because they had similar challenges. And I will tell you when it got stripped out by Sen. Schumer, it was a giant, enormous frustration of mine, because I’ve been working on this and I care really deeply about this issue. I’ve been working on this issue almost since I got to the Senate. So I had a little bit of a dark night of the soul when that happened. And then we tried to fix it several times, different kind of tweaks and the parliamentarian and the Democrats kept challenging it and we kept losing. So I’m not sure it was a moment where I was going to say, ‘I’m not going to do this,’ but it was a moment of enormous disappointment when you’re trying it and you’re very close. Because remember, this was in the bill, my FMAP provision was in the budget reconciliation bill that we voted to get on four days ago. And when you work hard on something that you know is right for the people you represent, and then it kind of goes down the drai: It was frustrating, very, very frustrating to me. And we’ll re-attack it. The way I did it was, it was my initiative to get permission from my colleagues to plus-up this rural fund. It’s a very big rural fund now, $50 billion and to get essentially the equivalent for Alaska of what my FMAP provision would have been. My FMAP provision would have been about an additional $180 million a year for Alaska for Medicaid. And this rural fund actually gets more for us, about $200 million probably it might even go up to almost $300 million, so that was the moment. That’s a long answer, but I’ve been working on this issue for a really, really long time. I feel very passionate about it. And I was close, and it slipped away from me, because Schumer actually was the one who took it out, right? And it’s very ironic. You watch all these ads, you guys are seeing them ‘Dan Sullivan supposedly cutting Medicaid.’ That’s the false attack by Schumer’s affiliated groups. And you know, he’s the only guy cutting Medicaid in Alaska. I mean, he did it the other night, and it was really disheartening for me.
Jack Barnwell, Fairbanks Daily News Miner: Senator, this bill calls for the eventual sunsetting of the clean energy tax credit. Do you have any concerns about how that will affect projects in rural Alaska that might rely on these projects, and don’t have any direct benefit from natural gas or the high diesel and fuel rates costs?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, Jack, it’s a really good question. And I will tell you, it was a big component of the debate that was going on. We were able to get a much more generous kind of runway than what was in the House bill that came over. The House bill had this provision that was much more stringent on when the subsidies for those kinds of renewable projects would go away, and we were able to extend that. And then you may have seen there was also this provision in the House bill that they called an excise tax that was kind of a penalty. We got that actually removed in the Senate bill yesterday. And you know, one of the things that we were making the argument on, particularly for Alaska, is that our construction season and start for the timeline of these production and investment tax credits is so short up here. And that we needed an extended and better, phased-out timeline. We did get that to some degree, certainly an improvement from the House bill, but it’s still, I think, a concern to some. Now, as you know, some of these subsidies have been going on for many, many years, and it’s important for some of these industries to not have to rely on it. But I think the timeline extension was what we were trying to achieve and we got that some degree. And getting rid of this excise tax, which is essentially a penalty, we did achieve that in the bill. So good question. A lot of debate on this over the last several weeks, and that’s where we ended up.
Katie Stavick, Mat-Su Frontiersman: I just wanted to know, because of all the changes to the Senate version of the bill and now it goes back to the House. Are you worried at all about the bill not passing the House as it is now?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, Katie, it’s obviously the million dollar question. So as you probably have seen, on budget reconciliation, there’s a lot of back and forth, right? Before you go to the reconciliation part of the bill, you have to do what’s called a budget resolution. And we were doing that in the spring. We passed that in the Senate. We sent it back to the House. They sent it back to us. Those are the precursors to getting on the bill itself, the budget reconciliation bill. And the reason all this is important, it’s under the 1974 Budget Control Act, and Democrats and Republicans both use that act, the reason it’s important that you have to comply with the procedures and comply with the Byrd Rule — which is why it’s so important — is that in the Senate, you only have to get 51 senators to pass these kind of provisions. You know, I get along with my good Democratic friends in the Senate, but none of them would ever support the provisions that we got on ANWR, that we got on NPR-A, that we got on Cook Inlet, they just wouldn’t, right? So we needed this budget reconciliation bill to just be able to have Republican senators and House members vote and pass legislation that fits within the Byrd rule, so there’s a 51 Senate threshold. So that’s why all this is really important, that rules are quite arcane, but there’s already been a lot of back and forth between the House and Senate on the resolutions. Now this is the real, you know, the real live bill. You might remember the budget reconciliation bill started in the House. It came over to us (the Senate). 
It’s kind of interesting, the speaker of the House came over to one of our lunches a couple weeks ago and said, ‘Hey, Senators, we really want you to not change this at all.’ Well, we tried to not change it much, but we changed it some, and now it’s going to go back over there. I think, you know, one goal would be for them to just pass it as is, but that’s going to be up to the speaker and the members of the House. But I think he’s moving forward. I know (Alaska U.S. Rep.) Nick Begich is back in D.C. If they can’t get to passing our legislation, as is, they could pass another version, and then we would go into what’s called a conference. Where leaders in the Senate, leaders in the House would meet, would try to hash out our differences. That’s a possibility, but I think certainly our preference in the Senate at this juncture is for the House to take our provision and pass it, or take our bill and pass it. I think the House Rules Committee already met today, and I think the speaker is really wasting no time on moving forward on our bill, and I hope that they can pass it.
Trill Gates, ABC & FOX Alaska: Hi there, Senator, I had a question about Planned Parenthood. It’s my understanding two of the last Planned Parenthood locations, one in Anchorage, one in Fairbanks in our state, are now being threatened of being closed with this bill. Where will Alaskans in need of their services go?
Sen. Sullivan: I mean, there’s a lot of, I think there are other options with regard to services — community health centers throughout the state, which are all over the state. And I think the discussion, Trill, I think it used to be very bipartisan on what was called the Hyde Amendment, which was that federal funds should not be used to provide abortions. And that’s still the law of the land, but I think in terms of other services, for other health care type services — hospitals, community health centers, I think are areas in which those kinds of services can be provided.
Jeff Landfield, Alaska Landmine: I have more of a philosophical question. You know, we have the highest SNAP error rate, it was 60% I think, it might be down a little bit, but it’s much higher than the national average. And, you know, a third of the state is on Medicaid, and FMAP and the Indian Health Service, it’s a 100% match. Do you think the state needs to take steps to try to fix these problems and have people not so reliant on the federal government for health care and food stamps?
Sen. Sullivan: Well, Jeff, I think it’s a really important question. And our error rate on the SNAP provision the last couple years has been the highest in the country by far. It was 60% last year, which there’s not another state that’s even close to that. One of the things that we wanted to do on the SNAP provision we did get this in there, was to give states like ours with high error rates more time to fix the challenge. And I know the governor and the state Legislature are working on that. We were talking to the secretary of agriculture — Sen. Murkowski and I — with a provision we got in there that will grant her, essentially, the authority to let us go out to 2030 on fixing our error rate before any of the cost share provisions in the bill kicked in. And that was an important reform that we got in the bill. It was, you know, kind of trying to take care of our state in terms of getting control over this error rate, getting systems in place. You know, our error rate wasn’t always that high pre-COVID it was about 7% so I think COVID really undermined what happened in Alaska. 
So that’s one issue, and that’s a big part of the bill, and some of the somewhat Alaska-specific provisions that we got in the bill. The other one, though, I think, is a really important one, which is why I started my press conference with talking about private sector-led growth, giant great opportunities that are in this bill, historic opportunities that are in this bill. And I think you’re asking a really important question, because one thing that’s important is to make sure, and I did this in my speech to the Alaska Legislature earlier this year, is to say, ‘Hey, one of our goals should be to lift people off these programs.’ Remember Medicaid, if you’re disabled, pregnant, disabled, that’s who it was originally focused on. But, you know, you have the expansion population, which is 138% above the poverty level, able bodied. And you know, one of the goals I think we should talk about more is people in that category. Hey, there’s an opportunity with a really good job with the laborers or a great union that’s doing work on the (North) Slope. You get that job, you get great health care from the union, you get great private health care. You get off Medicaid, you have a stronger income coming in. So it’s an important issue that I think we need to remember that having more and more people on Medicaid and SNAP shouldn’t be the goal.  Those are safety nets that are very important, and I think they’re for Alaska, they are reinforced in this bill. But overall, I think we want to encourage people to be able to have jobs that move forward and get them, get them off those kinds of programs. 
And I also think that the work requirements are reforms that help in that way. Remember the Clinton administration did this with welfare reform, with 30 hours a week. It was considered controversial. I think a lot of people saw that it worked. This is about a third less in terms of requirement: 20 hours a week. And there’s a lot of ways in which individuals can meet that requirement. They can do volunteering, they can do training, they can go to school, they can get a job. So I think these kinds of reforms help in that direction that you’re asking and it’s important.
Ashlyn O’Hara, KDLL: Hi, Senator, I’d like to know more about the energy dominance financing program. I work for KDLL on the Kenai Peninsula, and there’s, of course, tremendous interest here about the Alaska LNG project. And are you able to be specific about how exactly the program would accelerate momentum on the project, and I guess as a kind of second part of that, or is it your intention to seek federal capital beyond the existing federal loan guarantees?
Sen. Sullivan: Ashlyn, great question, and the answer to your question is yes. One of the things that we are doing right now with Glenfarne (Group) and the Department of Defense is trying to see if there’s a way in which the Department of Defense can be a buyer of gas that would come down through the pipeline. That could dramatically lower the cost of capital, with regard to having a very big purchaser. Alaska LNG (pipeline) is going right past a lot of our military bases, so this is an issue I’ve raised with (U.S. Defense) Secretary Hegseth recently. I raised it in a breakfast I had with the deputy secretary of defense, just three weeks ago, and I raised it in a hearing with the assistant secretary for installations in charge of the Department of Defense. So the senior leaders of the Pentagon are very aware of this opportunity, and that Glenfarne is quite interested in that. 
And then, with regard to the Energy Dominance Council, what we did is we took, I think it’s called the Section 1706 provision that was in the IRA Act (Inflation Reduction Act), and we kind of reformed that to look at much bigger projects that relates to kind of big infrastructure, so nuclear, LNG and pipeline facilities, that can help increase capacity and base-load energy. That’s kind of the new way in which this 1706 energy dominance fund was reformed in the bill, and we got it capitalized with about a billion dollars. Which was important, because I was on a conference call with (U.S. Energy) Secretary Wright, and that’s the capitalization in the program. He is very interested in looking at the AKLNG project as one of the projects by which they would use this new energy dominance financing mechanism.
So they’re quite aware of it. We got a decent amount of money in it. I had a conference call with the secretary and the governor just two weeks ago. We are still trying to get the Department of Energy to set up the loan guarantees that Sen. Murkowski and I got in the bipartisan infrastructure bill several years ago. The Biden Administration never set that program up. It was four years of asking Secretary Granholm, hey, it’s in the law. We got it passed. You guys need to set it up. And they just kind of gave us the Heisman for four years. So we’re trying to get Secretary Wright and his team to set it up. So to answer your questions, you can kind of tell there are several different government financing angles that we are looking at. And if this law passes, this Energy Dominance Council will be a new one, and I think the secretary would like to target AKLNG as one of his projects.
Eric Stone, Alaska Public Media: Thanks, Senator. So I wanted to follow up on the idea that we’ll grow our way out of debt with the tax cuts. So like debt grew by $2.7 trillion between, shortly after the passage of the 2017 tax cuts, I’m going, you know, Jan. 1, 2018, to Jan. 1, 2020, this is before COVID. The debt grew by $2.7 trillion in that time. Why do you believe that extending these tax cuts further will, you know, help us grow our way out of debt, rather than adding to the national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: Because I don’t think you can cut your way out of a $36 trillion national debt, but I think the combination of savings – which this bill has very historic savings, about $1.6 trillion over 10 years – and growth, is really the key. And I think we’ve seen that throughout our country’s history. We’ve had different periods where we’ve had a very, very high debt-to-GDP ratio. That’s really the key indicator. Sometimes the numbers look daunting, but it’s really a measure of what your GDP is. And the White House Council of Economic Advisers thinks that this will help the GDP — debt-to-GDP go under 97%, with this bill because of the growth. It’ll be generated by it. And without it, they think it would be, you know, much higher, going about over 110%. 
So we’ve done this before, we grew out of a huge debt-to-GDP after World War II. I think on the growth side, after the 2017 tax cuts, you know, we were hitting 3% GDP growth. We were bringing in huge revenues. I think pre-tax cuts, it was about, I was looking at the numbers the other day, was about $3.5 trillion. It went up to almost $5 trillion, and then COVID hit and, you know, kind of all hell broke loose. So we had a very good, long meeting with the secretary of the treasury twice last week, and went through a lot of these numbers, and the Treasury Department thinks that we can hit them. But look, you never know. I mean, you’re asking a very fair question. There’s no doubt about it. But I think if you look at our history, the way you get out of these kinds of big holes, and we’re in a huge hole, is growth, is really, really the key.
Margaret Bauman, Cordova Times: Senator Sullivan, I want to go back to something you said at the beginning of the news conference, that “no state has fared better in this bill.” And you know, regarding issues like Medicaid and other economic issues, you’re very well traveled, and I just wonder how fair you think this is. Because the cost of living is high in Alaska, but there are absolutely pockets of extreme poverty all over this country. They’re in logging communities in the Rockies, they’re in Appalachia, they’re in little towns and big cities all over the country, because of the economic impact on individual families. There are families out there that are homeless, that don’t know where their next meal is coming from, and, you know, your obligation is to Alaska. But should Alaska be getting a hell of a better deal on all this than other states? Thank you.
Sen. Sullivan: Well, you’re right. I am focused on Alaska, and it’s hard to focus on other places. You’re right about there are other pockets of the country that have extreme poverty. We have extreme poverty, which is why, you know, we work really hard to get exemptions in so many parts of the legislation that relates to our state. And the other thing that we — I was really, really focused on, I’ve done it for a long time, as I mentioned this FMAP issue, but really, really pushed and got a big plus-up to the provider fund for rural hospitals and rural health care. That is a big deal to me. And in that fund, $50 billion is going to help states across America. As a matter of fact, the way in which we structure that fund, and my team and I were the ones who wrote the formula. We’re proud of this. We did not do it per capita. We’ve been down that road before. 
This fund has a minimum for every state across America, and that’s a $100 million minimum. Every state gets that. So to your question, that was something that my team and I devised, pushed hard on, funded significantly, and that helps every state. That’s not just an Alaska thing, but that’s going to help us huge. Because when you’re not per-capita income, sometimes we get the raw end of the deal on that. 
So, look, I’m not going to apologize for working hard for our state. That’s just my opinion. But back in D.C., there was a lot of chatter on the internet and stuff on how Alaska did really well in this bill: the energy part, the Coast Guard part, the military part, the tax part, the rural hospital fund. But I also think and I think you guys would all agree, we’ve been overlooked by the federal government, particularly in terms of infrastructure and health care, for years. Which is why I’m so obsessed with this FMAP provision, and when I couldn’t get it, when Schumer stripped it from the bill, we pivoted to this rural fund as a way to get those kinds of funds that we think our state needs. So it’s a good question, but as you can imagine, as a senator, I’m very, very, very focused on the people I represent. But I will say some of the initiatives that our team led on, like this big rural fund, are going to help everybody.

,DC,2025-07-03 02:45:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-was-beaten-and-tortured-salvadoran-prison-new-court-filings-reveal,,"WASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported in March to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there, his attorneys wrote in a late Wednesday filing.The filing, an amended complaint to the District Court of Maryland, provides the first disturbing details of what Abrego Garcia experienced at Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.His wrongful deportation has become the most high-profile example of the conflict between the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportations campaign and the judiciary’s call for the due process rights of immigrants.The allegations of torture also raise questions about the U.S. State Department’s payment to El Salvador of up to $15 million to detain about 300 immigrant men at CECOT, a possible violation of the human rights law known as the Leahy Law.The law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — such as military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.Hit with batons, forced to kneel for hoursWhen Abrego Garcia first arrived to CECOT, he was told by a prison official, “Welcome to CECOT. Whoever enters here doesn’t leave,” according to the filing from lawyers with Quinn Emmanuel, the firm representing Abrego Garcia in his immigration case.Abrego Garcia was later kicked, hit with wooden batons and beaten by Salvadoran guards on his first day at CECOT on March 15, according to the new filing.“By the following day, Plaintiff Abrego Garcia had visible bruises and lumps all over his body,” according to the complaint.While in a cell, Abrego Garcia and 20 other incarcerated Salvadorans were forced to kneel from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and guards would strike “anyone who fell from exhaustion,” according to the filing. During that time, Abrego Garcia was denied access to a bathroom and soiled himself.“The detainees were confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation,” according to the complaint.At CECOT, the guards would threaten to put Abrego Garcia in cells with gang members “who, they assured him, would ‘tear’  him apart,” according to the filing. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have denied he is a gang member.During his first two weeks at CECOT, Abrego Garcia’s health deteriorated, and he lost 31 pounds, his attorneys said.Transfers to two more facilitiesOn April 9, Abrego Garcia and four others were transferred to a differentsector in CECOT, “where they were photographed with mattresses and better food—photos that appeared to be staged to document improved conditions,” according to his attorneys.Around April 10, he was later transferred alone to a separate prison facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador. On April 10, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia — who had deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador since 2019.But for months, the Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador, and the United States could not force El Salvador to return him.At the new location, Abrego Garcia “was frequently hidden from visitors, being told to remain in a separate room whenever outside visitors came to the facility,” according to the filing.“During his entire time in detention in El Salvador, Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was denied any communication with his family and access to counsel until Senator (Chris) Van Hollen visited him on April 17, 2025,” according to the brief.The Maryland Democrat traveled to El Salvador in an effort to bring back Abrego Garcia, who is a longtime Maryland resident.Criminal chargesWhile Abrego Garica was returned to the U.S. last month, it was to face federal criminal charges lodged in Tennessee while he was detained in El Salvador. His attorneys have denied the charges of human smuggling and say they are nothing more than the Trump administration trying to save face.Abrego Garcia’s criminal case is being handled out of a Tennessee court and he’s being kept in jail due to fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will deport him.Department of Justice attorneys stated in the District Court of Maryland last week that the Trump administration plans to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country, but said the move was not immediate.Attorneys for Abrego Garcia are trying to move forward with discovery to determine if the Trump administration flouted the district court’s order and the Supreme Court’s order in refusing to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after the Trump administration admitted his deportation was a mistake.“Defendants’ disdain for the law and legal process, and their cruelty, shocks the conscience and demands immediate, sustained, judicial relief and oversight,” according to the complaint. “It also marks a profound constitutional crisis in which executive agencies have repeatedly and deliberately flouted the authority of multiple federal courts—including the Supreme Court itself.”“This defiance undermines the foundational principles of our constitutional system by eroding the checks and balances and rule of law that protect individual liberty from government overreach,” the attorneys continued.",,,,2025-07-02 23:01:38.885073

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to appear in court for possible release, a move federal prosecutors oppose

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Corrections announced that 35 men arrested and detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from out of state and held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex were transferred out of state on Monday.
ICE transferred 42 men to Alaska from out of state on June 8, as part of an ongoing agreement between the Department of Corrections and the U.S. Department of Justice, amid a nationwide deportation crackdown. The move sparked daily protests, a fact-finding hearing by the Alaska House Judiciary Committee, and concerns from attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska around the punitive conditions of detention, violations of due process and criminal confinement.
A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said department Commissioner Jen Winkelman was not available for an interview on Tuesday to discuss the transfer, concerns around conditions of detention, and ongoing plans to house ICE detainees in Alaska.
“The ICE detainees who were transferred due to severe overcrowding in the Washington facility are no longer in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections,” said DOC spokesperson Betsy Holley in an email, in which she included the italics and underlining. She added that all questions on the details of the transfer should be directed to DHS/ICE.
Cindy Woods, a senior immigration law and policy fellow with the ACLU of Alaska, said the transfer was not unexpected, since DOC had said they agreed to hold detainees for 30 days. She also said she and several other attorneys were not notified of the transfers.
“Yesterday evening, I flagged the attorneys that I know represent folks who had been transferred, to let them know that they were being transferred again, and but none of them had been told by ICE prior to that,” she said.
Woods said all the detainees were going through civil immigration proceedings, and faced no criminal charges.
“These individuals were all in civil detention, so they were not being detained as part of an ongoing criminal proceeding. They were all in administrative immigration proceedings,” she said, and a number of the men have applied for or received asylum protections.
“And then there were also a handful of folks who were waiting for their immigration proceedings to commence,” she said. “And so (they) were waiting for the opportunity to speak with a judge about either a potential asylum claim or some other request for immigration relief.”
The ICE transfer of detainees to Alaska DOC custody raised serious concerns around standards of detention from legislators and advocates. Attorneys testified before the June 20 hearing of the Alaska House Judiciary Committee that despite no criminal charges, their clients reported that they were subject to lengthy lockdowns, overuse of handcuffs and overcrowding — sleeping three to a cell. In addition, they were denied or had limited access to calls with family and attorneys, regularly strip-searched after visits with attorneys, and subjected to use of force by DOC staff members, who pepper-sprayed a unit to stop a “verbal demonstration” on June 12, the attorneys said.
The ACLU of Alaska sent a letter on Saturday to Alaska state officials and ICE demanding detainees be removed from Anchorage Correctional Complex custody, and a stop to any additional transfers “unless and until constitutionally adequate conditions of confinement and attorney access can be guaranteed.”
The letter provided further detail on the pepper-spray incident: “This ‘verbal demonstration’ consisted of detainees requesting access to their belongings, including an individual who was trying to access his property to get the phone number for his consulate. Following the incident, many individuals experienced respiratory distress, including coughing, burning sensations in their mouth, nose, and eyes, and nosebleeds, and did not receive medical attention. They were also unable to change their clothes for an extended period of time.”
Holley said in the Department of Corrections’ emailed response to an interview request that the state did not make the call to transfer the detainees.
“The decision to transfer these detainees out of Alaska rested solely with the federal government. The decision was not influenced by the recent House Judiciary Committee hearing or the letter issued by the ACLU this past weekend,” Holley said.
“It is important to note the Alaska DOC routinely houses both civil detainees and federal prisoners. While we do not currently know whether ICE will request additional placements in the future, the Alaska DOC remains fully prepared to support DHS/ICE in coordinated efforts that prioritize public safety and the efficient use of government resources.”
The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections in May challenging what they say is “inadequate, dangerous and inhumane” health care provided for incarcerated Alaskans.
Woods said the DOC protocols and detention conditions are unnecessary, and violated the men’s right to due process. “The conditions that they were all held in were punitive, whether or not that was the intention of the government, and such punitive nature are clearly outside the scope of the law, and especially when it comes to the standards and the requirements for civil detainees, who are not being held under criminal charges,” she said.
ICE did not respond to requests for comment about why the detainees were transferred to and from Alaska. Woods said she was able to search in the ICE inmate locator and confirm the men were transferred back to the ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, with reportedly better conditions.
Woods said detainees reported the experience in DOC custody as humiliating.
“They were being held in really substandard conditions, being subjected to pepper spray and strip searches, and handcuffs, and all of those things. And so it was really hard for a lot of people to deal with that shift,” she said, referring to being transferred from Washington state to Alaska custody. “And especially because they were also largely cut off from those outside relationships that sustained them, particularly those who, you know, regularly spoke with their children and their parents and their loved ones who were not located in the United States — having that kind of completely shut off really impacted the individuals who experienced that.”
On Friday, seven U.S. congressional representatives from Washington and Oregon sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security questioning why detainees were transferred to Alaska,  as well as the cost and criteria for who is transferred. The letter also raised concerns that “ICE is wasting taxpayer dollars, flying dozens of people between detention centers thousands of miles apart, in efforts that do nothing to help protect Americans.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)A coalition of concerned Utah health, food aid and housing advocates rallied together on a virtual call Wednesday to raise alarms about “devastating” fallout if the massive tax and spending bill that’s been dubbed President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” gets approved.
Estimates for how many people in Utah would be affected have been a moving target as the bill has made its way through Congress, but advocates warn tens of thousands could lose Medicaid coverage and thousands more in Utah who rely on the nation’s largest federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), could be at risk of losing food benefits. 
They also warned “lives are at stake” because the proposed cuts could especially threaten Utah’s rural hospitals and clinics, which could lead to reduced access to healthcare. Further, they said the cuts would have far-reaching effects that would lead to job losses, increased hunger, and declining health for people across the nation, including Utah. 
Analysis: Upwards of 80K Utahns could lose health insurance under ‘big, beautiful’ bill’

“Over 60,000 Utahns could lose Medicaid coverage because of these cuts, which we know will hit rural Utah particularly hard,” said Nate Crippes with the Disability Law Center, which is also a member of the Protect Medicaid Utah Coalition. “On top of the coverage loss many Utahns — including children, those who are low income, who have disabilities, who are aging — will also now face greater insecurity.” 
Crippes said “thousands of jobs” across Utah could be at risk due to economic fallout from the cuts. 
“While the impacts on some communities will be abrupt,” he said, “the aftershock will be felt by all Utahns.” 
After the U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill Tuesday, it now awaits another vote in the U.S. House. Wednesday, the bill hit a roadblock as far-right members of the House GOP objected to the Senate’s version. Members of the House Freedom Caucus balked at several provisions in the sprawling bill, including that it would increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion. 
But a vote in the House still looms. And though advocates acknowledged their complaints may be falling on deaf ears from Utah’s all-Republican congressional delegation, they said they’re not going to stop fighting or give up hope — even if the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP get approved. 
They urged Utahns to do the same — not give up. 
“Whether there’s hope or not, the correct thing for anybody individually to do is still to contact your Congress person and make the effort,” said Neil Rickard, a child nutrition advocate with the advocacy group Utahns Against Hunger. “At the very worst, you’ve emphasized that these are very real issues. Whatever happens with the outcome of this bill, the core issues that we’re talking about right now are still going to exist.” 
But if the bill does pass? Rickard said the fight to restore Medicaid and SNAP benefits is just beginning. 
“We have a huge problem on our hands and we need to start addressing it,” he said. “It’s very bad … but the work does not stop.”
‘Absolutely the wrong time’ to shift SNAP costs to states
Among the advocates who warned against the cuts Wednesday was Glenn Bailey, executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, which he described as the “agency of last resort” that provides food pantry assistance to low-income Utahns. 
US House GOP struggles to advance megabill against Freedom Caucus resistance

He said SNAP and Medicaid help people from “falling through the cracks” and ending up in food pantries to begin with. Today, Bailey said Crossroads Urban Center serves up to 13,000 people every month between its two food pantries, “and the need is continuing to go up” amid Utah’s increasing housing costs. 
“This is absolutely the wrong time to make cuts in the safety net, particularly in food resources that help single parents,” Bailey said. He added that adding “red tape” like work requirements or other barriers would be a “big mistake,” especially “for the most vulnerable people in our communities.” 
If the bill passes, Bailey said the federal government will be “spending a whole lot more money and exploding the national deficit in order to do less for the people who need it the most.”
“It’s a big mistake,” he said. 
How would Utah deal with the cuts? Former legislator weighs in
Marsha Judkins, a moderate Republican from Provo who is a former Utah legislator who served on the Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee for six years, said the cuts will likely affect Utahns who need the services rather than weed out fraud because, she said, fraud in Utah’s programs is rare.
Judkins, who did not seek reelection last year, said she’s seen first-hand how legislators are “very careful about the money received from the federal government.” 
“The Medicaid and SNAP programs in Utah have very little fraud, misuse or waste,” she said. “The application process is very rigorous, and the clients on these programs are often reviewed to make sure that they still qualify.”
The proposed cuts could lead to several possible scenarios, she said, but “all of them have some fairly severe consequences to every-day Utahns.” 
“Legislators could decide to make the cuts permanent, and then they would either cut people from the programs or cut the benefits they are receiving,” she said. “Who would be cut and the services that would be cut? New moms, possibly receiving postpartum care. Addiction recovery. Services for those who have serious mental illness. Children who have complex health needs. Patients battling cancer.”

While proponents argue the cuts are meant to go after people committing fraud, Judkins said, “in Utah we simply don’t have that problem, and it’s going to be real people who are going to be cut. And they’re going to be cut from programs that they truly need.” 
She also warned that “unintended consequences” could be increased hospital costs, increased hospital visits, longer wait times for care, and increases in health insurance premiums, “and that’s just to name a few.” 
Rural hospitals at risk
Matthew McCollough, rural hospital improvement director for the Utah Hospital Association, warned rural hospitals are especially at risk from the cuts. 
Roughly 1,300 “critical access” hospitals, or hospitals that are located in rural and underserved areas, currently exist across the U.S., with an average operating margin of only 2.5%, “so they’re barely getting by,” he said. He added that 46% of rural hospitals are operating with a budget deficit, while in states that have not expanded Medicaid, 53% of those hospitals are operating in the red. 
He added that 188 rural hospitals nationwide have already closed or converted to a rural emergency hospital status “because they were unable to keep the doors open.” And about 432 rural hospitals are already vulnerable to closure. 
“And that’s today,” he said, adding that the federal cuts would only further jeopardize “an already very vulnerable, fragile rural healthcare system.” 
He stressed that it’s important to realize “these are real people that need care.”

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state’s 1849 law banning abortion had been “impliedly repealed” by the Legislature when it passed laws over the past half century “regulating in detail the ‘who, what, where, when, and how’” of abortion.
The Court’s majority opinion, authored by Justice Rebecca Dallet and joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, finds that the Legislature could not have passed laws regulating abortion access if the 1849 statute was believed to remain in effect.
“This case is about giving effect to 50 years’ worth of laws passed by the Legislature about virtually every aspect of abortion including where, when, and how health-care providers may lawfully perform abortions,” Dallet wrote. “The Legislature, as the peoples’ representatives, remains free to change the laws with respect to abortion in the future. But the only way to give effect to what the Legislature has actually done over the last 50 years is to conclude that it impliedly repealed the 19th century near-total ban on abortion, and that [the statute] therefore does not prohibit abortion in the State of Wisconsin.”
Dallet wrote that when the Legislature passed laws restricting abortion under narrower circumstances, guiding “where, when and how” health care providers could perform an abortion and outlining how public money could fund abortion providers, it was repealing the 1849 law.
The ruling comes three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark Court ruling that found there was a constitutional right to abortion access and marks the conclusion of a legal dispute that helped Protasiewicz win election to the Court in 2023 and Susan Crawford win election this April.
In response, the Court’s three conservative justices filed dissents, accusing the majority of “propaganda,” “smoke-and-mirrors legalese” and “pure policymaking.”
“The majority’s smoke-and-mirrors legalese is nothing more than ‘painting a mule to resemble a zebra, and then going zebra hunting. But paint does not change the mule into a zebra,’” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Those in the majority know better, but they do so anyway because they like the result and promised to deliver it.”
In his dissent, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that the majority failed to show when the law was presumably repealed by the Legislature, saying that the opinion doesn’t properly address the Legislature’s actions in 2011 and 2015 amending the 1849 law.
“The majority does not say when over those 40 years the Legislature once and for all repealed [the statute],” he wrote. “Was it when the Legislature passed a postviability ban? A partial-birth abortion ban? A twenty-week ban? A waiting period? A physician licensing requirement? The majority fails to say.”
23AP2362 Mandate
Following the ruling’s release, the state’s Democratic elected officials and abortion access activists celebrated the decision as a “win” for reproductive health care in the state.
“Thanks to our lawsuit, today’s decision affirms that access to reproductive healthcare will continue to be available, helping ensure Wisconsin women today are not forced to face firsthand what it’s like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today is a win for women and families, a win for healthcare professionals who want to provide medically accurate care to their patients, and a win for basic freedoms in Wisconsin, but our work is not over. I will continue to fight any effort that takes away Wisconsinites’ reproductive freedom or makes reproductive healthcare, whether birth control, abortion, IVF, or fertility treatments, any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. That is a promise.”
Attorney General Josh Kaul, who brought the lawsuit against the law, said at a Wednesday morning news conference that the decision was an important step toward ensuring all Wisconsinites have the freedom to access abortion care, but that the Legislature should step up and further clarify the law.
“I thought we were right on the law. The arguments we made have now been vindicated,” Kaul said. “But at a time when the rights of Wisconsinites and Americans are under threat, this case is a stark reminder of how important it is that we fight for our rights, that we advocate for what is in the best interest of the people of our state, and that we stand on the side of freedom. Here today, we were able to achieve a significant victory for the freedom of Wisconsinites.”
Wisconsin’s state and federal Democratic lawmakers responded to the ruling by saying it wasn’t enough, promising to continue working to codify abortion access in law.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she will continue to work to enact her proposal to ensure women across the country have access to abortion care.
“Today’s ruling tells women across Wisconsin that we will not go back,” Baldwin said. “Today’s ruling tells women that our government trusts you to make decisions about your own body and your future. Today’s ruling tells women in our state that they are not second-class citizens. But, this fight is not over. Every woman, in every zip code, in every state deserves the same rights and freedoms. I will not stop fighting until we make that a reality and pass my bill to restore the right to abortion nationwide and allow women to make their own health care decisions without interference from judges or politicians.”
State Sen. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said the Legislature must now pass a bill guaranteeing the right to an abortion.
“Now that the courts have made it clear that Wisconsin does not have a total abortion ban, we must go further,” Subeck said. “It’s time to protect reproductive rights not just in practice, but in law. We must pass the Abortion Rights Restoration Act to guarantee the right to abortion and eliminate the medically unjustified, politically motivated restrictions that still exist in our state statutes. The people of Wisconsin deserve nothing less than full access to safe and legal reproductive health care without unnecessary barriers and free from judgement.”
In a concurring opinion, Karofsky wrote that interpreting the 1849 law as banning abortion gives the state the authority to “exert total control” over women and “strips women and pregnant people of the dignity and authority to make intimate and personal choices by exposing medical professionals who perform abortions to 15-year prison terms.”
In her opinion, Karofsky details the history of abortion access in the U.S. and highlights four women who died because of restrictive abortion bans, including the recent deaths of two Black women in Georgia and a Honduran immigrant in Texas as well as the death of her own great-grandmother in Boston in 1929.
“I tell the stories of Amber, Candi, Josseli, and my great-grandmother Julia to remind us that severe abortion restrictions operate like death warrants,” Karofsky wrote. “Under such restrictions women, children, and pregnant people are denied life-saving medical care while medical professionals are forced to sit idly at their bedsides, unable to do their jobs. Extreme abortion restrictions revive a time in our history driven by misogyny and racism, divorced from medical science; it is a world that must be left behind.”
In her dissent, Justice Rebecca Bradley accused Karofsky of rewriting history to achieve a desired outcome in the case.
“Not content with effacing the law, Chief Justice Jill Karofsky rewrites history, erases and insults women by referring to mothers as ‘pregnant people,’ slanders proponents of the pro-life perspective, and broadcasts dangerously false narratives about laws restricting abortion,” Bradley wrote. “Laden with emotion, steeped in myth, and light on the law, the concurrence reads as a parody of progressive politics rather than the opinion of a jurist.”

In its own pair of motions, Equality State Policy Center, which filed the lawsuit in May, urged the court Monday not to dismiss the case, arguing the new law “threatens voting rights.”
The law, which took effect Tuesday, makes proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship part of the voter registration process in Wyoming. The law also requires someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days. 
Such regulations are unconstitutionally vague and impose an undue burden on the right to vote, the lawsuit alleges. It names Secretary of State Chuck Gray in his official capacity as a defendant in the case, along with all 23 county clerks. 
The complaint’s profile has risen considerably since it was initially filed, first attracting high-profile attorneys to both sides of the case, then the attention of the Republican National Committee and a coalition of 25 states and Guam. Now, the Trump administration wants to have a say. 
“Requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote is a valid method for a State to achieve its interests in preventing fraud and safeguarding voter confidence in elections,” according to the DOJ’s filings. 
In a poll prior to November’s election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in 2024 to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey.
Gray, in a press release, welcomed the federal government’s involvement. 
“I am extremely grateful for President Trump’s and the DOJ’s leadership and prioritization of these important election integrity measures,” he said.
The harms described in the federal lawsuit are speculative, Gray’s attorneys have argued, and lack the kind of specificity required to have standing in a federal court. They’ve alleged that the nonprofit can’t point to specific examples of voters who will be disenfranchised by the new law.
In Monday’s filings, attorneys for ESPC pushed back on Gray’s suggestion, arguing that they’ve “submitted concrete evidence” and pointing to “three separate declarants attesting that they serve individuals who lack the identifying documents [the law] requires.”
“Secretary Gray is also incorrect that no voters facing a disproportionate impact are before the court,” the filing states. “For example, Plaintiff highlights the experience of domestic abuse survivors, thousands of whom live in Wyoming. These survivors are before the court as constituents of the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, one of the Plaintiff’s member organizations. And Plaintiff can adjudicate that harm on their behalf.” (Emphasis from the filing.)
Both parties have pointed to a legal doctrine known as Anderson-Budrick balancing, which “requires courts to weigh burdens that a state imposes on electoral participation against the state’s asserted benefits,” according to SCOTUSblog. 
But Gray’s attorneys have misconstrued the doctrine in his filings, according to ESPC’s motion, and “the Secretary offers no legally meaningful defense of the law. Thus, under binding precedent, and on this record, the Court should find Plaintiff is likely to succeed.” 
ESPC also filed a motion Monday opposing a proposed amicus brief from Guam and 25 states, including those that have passed similar voter registration laws to Wyoming. 
“For all states may posture during legislative sessions (or in amicus briefs) about the specter of non-citizen voting, the fact remains that there is no evidence that it is an actual problem — in Wyoming or anywhere else — and the amici tellingly point to none,” the filing states. 
The court made two decisions on Wednesday. 
For one, it set a deadline for ESPC to object to a separate proposed amicus brief from the Immigration Reform Law Institute — a legal nonprofit affiliated with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which was founded by white nationalist and anti-immigration activist John Tanton. Plaintiffs have until Tuesday to do so. 
The court also granted a motion designating the county clerks as nominal parties, meaning they will technically remain a part of the case but will not have any responsibilities. 
In the meantime, the court must still rule on the plaintiff’s request to halt enforcement of the new law pending the lawsuit’s outcome.

Labor and environmental advocates are attacking the Congressional Republicans' tax cut megabill for rolling back clean energy programs enacted in the Biden administration. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The tax cut megabill in Congress with a historic rollback on Medicaid also includes provisions reversing U.S. clean energy policies, advocates warned Wednesday, harming not only the environment but the economy.
“This legislation will kill economic growth and jobs, raise energy prices, and cede clean energy technology manufacturing to other countries,” said Carly Ebben Eaton, Wisconsin Policy Manager for the Blue Green Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.
Eaton took part in two online news conferences Wednesday to draw attention to the federal budget reconciliation bill and its repeal of key portions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
The budget bill has been the top priority of the Republican majority in Congress as well as the administration of President Donald Trump. It was drawn up to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term that will expire at the end of 2025.
The package returned to the U.S. House for final action after a tied vote in the U.S. Senate that required Vice President JD Vance to pass the measure on Tuesday.
Steep cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition programs have drawn the most attention during debate on the bill, along with the Congressional Budget Office finding that the wealthiest taxpayers will benefit most from its tax cuts.
The bill also includes measures that would undo several provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of the signature pieces of legislation enacted during President Joe Biden’s four years in office. After its passage the act was lauded by environmental advocates for provisions to address climate change by encouraging clean energy through tax credits as well as federal investments.
The House version of the GOP bill “already dealt a serious blow to clean energy tax credits and investments,” Eaton said Wednesday, “but the Senate took it even further, doubling down on cuts that will cost jobs, stall progress and raise energy costs.”
Consumer, business renewable energy incentives
The IRA’s tax breaks were designed to encourage consumers to move to energy-efficient and clean energy appliances and vehicles and encourage utilities and other businesses to increase their use of renewable resources such as solar energy and wind power.
Eaton said Wednesday that clean energy tax credits are supporting more than $8.6 billion in private investments in Wisconsin.
Garrik Harwick, assistant business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union Local 890 in Janesville, said that over the past three years more than 300 members have worked on solar projects in Southern Wisconsin. He spoke at a news conference with Eaton and several other union leaders.
The IRA tax breaks have encouraged those developments, Harwick said, and the investments have included increased apprenticeship slots, bringing in new trainees.
“These investments don’t just deliver clean energy,” Harwick added. “They create good paying union jobs that strengthen our local communities.”
He warned that repealing the tax credit will likely reduce the use of clean energy technologies and increase energy costs by 6% for homeowners and more than 9% for business customers.
The IRA’s provisions that encouraged apprenticeships helped “open doors that many didn’t even know existed,” said Andy Buck, government affairs director for the Wisconsin and Upper Michigan district of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.
He said the union has added a number of jobs, including apprentices, installing energy-efficient glass in buildings on projects that were facilitated by the Inflation Reduction Act.
“When someone enters a registered apprenticeship program, they aren’t just learning a trade,” Buck said. “They’re building a career, gaining self-respect, and finding a path to a better life.”
Another provision of the 2022 law opened up tax credits for renewable energy to nonprofit organizations and government agencies, allowing them to receive direct payments to the federal government comparable to the value they’d receive from the tax credit if they paid taxes.
A new middle school being built in Menasha will include solar panels and energy storage, said Matt VanderPuy, a business agent for the Sheet Metal workers union in Sheboygan. The direct pay program will reimburse the district $3 million, he said, while the energy savings is projected at $190,000 per year.
“This is money that they can reinvest into the students, the teachers and the school district,” while saving on property taxes, VanderPuy said.
‘Very ugly impacts,’ says advocate
At another news conference, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes observed that more than 90% of the jobs that IRA incentives helped create are in Republican congressional districts — although no Republicans in the state delegation voted for the bill. Barnes leads Forward Wisconsin, a nonprofit established during Biden’s term in the White House to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.
But business uncertainty this year, which Barnes blamed on GOP positions including Trump’s tariff executive orders, has led nationally to the cancellation of projects worth $15.5 billion, he said.
“The so-called big beautiful bill is going to have some very ugly impacts in Wisconsin, ripping away tax incentives for wind and solar farms, for rooftop solar, for farm sustainability programs, for clean cars and school buses,” said Amy Barrilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, at the event with Barnes. “And giving more tax breaks to big oil and gas companies does absolutely nothing to create jobs here or any opportunities here — it’s a gift to big oil at the expense of Wisconsin families and at the expense of our environment.”
Heather Allen, policy director for Elevate, an energy efficiency nonprofit, said as many as 11,000 clean energy and manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin could be at risk.
Plans for a $2.5 billion network of electric vehicle charging stations in the state have stalled, Allen said, and Wisconsin manufacturers that would have supplied components “are going to lose that opportunity now.”
“This legislation is going to strangle our solar businesses with red tape,” Allen said. “What you have here is an attack on small businesses that are delivering clean energy solutions to help families save money on their energy bills. And that includes solar installers, but it also includes other home energy contractors, other construction jobs.”
In four recent polls, a majority of those surveyed disapproved of the Republicans’  megabill — making it “more unpopular than any piece of major legislation that’s been passed since at least 1990,” Barnes said.
At the labor news conference, Emily Pritzkow, the Wisconsin Building Trades Council executive director, said advocates are urging people to contact their members of Congress.
“The polling on this is abysmal, and as long as people continue to call and deliver that message , that is what we need to do right now,” Pritzkow said. “Now is the time to weigh in, not once it’s coming to your front door, impacting you, your community, and people you care about.”

(Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)Even as U.S. House struggled to wrangle the votes to pass President Donald Trump’s major domestic policy initiative Wednesday, Minnesota progressives, food shelves and health care advocates sounded the alarm over the “big, beautiful bill” that would deliver steep cuts to Medicaid and food aid for low-income families.
“There are seniors who will not have care because of this bill. There are Minnesota low-income college students who will not be able to go to college because of this bill. There are people who will not be able to get health care, and people who get health care who are paying thousands of dollars more because of this bill,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, at a Wednesday rally in Minnehaha Park.
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed Trump’s plan that would extend 2017 tax cuts and slashes spending on the Medicaid program for low-income people and people with disabilities. The legislation also shifts significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time.
The U.S. House passed its own version of the bill in May and now House Republicans are facing pressure to pass the Senate’s version before Trump’s self-imposed Friday deadline. The Senate’s version includes steeper cuts to Medicaid compared to the House, though the House’s most far-right members want even more cuts and have threatened to withhold their votes if they don’t get their way.
Because of the tax cuts and increases in spending on defense and immigration enforcement, the plan would add about $3.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The richest 5% of American taxpayers would receive 44% of the net tax cuts next year, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
The bill would hit state Medicaid programs across the country. All told, changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in the Senate bill would cause 12 million additional people to be without health coverage in the next decade.
Over 1.2 million Minnesotans receive health care through Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance in Minnesota, and the congressional cuts would impact people’s health care coverage or their ability to access care. Many of Minnesota’s rural hospitals see a high rate of Medicaid patients, and they could see increased costs through uncompensated care.
Fair Share America rolled a dollar-green bus into Minnehaha Park Tuesday, where advocates and legislators gathered to protest the bill. It was part of the “Stop the Billionaire Giveaway,” a cross-country bus tour with a focus on the bill’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
Several Minnesota legislators and advocates gave speeches to a group of roughly 40 people, who staved off the summer heat with fans shaped like dollar bills.
Jerry Guritz, 72, and John Heidelberger, 72, attended the rally together. Sitting in the front row, they had signs reading “Tax the Rich” and “No Kings.” It was the first action Heidelberger had attended since the early 80s when he protested with the Teamsters.
“We’ve got to quit giving the richest people a free pass. They’ve got to pay their share. That’s where the revenue is going to come from, to aid all of the rest of us. I mean, the billionaires made their money off of the workers. Whichever industry it’s in, they’ve had workers,” Heidelberger said.
Zach Rodvold, public affairs director for Second Harvest Heartland, said that food shelves across Minnesota have seen a vast increase in demand, which will be exacerbated if the bill passes.
“This could affect benefits for as many as 150,000 Minnesotans in the near term through cuts to benefits, or outright stripping people of their benefits altogether,” Rodvold said in a virtual press conference Wednesday. “Over time, it will affect every Minnesota SNAP participant because it makes it harder for benefits to keep up with costs over the next 10 years.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0035-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Amid national controversy over Congress’ “big, beautiful bill,” U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., promised the legislation will bring tax relief to North Dakota residents.
The nearly 1,000-page bill was approved in the Senate on Tuesday. The House now must reconcile the Senate’s version of the legislation with the package it passed in May.
Hoeven and other Republican members of Congress have cheered the bill for its tax cuts, protections for farmers and investment into immigration enforcement and deportations.
Hoeven highlighted that the Senate version of the bill will reduce taxes by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Higher-income Americans and corporations would see the largest tax cuts, though both chambers’ packages also propose tax reductions on tips. 
US House GOP struggles to advance megabill against Freedom Caucus resistance

“These are the fundamentals that make our state stronger,” he said at a Wednesday press conference with Gov. Kelly Armstrong in Bismarck. “Now we’re getting these things implemented at the federal level.”
Critics of the “big, beautiful bill” argue it would push millions of Americans off of Medicaid, undermine other social safety net programs like food stamps and grow the national debt.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in an analysis published Tuesday said the bill would add $3.4 trillion in deficits over the next decade.
Armstrong, a former member of Congress, said he is generally skeptical of the office’s numbers and that its analysis of the bill low-balls the positive effects it would have on the economy.
“I think they drastically, drastically underestimate the impact for North Dakota,” he said.
A Legislative Council analysis of the bill published last week also estimated that it would reduce Medicaid enrollment in North Dakota by roughly 18% within the next 10 years, in part due to proposed changes to eligibility requirements that would force all able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work.
Hoeven said the only people who would lose access to Medicaid under the bill are people who can work but choose not to.
“For all the traditional Medicaid population, nobody loses their Medicaid,” he said.
The reconciliation bill has also caught criticism for proposing changes to SNAP, the nutrition program formerly known as food stamps. The House bill would require states to pay a percentage of food benefit costs for the first time. The Senate proposes only implementing this change for states that can’t get their error payment rates below a certain percentage. Error payment rates measure how accurately states determine who qualifies for SNAP and how much assistance to give them.
Federal funding cuts to North Dakota agencies total $100M so far, analysis shows

Hoeven also said that both chambers’ bills increase the child tax credit, which currently is $2,000 per child. The House proposed increasing the credit to $2,500, while the Senate proposed increasing it to $2,200.
North Dakota’s two other Congressional delegates, Sen. Kevin Cramer and Rep. Julie Fedorchak, also voted in favor of the package.
The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party in a statement earlier this week criticized the package as potentially devastating for people who rely on federal social programs.
“North Dakota taxpayers will be left holding the bag when our elected officials rubber stamp this disastrous bill,” Rep. Zac Ista, House minority leader for the North Dakota Legislature, said in the announcement.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Pennsylvania education leaders are scrambling after the Trump Administration said it would withhold more than $230 million in congressionally approved funding for after-school programs, teacher training, literacy, and education for migrant and non-English speaking students.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Education said the U.S. Department of Education informed officials Monday evening of a delay in the release of funding that was due to be available starting Tuesday. 
The action is separate from the budget reconciliation bill pending final approval in the U.S. House.
Education advocates told the Capital-Star on Wednesday the failure to release the funds was reckless and unlawful and would affect the commonwealth’s most vulnerable students.
“These federal funds support key programs that expand learning for our most underserved students,” Maura McInerney, legal director of the Education Law Center of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said the announcement caught state and local school officials off guard, which came days after the deadline for school districts to approve their budgets.
The uncertainty also arrived as the General Assembly continues negotiations over the state budget.
According to an analysis by Education Week, the $230 million due Pennsylvania is the sixth largest amount among the states after California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. 
Schweyer said he learned of the funding freeze from a school superintendent in his legislative district who had received a “terse” email from the state. He learned further details about the Trump administration’s decision from a New York Times article.
“To say we had no idea this is coming is absolutely accurate,” Schweyer said.
The federal Education Department referred questions to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond.
He said the funding freeze comes as many school districts and partner organizations are working to finalize agreements and hire staff for after school and summer programs. Rural communities where independent nonprofit organizations such as the YMCA and Jewish community centers are less common are likely to be hit harder, he said.
“The Trump administration is beyond reckless. This Congress is beyond impotent. They’re hurting the families we all collectively serve,” Schweyer said.
Funding for seven federal programs totaling nearly $7 billion nationwide is affected. Five of the programs support K-12 schools, while the other two help schools, community colleges and other organizations provide adult literacy and civics education.

McInerney said the programs benefit children affected by poverty through summer school and after-school tutoring and enrichment programs; immigrant students and English learners, children of migrant workers; youth in the foster care system and juvenile justice system; and adults seeking basic education as a pathway to post-secondary education and employment. 
The state Education Department  provided estimates of the impact on commonwealth schools and other organizations that receive the funds:

Title I-C, Migrant Education, $11 million
Title II-A, Supporting Effective Instruction, $70 million
Title III-A, English Language Acquisition, $20 million
Title IV-B, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, $54 million
Adult Education Basic Grants to States, $20 million

“We are assessing the impact of this delay and will keep school leaders and local programs informed. We are also determining any next steps,” department spokesperson Erin James said. “PDE will continue to share updates as they become available and is committed to supporting Pennsylvania schools, educators, and learners throughout this process.”
McInerney said withholding the funds is a violation of the Impoundment Control Act, which regulates how the president can delay or rescind spending that has already been approved by Congress.
“The unilateral withholding of these congressionally appropriated funding streams without any justification or warning to Congress is outrageous and unlawful.  The administration cannot unilaterally delay or cancel appropriations already enacted into law. Only Congress holds this constitutional power,” McInerney said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shauneen-doe-building-exterior_0-1024x7681742509292-1.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, addresses the House of Delegates during a floor session on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan shared more details Wednesday regarding the proof he says he’s collected showing Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, was not responsible for making an antisemitic comment on Instagram last month.
McGeehan — in an interview for WRNR TV — said he personally investigated the accusation against Masters and found the person who he says left the comment from an Instagram account that was using Masters’ full name and that linked to the Citizens Defense League, where Masters once served as president.
The comment in question was left on June 21 by an account with the handle @NoQuarterMasters in response to another comment on a post from April 12 about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. 
In a June 25th interview with West Virginia Watch, Masters denied leaving the comment and said he didn’t have “any active Instagram account.” The next day, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, told MetroNews Talkline that Masters told him the @NoQuarterMasters account used to be his, but he no longer used it. 
According to McGeehan’s radio interview, Masters knew the person who allegedly left the comment through his late brother. When Masters was visiting his hometown in Hancock County “sometime last year,” McGeehan said he ran into the “younger guy” and wanted to help him.
“… [Masters] gave resources to him — gave money, he gave him his old iPhone which didn’t have any cellular service, but you could work it with WiFi or whatever,” McGeehan said.
McGeehan said Masters’ social media accounts, including Instagram, were still logged in on the phone. The person opened them, McGeehan said, and used Masters’ account to leave the antisemitic comment.
“I don’t even think he knew he was on [Masters’] account,” McGeehan said.
McGeehan would not name the individual who he claims made the comment, saying he was “very sick,” “basically homeless” and living with substance use disorder after a recent extended hospital stay where he woke up from an almost two-month-long coma.
“Look, this is a guy that is probably going to eventually die in the near future, either from the disease he has or from overdosing on the narcotics he’s been prescribed to deal with it,” McGeehan said. “… so I’m not getting [him] involved.”
West Virginia Watch left a voicemail for McGeehan on Tuesday afternoon. He responded via text: “Do not contact me.”
When asked by WRNR host Bill Stubblefield if law enforcement should be getting involved as the person who left the comment “hacked” an elected official and impersonated him online, McGeehan laughed.
“Ha. No. This is over as far as I’m concerned,” McGeehan said. “… There’s a lot of things that would go into [an official investigation] and I’m not going to have some sort of witch hunt. I’ve done due diligence.”
Shortly after Masters’ interview with West Virginia Watch last week, the name on the account was changed from “Ian T. Masters” to “I. Masters.” Masters told Hanshaw, according to MetroNews, that he couldn’t access the account and needed tech support from Instagram to change the password. 
The profile picture on the @NoQuarterMasters account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in Chester, West Virginia — where Masters grew up, McGeehan said Wednesday. 
The letter is partially covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. 
McGeehan said the letter in the profile picture was from Masters’ late brother, who died by suicide in 2014. The runes, McGeehan said, were “symbols from Scandinavian Norse mythology” and were meant to be an “homage” to Masters’ brother as the two grew up reading Norse literature.
The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals.

The council, a nonprofit which distributes funds to 52 family planning centers in Missouri and three in Oklahoma, has been operating without key federal funding for three months. It received notice last week that funds were being restored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Wednesday, a letter arrived awarding the organization another year of Title X funding.
The decades-old Title X program funds access to family-planning options, like contraception, cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases. In fiscal year 2024, MFHC received $8.5 million from the program, covering 56,000 patient visits at clinics.
“While we had raised emergency funds to support health centers in providing services, those funds were dwindling,” the nonprofit’s executive director Michelle Trupiano told The Independent. “We and our health centers were about to make some really tough decisions about how to keep doors open and keep services.”
At the end of March, the Trump Administration froze Title X funding to 16 nonprofits in an effort to crack down on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts barred by the President’s executive order. Nearly one in five grantees were impacted. Missouri was one of seven states that, as a result of the suspension, no longer had Title X funds, according to a KFF Health News report.
Trupiano said that the federal government requested information on MFHC and the clinics it helps fund, looking into discrimination policies. MFHC submitted the requested documents and didn’t hear back until the letter of restoration came last week.
“We hadn’t done anything wrong to begin with,” Trupiano said. “Therefore, it’s unclear what we did to correct it because they did not ask us any follow-up questions.”
The Missouri Family Health Council is one of four nonprofits to get funding restored. Others continue to operate without Title X funding or are forced to close doors.
At the end of May, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Ohio stopped operations, citing the loss of Title X funds.
There is an active lawsuit filed by the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the federal government’s withholding of the funds. Missouri Family Health Council is mentioned in the complaint.
Despite the restoration of funds, Trupiano is anxious about the future of Title X, especially given that President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget request includes cutting all Title X family-planning grants.
“We are concerned about what the future holds,” she said. “That is why we are so relieved that this funding was released so that the health centers can provide as much care to as many people as they can for as long as they can.”

“We’ve already had 600 fires start in Washington” this year, Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove said during a press conference Wednesday. Four hundred of those fires were on state-owned land, he added.
“Don’t be an idiot, don’t set our state on fire this weekend, and have a fun, safe Fourth of July,” Upthegrove said. 
Citing data that shows fireworks were responsible for 156 injuries and 271 fires in Washington last year, with the highest concentration of incidents occurring on the Fourth of July, the state fire marshal is encouraging residents to view fireworks at a public display rather than igniting their own. 
For those who do choose to set off their own fireworks, the fire marshal advises them to only use legal, consumer-grade fireworks that don’t show signs of tampering or damage. Officials also warn against pointing fireworks at others or consuming alcohol when handling fireworks. And they advise keeping sparklers and fireworks away from anyone’s body, and having a water source like a bucket or a hose nearby. 
It’s legal to buy or sell fireworks in Washington until 9 p.m. on July 5. 
Under state law, fireworks can only be discharged between noon and 11 p.m. from June 28 through July 5.  
Some counties and cities across Washington have their own fireworks restrictions that supersede state guidelines. 
With much of the state abnormally dry or in drought, counties in eastern and western Washington have also already been imposing burn bans this summer.
As of Wednesday, InciWeb, the federal website that displays wildfire information, showed a roughly 1,900-acre, lightning-sparked fire burning in north-central Washington, mostly in the Glacier Peak Wilderness. It had not led to evacuations and was not threatening any structures.
Fireworks are prohibited year-round on all public lands in Washington, including state parks, beaches and land managed by federal and state agencies. 
After volunteers removed over 129,000 pounds of trash from Washington beaches last Fourth of July weekend, Washington State Parks is asking beach visitors to clean up after themselves and pack out their trash this year. 
To help reduce litter, volunteers with Grassroots Garbage Gang will hand out garbage bags to visitors at the Seaview, Sid Snyder, Bolstad, Cranberry, Klipsan, Ocean Park and Oysterville beach approaches from 4 to 8 p.m. on July 4. 
Washington State Parks and a handful of nonprofits, including Washington CoastSavers, Grassroots Garbage Gang, Surfrider Olympia and Grays Harbor Surfrider, will also host volunteer beach cleanup events along the coast from 9 a.m. to noon on July 5. 
In addition to the year-round fireworks ban, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is restricting several fire-related activities on land it manages in eastern Washington until further notice due to increased wildfire risk.  
Restricted activities include campfires, target shooting, smoking, welding, operating chainsaws, and operating a motor vehicle away from developed roads. 
“This year’s forecast shows an increased risk of wildfires statewide,” Department of Fish and Wildlife Lands Division Manager Kevin Connally said in a statement. “These restrictions help protect local communities, as well as critical wildlife habitat, and we all have a responsibility to our shared outdoor spaces.” 
July 2 marks National Wildland Firefighter Day. Upthegrove and several fire officials took time Wednesday to honor three Idaho firefighters who were shot Sunday in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, while responding to a brush fire, as well as Washington firefighters who died in the line of duty last year. 
“One of the best ways we can honor those that are putting their lives on the line is to do our part to reduce the risk of wildfire, to prevent folks from having to go out and respond in the first place,” Upthegrove said during the press conference, held in Ellensburg. 
Fire season preparation in Washington was made more difficult this year by state budget cuts and federal layoffs, “but we’re ready, at the Department of Natural Resources, thanks to strong partnerships with other agencies,” Upthegrove said. 
“We’re heading into a very, very busy time,” said Kittias Valley Fire and Rescue Chief SJ Goldsmith, citing drought conditions and winds.
“It’s going to take just one spark to create a disaster for our community,” Goldsmith said. “Please make sure that we are taken care of and we don’t have to come put out a fire and risk our lives for your negligence.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fireworks-1024x600.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

The community college announced this week its Senior Companion Program, an Americorps-funded initiative, has paused operation as its funding is being held and reviewed by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Hawkeye Community College Provost Lynn LaGrone said.
Americorps provides funds for programs working with volunteers ages 55 and older to help older adults with special needs live independently and comfortably through the Senior Companion Program. At Hawkeye Community College, LaGrone said the program operates with a $500,000 budget, $400,000 of which comes from Americorps.
College officials, program participants and clients are waiting and hoping the program is deemed valuable enough to the community to get the funding that was already approved by Congress.
“We are such an incredible part of this community that it hurts deeply to not be able to continue to offer a service that benefits some of our most vulnerable constituents,” LaGrone said.

Hawkeye Community College has offered the program since 1976, LaGrone said. Before the halt of operations, 52 senior companions helped 78 clients with what they needed most, whether it be transportation, cleaning or just camaraderie. With other federal grant uncertainty in higher education, she said the college was aware this could happen.
To ensure clients are aware of what’s going on and understand why their companions are no longer stopping by as usual, Executive Director of Public Relations and Marketing Mary Pat Moore said the program head is calling each client personally to “let them know that we’re not abandoning them” and provide advice and resources to try to fill the gap.
Vicky Buss, a second-generation companion who followed in her mother’s footsteps, said she gets paid $4 an hour to meet with three clients multiple times each week. What she does depends on the client’s wishes and needs, she said, but they are always overjoyed to see her stop by and sad to see her go.
“It’s not the money, per se, but it’s just that I feel like these people are people, human beings, and they need the companionship, they need the hugs, they need the caring, you know, and they don’t get that other (than) from us,” Buss said.

This is a program unlike most, LaGrone said, and addresses a growing concern of loneliness becoming a public health crisis. With many of the clients homebound and volunteers all being older adults, the program helps alleviate isolation alongside more practical problems.
“This, to me, adds to part of the crisis, because these were baby steps in the big pool of things, but they were so essential and important to the people who depended on this service,” LaGrone said.
The college has started exploring other funding options in case its federal dollars are permanently lost, but LaGrone said she is remaining “cautiously optimistic” that the funds will be released and the program can continue on like normal. As one of the college’s oldest programs, the community doesn’t want to let it slip away.
Some of the companions are still going out to visit their clients, on their own time and dime, LaGrone said, because of the deep connections and caring the program has facilitated. Buss said she plans to keep seeing at least one of her clients, who has cerebral palsy and always cries when she has to leave.
“I just don’t understand why the government ain’t working with us and helping us out to help them, because in the long run, we’re helping them out, keeping people in their homes,” Buss said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Back in February, South Dakota lawmakers recognized emergency medical services as an “essential service.”
Sort of.
“Essential service” typically means the government has to guarantee access to said service by providing or funding it.
The majority of states don’t affix that designation to ambulance services.
South Dakota lawmakers voted unanimously in favor of a non-binding resolution that says the Legislature “supports efforts to prioritize emergency medical service as an essential public service.”
Grant funds bolster rural ambulances with training, equipment

There were other efforts in Pierre that didn’t get quite so warm a reception.
Two days after the passage of that resolution, lawmakers shot down a bill that would’ve required counties and municipalities to provide ambulance services. Eight days after that, they shot down a similar bill that would’ve created a state fund to divert some money from criminal fines to help pay for services.
Instead of backing those bills, they chartered a committee to study the issue and stocked it with five senators and six representatives. 
On Monday, that group of lawmakers convened in Pierre to talk about long-term survival for the ambulance services now provided by a mix of paid and volunteer response teams across the state. 
The Emergency Medical Services Interim Committee heard testimony on low passage rates for emergency medical technician exams, a decline in volunteerism and the difficulty of setting up an ambulance district, a legal entity.
But one issue loomed over all others.
“The biggest thing I want to get across is that somebody has got to be responsible for funding us,” said Maynard Konechne, director of the South Dakota Emergency Medical Services Association and a presenter during the Monday meeting.
The study group, which reconvenes on July 23, is tasked with producing a report for lawmakers on the sustainability of ambulance services in South Dakota, with a focus on three areas:

Staff recruitment, training and retention.
Access to care in rural areas far from trauma care centers.
Efficiencies in operations.

Citizens expect an ambulance to show up regardless of how far they live from the nearest hospital, said Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, one of the committee’s two leaders. That means the group — and the Legislature as a whole — has to be ready to change the way it thinks about emergency medical services (EMS).
“We have to be willing to have a conversation about how we recognize, support and potentially restructure EMS as an essential part of our public safety system, just like law enforcement or fire services,” said Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, co-chair of the committee.
Rural areas, declining volunteers, low reimbursement rates
The average emergency medical technician in South Dakota is 51 years old, according to survey data collected by the state Department of Health. 
The department regulates and offers technical support to the state’s 121 licensed ambulance services. It also offers training, collects data, and, for the past three years, has been in the process of disbursing $20 million in COVID-era funding to modernize and bolster ambulance services across the state. 
New report recommends state efforts to sustain rural ambulance services

Marty Link, the director of the department’s Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Program, told the committee that South Dakota has 28 active emergency medical technicians (EMTs) between 70 and 75 years old — and two in their 80s.
“They’re doing great work, and I love them dearly,” said Link, himself a longtime service provider, but aging providers are part of the reason the state urged ambulance services to apply for grants to buy “power cots.” The cots lift and push patients into place without the aid of paramedic muscle, which allows older providers to stay on duty a few more years. 
The trouble is that fewer people are signing on to be volunteer technicians, Link said, and more stringent testing requirements have become a hurdle in recent years. 
Just 56% of the South Dakotans who took their paramedic test with the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians passed on the first try this year. EMTs aren’t as highly trained as paramedics, but also must pass a test, often after completing a 190-hour certification course. The passage rate for South Dakota EMT hopefuls in 2025 thus far is 72%.
Paramedic and state Rep. Eric Emery, D-Rosebud, told the committee his first emergency medical course lasted eight hours. Increasing professionalization has meant a more skilled response team, he said, but it’s also put some people off.
Twenty-eight ambulance services in South Dakota are all volunteer. Another 24 have a mix of paid staff and volunteers, and still more are paid per-call.
Training can be ‘“four, five, six months of their life for something that they may not even be compensated for,” Emery said.
Jerome Harvey of Pennington County, a volunteer firefighter, told the committee he doesn’t see the volunteer model as workable long-term.
“The number one issue is steady state funding and realizing the fact that it is a profession,” he said. “We have to recognize that we’re on the other side of the mountain, on the other side of the pyramid, on the downhill slide in terms of volunteerism.”
Recruitment and retention were the number one needs identified in health department surveys of ambulance agencies, part of a 2023 sustainability assessment.
On Monday, Link and Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt trumpeted the department’s “Telemedicine in Motion” program, which has equipped 84% of South Dakota ambulance agencies with tablets that connect to doctors who can advise EMTs on how to best deal with traumatic issues.
Reimbursement troubles
Lemmon, in far northwestern South Dakota, is among the more rural of the state’s rural enclaves. Its nearest hospital is 26 miles away in Hettinger, North Dakota. 
State spends $11.6 million to update equipment for South Dakota ambulance services

Some of Lemmon’s ambulance services are delivered on a pay-per-call basis, but the call cost often outpaces the pay. Medicare covers about $650, Lemmon EMT Association Treasurer Carrie Derschan said, and Medicaid reimbursements pay around $400.
“That’s about 56%,” of the cost to run a patient from the Lemmon nursing home to the nearer hospital.
“We have to write the rest of that off,” she said.
A “Big, Beautiful Bill” packed with President Trump’s policy prescriptions is currently up for debate in Congress. The bill’s provisions have been revised multiple times so far, but Konechne, the EMS Association leader, said he worries that its proposed cuts to Medicaid will exacerbate the issues facing the mobile medical teams.
“We’re struggling the way it is,” said Konechne. “And now we’re going to take another hit. They’re not doing that for police and firefighters.”
Next steps
An increase to the base rate paid by Medicare and Medicaid in South Dakota for ambulance rides is among the funding options listed by the health department in its Monday presentation. Also suggested was funding help for training courses from the state, more investment from local communities for operational needs, and additional fees for “super speeders” or drunken drivers, earmarked to fund medical services.
Community buy-in is already part of the funding puzzle for rural ambulance services. 
Spearfish pitches in $50,000 a year, that city’s EMS director said. In Buffalo, a northwestern city near the Montana border, financial support for the Harding County service’s 2,500-square-mile coverage area comes from local businesses.
“They realize that we are health care,” said Annette Slaba, Harding County’s EMS director.

Emery sponsored one of the bills to require counties and cities to fund ambulance services that failed to earn support back in February. 
His included a plan to siphon some of the money the state collects in criminal fines into an EMS fund, from which localities could pull grants for their operations. It would have started with $1 million from the state general fund, but Emery said during debate on the measure that the fund would probably need $50 million a year to meet the state’s needs.
Committee member Sen. Tamara Grove, R-Lower Brule, said Monday that she feels like citizens wouldn’t balk at paying additional taxes for emergency medical services, as long as they understood where their money was going.
“We want quality people in those ambulances,” Grove said. “We want people who know what they’re doing and are willing to show up at our worst moments.”
Sen. Reed suggested that lawmakers could simplify the process of starting an ambulance district, around 20 of which exist today as multi-county, or multi-community partnerships. If state law makes it too difficult to set up those districts, Reed said, it might make sense to simplify the process to let communities take the lead.
“I don’t think we want the state starting to draw lines,” Reed said. “It’s best for communities to work together and figure this out. A taxing district would be a way of doing that.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/original_978949a6-1724-4a75-b829-cadf69a4b1da_PXL_20221118_164635230-scaled-e1668887227535-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Motorized cots and chairs, emergency medical technician training and life support dummies are among the purchases made by local ambulance services through two rounds of grant awards from the South Dakota Department of Health.
Some of those items came up during the first meeting of the Legislature’s Emergency Medical Services Interim Committee this week in Pierre. That body is studying ways to maintain the viability of the state’s ambulance services, which operate without state funding through a hodgepodge of paid, paid-per-call and volunteer frameworks.
The $7.5 million in grants for local agencies originated with federal COVID relief funding. Former Gov. Kristi Noem asked lawmakers to set aside $20 million of that money in 2022 to bolster local ambulance services.


The money came in three phases. The first $1.7 million was used to fund Telemedicine in Motion, which uses electronic tablets in ambulance vehicles to connect paramedics and other mobile medical providers to doctors who can help guide their responses. 
In the second phase, the state purchased and distributed LIFEPAK 15 patient monitors and defibrillators, along with training for their use, at a cost of $11.6 million.
The third step involved $7.5 million in grants to individual ambulance providers. Those were made available after the completion of a statewide assessment of sustainability for emergency medical services, paid for during the second funding phase. To apply, applicants were required to read the assessment and ask for items that could fill the gaps identified by the report. 
“We said, ‘If you want to apply for a grant, you have to be able to read the study, to read what was done statewide,” Marty Link, the Health Department’s director of emergency medical services, told the committee on Monday. “We didn’t want that just sitting on the shelf.”
Equipment, training purchased through grant awards
Among other things, the sustainability report cited recruitment and retention, an aging volunteer base and funding for equipment as major needs. 
To that end, dozens of local agencies applied for grants to purchase motorized “power cots” and stair chairs, which allow medics to transfer patients without the physical strain.
Fifteen of the 44 grants in round one, awarded in July 2024, included one or more power cots and chairs, distributed across 14 communities. Some of those grants also included money for instructor training, training classes, medical simulation mannequins and software.
Lawmakers look for ways to deliver on support for ‘essential’ ambulance service

Another 18 of the round two grants awarded last November involved the purchase of mobile people-movers.
“With an aging workforce and patients who are getting larger and larger, it helps us get people safely in and out of the house,” said Alan Perry, who heads up the ambulance service in Lennox and is the president of the South Dakota Emergency Medical Services Association.
Perry’s agency bought one power cot and one stair chair with a $45,000 grant, awarded last July. The agency got another $25,200 in the second round to produce a strategic planning report for Lennox, and to buy bright, wearable lights for use by those who respond to incidents on highways at night.
Training was also a focus area. In Spink County, the ambulance service was able to hire two emergency medical technicians and put on a training course for other technician hopefuls. Twelve of the 17 people who qualified to take the national exam passed and were certified, according to the Department of Health’s presentation to lawmakers on Monday.
Grant money for patient transfer database
The largest single grant went to the South Dakota Association of Health Care Organizations for a project that aims to boost efficiencies statewide. 
The group is using its $500,000 grant to set up an interfacility transfer system that it hopes will create “a single portal where neighboring ambulance services can view and select available transfers” by November 2026.
Link pointed to that project during the study committee’s first meeting. 
Ambulances that move patients without emergency needs from one facility to another – like a patient who needs to ride from a nursing home in Chamberlain to an orthopedic hospital in Sioux Falls – can create hazards for their own communities by doing so, he said.
“There’s a lot of concern with ‘How do we maintain that ambulance presence within our local community when we have an ambulance going over the road?” Link said.

As a result, local ambulance services may decline to give the ride or ask that the patient wait for a ride, according to Tim Rave, director of the association. On any given day, Rave told South Dakota Searchlight, there are up to 80 people in the state who are in a hospital that ought to be somewhere else.
That’s the kind of information the association’s collected with its grant funding, Rave said, as it looks to find out how prevalent the issue is. The database the association aims to build would make it easier to alert ambulance services in any given area to patients in need of a ride, Rave said.
In the future, he said, such a database could help ambulances do things like pick up patients from the hospital to which they’ve just delivered a different patient and bring them home.
That would allow a service to “get paid both ways.”
“That’s the sweet spot we’d love to get to, but that feels a little bit like a stretch goal at this point,” Rave said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PXL_20221118_164408441-scaled-e1668887078839-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

Keith Kautz left the high court last year due to the state’s mandatory retirement age. He takes over as Wyoming’s top legal official as state attorneys defend a string of anti-abortion laws in court.
The post Gordon names former Wyoming Supreme Court justice who spoke out against abortion as new attorney general appeared first on WyoFile .","Keith Kautz, a retired Wyoming Supreme Court justice known to carry deep religious convictions against abortions, will become the state’s next attorney general, Gov. Mark Gordon announced Tuesday.
Kautz stepped down from the bench last March, when he turned 70 years old — the legally mandated retirement age for justices in Wyoming’s high court. He is, in essence, swapping positions with Bridget Hill, who served as Wyoming AG until Gordon appointed her in April to fill the supreme court seat left open by the retirement of former Chief Justice Kate Fox earlier this year. 
Fox and Kautz were admirers of each other’s passion for the rule of law, though they often disagreed on judicial decisions, WyoFile reported in a November 2023 piece on Kautz’s retirement. 
Kautz grew up around Huntley, Wyoming, and Lyman, Nebraska, and has a University of Wyoming law degree. Gov. Mike Sullivan first appointed him to the bench in 1993, and Gov. Matt Mead appointed him to the high court in 2015. 
Kautz will become the state’s top law enforcement officer, and its chief litigator, at a time when women’s right to seek an abortion is one of the most pressing issues facing the Wyoming judiciary. Wyomingites have been waiting on the state supreme court to rule on the constitutionality of two bans on abortions passed by the Legislature in 2023. If the justices strike down the total ban, a number of court cases on other abortion restrictions — such as an ultrasound requirement, prohibitions on off-label abortion prescriptions and strict regulations on the state’s lone abortion clinic — will all likely have to be litigated. Kautz would presumably helm the state’s defense of the Legislature’s policies in those cases.
As the state’s top law enforcement officer, Kautz could also play a role in determining how zealously Wyoming enforces whichever restrictions on abortion do survive legal muster.
The former justice made his personal opinions on the matter clear in April, days before his old colleagues held a hearing on the abortion ban. Alongside conservative religious leaders and leaders of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, Kautz participated in a “pray in” ahead of that hearing, leading prayers that the justices would uphold the ban.
“To our great shame, Father, we have decided that an unborn child made in your image isn’t a child at all, but merely an unidentified tissue of potential life that may be destroyed and killed even though we know it is alive,” Kautz said during his prayer remarks. “We are becoming enslaved to unthinkable corruption and immorality and we deserve the consequences of our actions.”
His participation in that event raised eyebrows among some pro-choice advocates. When questioned about it by Wyoming Public Media, Kautz said he had asked Fox not to assign him any cases in his retirement — retired judges in Wyoming will sometimes be called upon to hear a case due to judicial workload or judges having conflicts of interest.
“Because of my interest in this particular issue, abortion, and the right to life and the sanctity of life, I thought it would be better for me and the judiciary for me not to be assigned any cases,” Kautz told WPR.

It’s unlikely a Wyoming attorney general would recuse themselves from defending or enforcing a state law because they personally believed in it, legal observers said. While state officials are governed by conflict-of-interest rules, those apply to financial conflicts or matters involving family members. Michael Pearlman, a spokesperson for Gordon, said he wasn’t able to comment on the question. WyoFile was unable to reach Kautz on Wednesday, when his appointment was announced. 
In a news release announcing his appointment, Gordon praised Kautz’s long tenure in the Wyoming judiciary. When the two men met to discuss the appointment, Kautz quoted George Washington, who said that “due administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good Government,” according to the news release. 
In his 2023 interview with WyoFile, Kautz lamented the divisive rhetoric and polarization in today’s politics.
“It’s unfortunate,” he said. “I don’t think that’s productive. But I’m not willing, in a democracy, to say ‘You can’t have the rhetoric.’”
Gordon’s appointment may be well received by his critics on the right. It comes at a time when some legislators have called for changing Wyoming law to make the attorney general an elected position, as opposed to an appointed one. Last year, the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to make that change with a 6-3 vote. Chamber leadership chose not to consider the measure on the floor, however, killing the bill.

This week marks the 25th anniversary of civil unions, which were the most sweeping grant of rights to gay couples in the nation when they became law on July 1, 2000.
Civil unions grew out of a lawsuit filed by three gay and lesbian couples who had been denied marriage licenses in Vermont. The lawsuit was known as Baker v. Vermont. In December 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled unanimously that gay and lesbian couples were entitled to the same benefits of marriage as heterosexual couples. The court ordered the Vermont legislature to craft a law that would satisfy the ruling, either by legalizing same-sex marriage or by creating an equivalent partnership structure. 
Vermont Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy wrote that the decision, “is simply a recognition of our common humanity.” 
It would take until 2009 for Vermont to legalize same-sex marriage. 
To mark the milestone, I spoke with four of the key participants behind civil unions. Stacy Jolles and Nina Beck were two of the six plaintiffs in Baker v. Vermont. Chief Justice Amestoy wrote the decision. Gov. Howard Dean signed civil unions into law. (Rep. Bill Lippert recounted how the Vermont legislature passed the historic law on The Vermont Conversation in an interview in April.)

THE PLAINTIFFS
I first met Stacy Jolles and Nina Beck in their South Burlington home in 2000 when I covered the civil unions debate for Mother Jones. In my article, I described them cooing over their newborn son. Seth Jolles has since graduated from college and graduate school. Nina and Stacy had a civil union and were married as each of those opportunities became legal.
Stacy, now 67, a psychologist, and Nina, 69, a physical therapist, are now “semi-retired.” They have been familiar faces as the owners of the popular Burlington tea house, Dobra Tea, which they owned for 11 years and sold in 2021. 
Stacy and Nina joined me on the Vermont Conversation in 2015 to talk about the US Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationally, known as the Obergefell decision. 
This week, I asked them how it felt to be marking the 25th anniversary of civil unions.
Stacy Jolles   
I can’t believe it’s been 25 years. That seemed like such a time of great hope and such a different time than it feels right now. So it is nice to go back and remember that times were better but it’s a little scary to realize that we made it 25 years. We may not make it 26.
Nina Beck
It’s an odd juxtaposition to be celebrating something that happened what feels like a very long time ago but really is only the lifetime of our son, and yet wondering what the future holds or if we’re going to lose those rights that we gained.
David Goodman 
You were one of the three couples that were part of this landmark lawsuit. Tell us a little of your personal story as a couple and then what brought you to sue the state of Vermont?
Stacy Jolles   
Stacy prior to our son Seth, who’s 25 now, we had a son, Noah. We were living in North Carolina and we knew at the time that in order to protect me as the non-biological parent, we needed to do a lot of legal paperwork. And so we did that. When Nina was giving birth, we tried to have a home birth but we ended up going to the hospital. And there was another pregnant couple, actually, that went in, and they didn’t ask the gentleman of the couple anything about paperwork, and they literally stopped me at the door and asked for my paperwork and what allowed me to be there. Who was I? Nina was struggling to give birth and Noah was in trouble in utero and I had to come up with the paperwork that allowed me to be there. So for me, that was a very pivotal moment in our lives and it laid the groundwork that marriage is really a legal contract primarily to protect the children. I don’t need the state to sanction my relationship. I don’t need any public validation other than I need legal protection for my kids. So when the opportunity came along, that was what was in my mind.
Nina Beck   
Stacy and I were living in California before we moved to North Carolina and Vermont. In 1992, we had our big Jewish wedding, which was for our friends and family. That was of course not legally meaningful at all. At the time, we’d heard about a lawsuit brought by three couples in Hawaii and they tried to get marriage. They were the first state, and they failed. But that totally put the idea in my mind that this was a fight. This was this was maybe possible. 
We decided together that if we live somewhere where it was possible to be involved in the work for legal civil marriage, that we wanted to do it. That was 1992, and we showed up in Vermont in 1996 in April and found the Vermont Freedom to Marry movement. We said, how can we be involved? We want to do this. 
David Goodman   
Talk about the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force and the marriage equality movement in Vermont that you were part of.
Stacy Jolles   
Well, the movement was really Beth and Susan. 
David Goodman   
This was Beth Robinson, now a federal judge, and Susan Murray, your attorneys at the time.
Stacy Jolles   
Exactly. A lot can be done with just two people who are dedicated. And they were absolutely phenomenal. 
Nina Beck   
It was a very grassroots movement in terms of trying to lift people’s awareness of what is civil marriage (and) why would we want it? Many people traveled all over the state to speak at events to try and gain public support for this. 
David Goodman   
What kind of responses did you get when you were out there tabling and at county fairs?
Stacy Jolles   
Surprisingly we got mostly positive feedback. Both Nina and I were activists our whole lives and we had nothing to lose. It was our obligation since we were both lucky: our families weren’t going to disown us. We weren’t going to lose our jobs. We had so many privileges in so many ways that so many gay and lesbian people didn’t have then and still don’t have. It felt like an obligation to be the person that came forward when so many others couldn’t.
We experienced very little backlash. We got only one letter that was from someone who said they were going to pray for us. And I’m always happy to have somebody pray for me (laughs). 
David Goodman   
I remember being in the Vermont State House when civil unions was being debated in the winter in early 2000. It was intense. There were busloads of people, many from out of state and many with very noticeable southern accents who were from evangelical churches in the South. It felt very volatile. How did it feel to you?
Stacy Jolles   
Well, we’re both martial artists. Not that we were going to get into any kind of physical altercation. 
It was a different time. If I was in that situation now, I would feel very differently. Political violence has become much more normalized. It was moving times, emotional times, but I didn’t feel in danger.
Nina Beck   
I feel like there was a difference between the way Vermont people who lived here reacted to us, even when they didn’t agree with us, as opposed to the people who came up from the south and came from other states. Those people were much more threatening. And also the Vermont folks, even those who were not on our side, didn’t want help. They told those people basically go away. We’re going to keep it local. 
Later when we’d drive through the countryside and see the barns printed with Take Back Vermont, it wasn’t warm and welcoming, but I honestly didn’t feel in danger. 
David Goodman   
The Baker decision was a win for advancing LGBTQ rights, but Stacy, you’ve told me that you felt it was a loss. Explain how it could be both.
Stacy Jolles   
When the decision came down and the (Vermont) Supreme Court basically punted (same-sex partnership) to the legislature, I felt like we lost. The Supreme Court did not rule for marriage. Intellectually, I recognize that you take two steps forward, one step back. I get that it was progress, but I felt like we lost. I felt like the Supreme Court said, No, we’re not going to give you marriage. (Civil unions) wasn’t going to protect my kids in the way I needed them protected. At the time I was working full time and staying home with Seth, and it wasn’t going to protect his rights with the over 2000 federal advantages from marriage. 
Nina Beck  
We live on Lake Champlain, and if we traveled across that lake to New York State, our civil union wouldn’t necessarily be recognized there. What if we went across the lake for the day and got in trouble and needed medical care? There were many, many important protections that marriage has, that civil unions left out. It was separate but unequal.
David Goodman   
It took another decade for Vermont to pass same-sex marriage in 2009 over the veto of Governor Jim Douglas. How did that feel?
Stacy Jolles   
That was awesome. That felt like a step in the right direction towards federal marriage being legal in all states. That was uplifting. 
David Goodman   
Did you get a civil union and then get married? 
Nina Beck   
Yes, we had a civil union ceremony, which included our local representative coming to our house, acting as Justice of the Peace, sitting in our living room and signing a piece of paper. We were not very excited about it, but we wanted it legally in place. When we won marriage, we had a great party in the boathouse at the Burlington waterfront. We recreated our big Jewish wedding, and Beth (Robinson) officiated. That was a great party. 
David Goodman   
Twenty-five years after civil unions in Vermont, there is intense blowback against LGBTQ rights. The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled against LGBTQ rights in several cases, allowing parents to opt-out their children from school classes that include LGBTQ-themed books, and banning gender-affirming health care for transgender youth. How fearful are you that the rights that you won could be undone?
Stacy Jolles   
I think they will be undone. 
I am the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, as is Nina. So we were raised to view governments like the one we’re experiencing now in a very different way than most Americans might view it. I think it’s going to get very bad and I’m just going to be active until the very last minute. I can be active trying to protect young LGBTQ people’s rights, particularly young transgender people. And I think we’re going to have to fight harder than we have before. 
Nina Beck   
Not to make too many parallels, but the Jews of Europe became extremely assimilated, particularly Austria and Germany, and kind of forgot that antisemitism was real. And there’s a way in which I think young people today who have grown up in the last 25 years without knowledge of homophobia in the way that we who grew up in the 60s and 70s felt it. So it’s a shock to them. It’s not surprising to me, but it is scary in a way that we haven’t seen in a long time.
Every day some more rights are lost. I don’t want to go back to living that way, but I know how to and we’ll just keep fighting. We’ll just have to keep fighting and not be shocked and horrified that these things are going away but rather activated by it.
David Goodman   
You both lived through a time when it seemed impossible that same-sex marriage could win. In 1996, President Clinton passed the Defense of Marriage Act. The tide was not in your favor in the late 1990s. What is your advice to the next generation of activists about what’s needed to prevail even at a time like this?
Stacy Jolles   
We have to be vigilant and brave and as out there as we possibly can. It’s going to get really bad, it’s going to get really scary, and we still are going to have to stand up and fight.
Nina Beck
Don’t back down. 
We have to be as strong as humanly possible. We can look to AIDS activists for tactics. We can look to the civil rights workers for tactics. There’s so many organizations that have gone before us. We just have to adopt the tactics of our predecessors and do it again.
David Goodman   
Any last thoughts? 
Nina Beck   
We continue to feel very privileged to live in the great state of Vermont where we do have rights and privileges as gay and lesbian people. Vermont is the only state that has no laws pending or on the books against trans people. That’s remarkable. We are very lucky to be here.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
Jeffrey Amestoy served as attorney general of Vermont from 1985 to 1997, winning seven elections, five of them as the nominee of both the Republican and Democratic parties. In 1997, Governor Howard Dean appointed Amestoy to be Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Two years later, he wrote the Baker decision. Amestoy retired as chief justice in 2004 and later was a fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.
Amestoy, 78, spoke with me at his home in Waterbury Center with a stunning view of Mount Mansfield. I asked him what led him to write the most famous line from the Baker decision, that legalizing same-sex partnerships was “simply a recognition of our common humanity.”
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I was cognizant of the extent to which a pure legal analysis that dictated a result to the people of Vermont on an issue that divided them was something to be concerned about. I thought if we could frame the issue in terms that folks would respond to, they would begin to see what it meant in terms of the rights involved. So the phrase “common humanity” was one that I had hoped would resonate. I think it helped structure the public debate, because it became not a question of whether a special class should get special treatment, but I think it helped promote a dialog in which people spoke of their own personal experiences and related it to common humanity. 
The structure of the legal analysis was based on the common benefits clause. So it became a mechanism to try to encourage a public dialog that spoke to the heart of the matter, which was really human relationships. 
David Goodman   
How aware were you that your decision would have national implications and thrust Vermont into the middle of a national culture war?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I was aware of the significance of the issue to a substantial portion of the country. Folks had fought long and hard, like Beth Robinson and Susan Murray and other advocates for same-sex recognition. You couldn’t be ignorant of the extent to which it had been turned into a real divisive political issue. The Defense of Marriage Act was signed into law by President Clinton in 1996 — that’s three years before our opinion. The (U.S.) Senate passed (DOMA), 85 to 14. Senator Leahy and Senator Jeffords both voted for it. That law said that marriage was between a man and a woman, and beyond that, no state was required to recognize another state’s same-sex marriage. That framed the political culture. It was a reminder to me that any decision that Vermont came up with was going to precipitate a national debate.
David Goodman   
You also knew that other state courts had waded into this terrain. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 1993 and Anchorage (Alaska) Superior Court in 1998 had both legalized same-sex marriage, only to have voters in those states pass constitutional amendments that reversed the decision. How did that affect you as you approached the Baker decision, knowing that you could spark a backlash that could result in this being a very short lived decision?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It was fundamental to my perception of how we ought to weigh the consequences of the decision if our rationale was trying to advance equal rights for same-sex couples. To me, one of the paramount determinations to be made was how likely was a decision of the court going to advance that? Would a same-sex marriage decision directed from the court advance that? Based on the experiences of Alaska and Hawaii, (legalizing same-sex marriage) would have certainly precipitated a constitutional amendment in Vermont that would have found a lot of public support that would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman. That would have cut off the ability for a court to deal with the matter if the Vermont State Constitution was amended. 
In terms of the climate of the time, between the decision of our court in December 1999 and the civil unions passage in April 2000, voters in California, a liberal state, passed (Proposition 22), a referendum that defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. That passed 61 to 39 percent. That was an indicator of the extent to which there wasn’t going to be a straight line from a Supreme Court decision, even from Vermont, that was going to then lead directly to the recognition of same-sex marriage legally in this country. So all those were part of my framing of the issue.
David Goodman   
You’re describing a very hostile national climate regarding same-sex marriage. What persuaded you to go a different way?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
We tried to look at the issue of the claim for same-sex marriage rights in the context of the Vermont constitution. You had a culture and a history of Vermont in terms of the creation of the common benefits clause. What persuaded me was a legal analysis that we could draw from Vermont’s constitutional culture and one I think that was consistent with Vermont values. So from that standpoint, beyond whatever our personal consideration about the issue was, the claim for same-sex marriage benefits in Vermont resonated with our constitutional framework. Our decision attempted to advance that in a way that would lead to what it did lead to, which was eventually an embrace of same-sex marriage by Vermonters.
David Goodman   
The Baker decision legalized either marriage or an equivalent partnership structure. It took another 10 years before marriage passed over the veto of Governor Jim Douglas. Why didn’t you just legalize same-sex marriage in 1999?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I thought it would precipitate a constitutional amendment in Vermont, as was being done in 36 other states and was being done in California, that would compel states through their own state constitutions that would foreclose courts from deciding the issue. The constitutional amendments in each state would have provisions that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. 
The response even to the civil union decision indicated how difficult it would have been in that climate in that time to have even Vermonters abide by that decision in the Supreme Court. If you look at the surveys at the time, Vermonters were not embracing the idea of same-sex marriage, and they were not embracing the idea of civil unions either. So it became a much more difficult task for the legislature. Not that what we’d done was an easy thing to do, but the difficult and hard work (that) we honor 25 years later was the work of the Vermont legislature and, of course, Vermonters themselves.
David Goodman   
What does this 25 year milestone mean to you?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It makes me proud of Vermont. I’m from Vermont. It was a testament to my own faith in the judgment of Vermonters. What Vermonters should be proud of is that it advanced the extraordinary significance of same-sex marriage in this country in a way that I think would have taken longer and perhaps had a more difficult route. Vermonters, as I’d hoped they would, rose to the occasion, as they’ve done historically in a number of other areas too. 
David Goodman   
What did you feel when the U.S. Supreme Court passed the Obergefell decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It came much sooner than I thought. At the time of Baker, if someone had asked me would the U.S. Supreme Court reach a decision legalizing same-sex marriage in my lifetime, I would have said no. I go again to the point of how a constructive, realistic approach to moving public discourse that recognizes common humanity probably moved that to a much quicker decision by the United States Supreme Court than I would have thought possible. That was a testament to what we had done in Vermont.
THE GOVERNOR
Howard Dean, 76, became governor in 1991 on the death in office of Governor Richard Snelling. Dean was subsequently elected to five two-year terms, becoming the longest serving governor in Vermont history. 
David Goodman   
How did you feel about same-sex marriage in the mid to late 1990s? Democrats nationally were not particularly supportive.
Gov. Howard Dean   
President Clinton wasn’t supportive because he was a great politician and could read the polls. I was not a great champion at the time. I remember exactly where I was when the (Baker) court decision came down. I was in Burlington at a meeting on education, and somebody threw a microphone in front of my face and said, What do you think of this? And my response was a great dismay to people who later became very close friends (like Rep.) Bill Lippert. 
I said, “Well, it makes me uncomfortable, same as everybody else.” And I was uncomfortable.  
I grew up in the 60s and when I was in high school, it was unthinkable to say who you were if you were gay. There was plenty of homophobia. I grew up in a different era. I came to change my mind as governor, because it was actually quite simple. The same-sex marriage people basically outlined about 1700 rights that you could have if you were a married heterosexual person that you could not have if you were in a gay partnership. And as soon as that happened, I realized this was a civil rights bill. It wasn’t just about marriage, (it was) about equality under the law. There was a whole population of Americans that was discriminated against and so something had to be done about it. But I was somebody who had to be brought along because of my upbringing and because of the generation I come from.
David Goodman   
It’s helpful for people to understand where things were in the 1990s. Even for a Democratic governor like yourself, this was not a simple issue. 
Gov. Howard Dean   
Yeah, it was complicated. But once it got distilled to the civil rights issue, that was easy. And then (Reps.) Tom Little and Bill Lippert, who were respectively the chairman and vice chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House, came to me and said, Look, we can’t get marriage out of our committee, so we’re going to call it civil unions. And essentially, they said a civil union is going to be marriage by another name. And so I said, Look, you guys are the ones on the firing line. You have to do it. And of course, Bill (Lippert), because he was gay, if he was advising this course, then that was sort of the gold standard. And then it went to the Senate. It passed. And that was brutal. In the House, absolutely brutal. 
The (House speech) I remember the most was (Rep.) John Edwards, who was this former state trooper from a very conservative part of the state, which is Franklin County. And he gave up his seat. There was (Rep.) Marion Milne. She gave up her seat. She got up and said she was from Barre and didn’t like this. And she said basically, this is the right thing to do. She didn’t flinch. 
David Goodman   
Unlike anyone else involved in this issue, you had to run statewide after passing civil unions in 2000. This was the heyday of the Take Back Vermont movement, which really sprung up in response to civil unions being passed. You won re-election in 2000 with 50.5% of the vote, barely enough to keep it out of the legislature…
Gov. Howard Dean   
…Which was a Republican legislature after all was said and done because of civil unions. 
David Goodman   
Many legislators who supported civil unions were defeated in November 2000. So there was a political price to pay. What impact did you think civil unions would have on your political future? 
Gov. Howard Dean   
I hate to say this, and nobody’s going to believe it, but I didn’t care. 
This is where the problem with most politicians is. If an issue like this comes along and you conclude that it’s a matter of civil rights, and you duck it for the convenience of your election, you’re wasting your time in politics. Which, of course, is what the problem in Congress is today. I’d say 100% of the Republicans and a good portion of the Democrats are wasting their time because they shouldn’t be in politics. If you’re not willing to stand up for something, why are you in the business? And so for me, it was easy. 
David Goodman   
You signed civil unions into law in 2000 and it took nine years, and over the veto of your successor, Governor Douglas, for same-sex marriage to be legalized in Vermont. Do you have any second thoughts that perhaps just legalizing gay marriage in 2000 would have been the better move?
Gov. Howard Dean   
We couldn’t possibly get it through the legislature. If Bill Lippert comes to me and says, I can’t get this through the legislature, and Tom Little – (a Republican) who in all states other than this one would be a Democrat — if those two people come to me and say they can’t get the bill through…
In politics, sometimes you have to take half and come back and get the other half later. What we did was the first marriage equivalent bill in the entire United States of America. And I think if we hadn’t done what we did, that would have set the cause back for years. We were the model. Even though it wasn’t full marriage — but it basically was as the two described it in the privacy of my office, this is marriage in everything but name — and that’s what it was.
David Goodman   
What do you think was the national significance of Vermont’s civil unions bill?
Gov. Howard Dean   
I think people saw it as gay marriage. It was sort of the lead issue. It happened. I think the next state that did it was Massachusetts, and they did it by court order.
David Goodman   
Today we see a backlash against LGBTQ issues, with the US Supreme Court and Congress limiting rights. Do you think this is a backlash that began right after you signed that law?
Gov. Howard Dean   
This is an organized conservative attempt to overthrow rights which the vast majority of American people support. This (U.S. Supreme) Court essentially is bought and paid for. The court system in this country is a disaster and thank God it wasn’t like that when all this stuff was going on. 
David Goodman   
In the long arc of your political career, where do you rank civil unions among the things that you’ve accomplished? 
Gov. Howard Dean   
I think the only thing that was more important was getting the waiver from the Clinton administration to insure all kids under 300% of poverty. Virtually every child in the state has health insurance, and that’s been going on since 1992. So that one I’d have to put first, but I’d put civil unions second. 
In terms of personal challenges, civil unions was by far the first, because I didn’t really for sure understand what it was to be a public servant until you have to make a decision like that, where you know the public is going to be really upset. I didn’t know I had it in me to do what was right instead of what was politically expedient. 
I never regretted. I had to wear a bulletproof vest all summer during my campaign because the threats were so awful, not just in state, mostly out of state, and all the parades I had to go to, and the meetings that I went to, and tremendous amount of money spent by the Vermont taxpayers on making sure that nobody could take a shot at me. But it never crossed my mind.
Why are you in politics if you don’t stand up for anything that needs to be stood up for?

""When Aiden Became a Brother"" can be seen in the front. Pierce County LibraryA Pierce County librarian is out of a job because of what she calls political pressure over a book about a transgender child that was part of a display in the library.
Former Pierce County Library Manager Lavonnia Moore doesn’t have a degree in library science but worked her way to the top over 15 years, starting as a part-time clerk.
That came to an end on June 18 when she says she was called into the office to speak with Three Rivers Library System Director Jeremy Snell, who told her she was being let go over a book that was part of a summer reading display. Moore said the book, titled “When Aidan Became a Brother” by Kyle Lukoff, was selected for the display by a child at the library.
Moore said she did not have a history of disciplinary problems or bad performance reviews.
Snell did not respond to a voicemail or emailed requests for comment. Snell told the Blackshear Times that the display of the book was the reason for the decision.
Moore said she has hired an attorney.
“It was a shock. I was shocked. I said ‘OK.’ And I broke down. In my mind, I was thinking to myself, ‘I was not going to tell a child no,’” she said.
Moore said the beginning of the end came near the start of June when she allowed parents and kids to create a display to match the theme of the Georgia Public Library Service’s summer reading program, “color our world.”
“There were books, DVDs, games, and each and every one of them had at least a hint of a rainbow on it,” she said. “Because all the kids went to find rainbows. I was just happy that the kids knew where the books were. They even took the time to go into the card catalog to find books. I’m like, ‘Oh! They used the library properly! They know how to use the library!”
“One kid put a box of crayons on the display,” she added. “I’m like ‘Dude, that’s awesome,’ and he’s like ‘I know, right?”
Moore said one of the children brought the book “When Aidan Became a Brother.” Moore said she didn’t know it at the time, but the book is about a young transgender boy whose family is expecting a new baby.

The book is written for young children and discusses Aidan’s gender identity not matching his sex at birth. It doesn’t contain anything graphic or explicit. The cover shows Aidan with his family wearing a shirt with a rainbow on it.
“All I saw was Aidan becoming a big brother,” Moore said. “I saw a family with a kid wearing a rainbow sweater and the mom pregnant. It was a mixed family. I was like, ‘OK, sure, put it on the table.’”
But the book’s placement didn’t sit well with a group called Alliance for Faith and Freedom, which made posts on social media calling on followers to write in to library staff and Pierce County commissioners.
“Please PRAY and take just a few minutes right now to email the (Three Rivers Regional Library) staff and Pierce Commissioners to encourage them to put a stop to this and show them the community supports them in taking a stand against promoting transgenderism at our local library,” the group wrote in posts on Facebook and Instagram.
The group’s Instagram post had no visible likes, comments or shares, while the Facebook post had 26 reactions, ten comments and 82 shares.
Alliance for Faith and Freedom did not respond to a request for comment.
Moore said she had no intention to promote any ideology but kept books relevant to all kinds of people in the community, including LGBTQ people, immigrants from different countries and people who speak various languages.
“The library is for everybody,” she said. “You should be able to go into any library and feel welcome or at least find something that you will enjoy reading, doing, or any resources. I know this day in time is tough, believe me, it is real tough, but the library should be one place that should not be a hurdle.”
Moore said the group has targeted her before over similar issues.
According to the Blackshear Times, the Pierce County Library left the Okefenokee Regional Library System last year, joining the Three Rivers System last July “over controversies surrounding certain sexual displays and bathroom policies.”
‘The fundamental mission of every library’
Organizations like Alliance for Faith and Freedom target libraries across the country, said Todd Cates, a library media specialist in Georgia and the recent winner of the Georgia Library Media Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award.
“They seem to be interested in removing books only that discuss LGBTQ issues or issues of people of color,” he said. “They latch onto a book based on the cover, based on the title, based on the topic. They generally don’t have any real reason to attack the book other than it talks about people of color or LGBTQ topics. They raise a stink, and politicians respond to stink.”
Cates said libraries have procedures for patrons to challenge books and he was disappointed to hear that Moore was fired.
He said “When Aidan Became a Brother” was appropriate for the library’s shelves and the display.
“That’s the fundamental mission of every library. We represent all members of our community, no matter their race, their creed, their religion, their gender, their sexual identity, their sexuality, where they’re from. My library here at my school, I have books in Spanish, I have books in Korean. I represent everybody. I have several copies of the Bible on my shelf. There’s several copies of books that would probably be considered controversial by other groups of people, but that’s immaterial because it represents the people that I serve.”
Georgia mom Lena Kotler said she’s happy when her 10-year-old transgender child Aleix can see herself reflected in the books she reads or the shows she watches.
“I want my child to see people like her, but see them living joyfully and with an in-depth life,” the Decatur mom said. “I’m a millennial. The rare times we saw anything mentioned about someone being trans or in some way gender nonconforming, it was a punchline, it was a plot twist, it was this negative thing, and I want my children to see people like them growing up to be adults who are happy and joyful and have the full life experience, the spectrum of life experience.”
But while inclusion is important, the writing still has to be good, Aleix says, and sometimes transgender characters are written as one-dimensional with their whole plot revolving around being trans.
Aleix’ recommendations for kids’ media that get LGBTQ representation right include the 2022 Disney film “Strange World” and “DeadEndia,” a webcomic and graphic novel with an animated adaptation.

(Courtesy of Lake County School District)Colorado school districts are scrambling after the Trump administration put on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools across the country, including an estimated $70 million earmarked for the state. 
The U.S. Department of Education is withholding certain grants for after-school programs, teacher training, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives. States were notified Monday, a day before they would typically receive the money. 
This pause has left districts across Colorado uncertain about programs they were already committed to offering. Colorado Education Commissioner Susana Córdova sent a letter to schools about the withheld grants, saying she is “deeply concerned about the potential impact of the delay and ongoing uncertainty surrounding these critical funds.”
The federal Department of Education has not provided a timeline on the funds, which it said are under review in a notice to states. The funds were already approved by Congress.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the notice said.
Gov. Jared Polis called the move a “direct attack on children, families and Colorado educators” in a statement Wednesday.
“This funding for our schools is already obligated, and it’s absurd that the federal government withheld it,” Polis said. “Investing in education and ensuring that Colorado children have the best possible future has been a top priority, and it’s disappointing to see the federal government hurt students and teachers.”
Programs in limbo
The paused grants make up two-thirds of the after-school program budget for the Lake County School District, which is nestled in the mountains of central Colorado at a 10,000-foot elevation. 
Half of the students enrolled in the small district qualify for subsidized school lunches, and most of their parents drive hours to get to their jobs in high-end resort towns. These parental commutes are why the district’s after-school programs — which provide kids with tutoring, healthy snacks and even occasional bagpipe lessons — are “essential child care,” Superintendent Kate Bartlett said. 
Without the federal grants totaling about $400,000 the district expected to receive, Bartlett said most or all of the after-school programming would shut down, forcing some parents to cut hours at work.
“It’s not just losing out on Lego robotics,” Bartlett said. “The downstream impact is actually much deeper. So that is what makes me sad and worried, not just about outcomes for kids, but really outcomes for families and outcomes for our regional economy.”
The Trump administration’s decision has hit other districts across the state hard as well. Denver Public Schools stands to lose at least $10 million if the grants aren’t disbursed, according to district spokesperson Scott Pribble. That could push the district, which is the largest in the state, to make cuts to staffing, programs and services, he said.
Alex Marrero, superintendent of Denver Public Schools, and Carrie Olson, president of the district’s Board of Education, issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon to “demand the immediate release of these funds.”
“This action is not just a logistical crisis — it is a moral and constitutional breach,” the statement said. “The decision to delay the distribution of congressionally-appropriated education funds is a dangerous overreach of executive authority and a direct affront to public education, especially for communities that rely most heavily on these supports.”
Colorado Education Association President Kevin Vick said in a Wednesday interview that the teachers union is seeking “every available avenue” to get the funding restored.
“Most of this funding is earmarked for our most vulnerable students in our most vulnerable districts, and so as these districts are making plans for the upcoming school year, they were relying on these funds to be able to put needed programs in place,” Vick said. “These funds need to be delivered to Colorado as promised.”
School-based mental health care
In a decision earlier this year, the Trump administration canceled about $1 billion in Department of Education grants that focus on addressing student mental health. Those grants come from a different pot of money than the funding paused this week.
On Tuesday, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser announced that he was joining 15 other state attorneys general in a lawsuit to restore the mental health grants, calling their cancellation illegal and vague. Nearly $10 million is at stake for Colorado institutions, including the University of Colorado, University of Northern Colorado, University of Denver and Colorado Department of Education. 
The funding was meant to “address a shortage of school-based mental health care professionals through recruitment, retraining and re-specializing clinical workers for school-based roles,” according to a statement from Weiser. 
“This illegal action by the U.S. Department of Education to rip away critical funding couldn’t be happening at a worse time,” Weiser said.  “Colorado is taking action because our educational leaders need every tool possible to support kids who are struggling with disconnectedness, loneliness and isolation.”
The lawsuit was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LCIS-Students-Initiative-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)Hundreds of immigrants awaiting deportation will arrive Wednesday night at the detention center the state built in the Everglades, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced on X.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office told reporters Wednesday morning that the timing for arrival of detainees depended on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The operations at the Everglades Center that Uthmeier and Gov. Ron DeSantis have referred to as a “one-stop shop” for deportations are starting a day after President Donald Trump visited and urged other states to build similar sites.
Uthmeier didn’t offer specifics of the number of people set to arrive at the site at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport or where they are coming from. DHS and Uthmeier’s office didn’t immediately respond to questions from Florida Phoenix.
“Alligator Alcatraz will be checking in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens tonight,” Uthmeier wrote, using Florida officials’ name for the site. “Next stop: back to where they came from.”
Trump says he wants other states to build migrant detention centers after Everglades tour

During his Tuesday visit, Trump said the center would house “some of the most vicious people on the planet.” Around 71% of immigrants detained have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
But while immigrants in the country without authorization start to arrive at the Everglades tent and trailer center, which has a capacity of 3,000 people, the DeSantis administration is already moving to open another 2,000-person detention center in Camp Blanding, the primary training center for the Florida National Guard.
Ahead of the start of operations, water seeped into a tent and created large puddles following a storm, where state and federal officials had posed for pictures and Gov. Ron DeSantis answered questions from the press on Tuesday. Stephanie Hartman, a spokesperson from the Florida Division of Emergency Management, and DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, said the seams that allowed the water to come in had been fixed overnight.
Griffin also told reporters Wednesday morning that FDEM would be in charge of the facility with oversight from DHS.
Meanwhile, Democrats in the state Legislature and Congress sent letters to Uthmeier and DeSantis condemning the operation and demanding answers about the governor’s speedy takeover of the land owned by Miami-Dade County using authority under a state of emergency on illegal immigration he first declared in 2023.
Florida’s Democratic Congressional delegation expressed its concerns about environmental damage and the treatment of immigrants, who will sleep in bunk beds inside tents with A/C during the rising summer temperatures.
“We urge you to immediately reverse course, halt construction activity, and fully withdraw the proposal to establish any detention facility at the Dade-Collier site,” the Democrats wrote. “We further request that you commit to transparent and science-based environmental review process for any future development plans affecting the Everglades region.”
Environmental groups are waiting for a response from a federal judge out of the Southern District of Florida on their request to temporarily halt the Everglades detention center. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit Friday, arguing that the hasty, eight-day construction at the site violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), requiring public input and analysis of potential harms before construction.

Andre Bauer has launched a bid to unseat four-term U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026, saying he’s the “real MAGA” alternative for fed-up GOP voters.
Bauer, who left elected office in 2011 after losing a bid for governor, announced his candidacy Wednesday, The Associated Press first reported.
The 56-year-old former legislator and two-term lieutenant governor says he’s the true conservative who will fight to rein in federal spending and oppose sending troops and taxpayers’ money to fight wars overseas.
Calling South Carolina’s senior senator a “war monger and globalist,” Bauer told the SC Daily Gazette it doesn’t matter that Graham already has President Donald Trump’s endorsement for a fifth term.
“I am the real Trump guy. I’ve stuck with him the whole time,” Bauer said, noting Graham’s sometimes rocky relationship with the president over the last decade.

“He’s not MAGA,” Bauer said, referring to Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan and dubbing Graham as “liberal Lindsey.”
In response, Graham’s campaign stressed that Trump gave his “complete and total endorsement” to the incumbent senator. And just this week, the Senate Budget Committee chairman helped push Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” through the Senate to deliver the president’s “America First” agenda, said Graham campaign spokesperson Abby Zilch.
As for who’s MAGA, she recrafted the slogan for Bauer’s campaign: “This is all about Making Andre Great Again.”
Also this week, Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, signed on to Graham’s campaign staff, telling reporters “President Trump has made it clear that he wants Sen. Graham by his side to keep delivering results, and I’m proud to do my part to ensure that happens.”
LaCivita also has prior ties to Bauer, having run his unsuccessful 2010 campaign for governor.
Graham’s team
Graham, who launched his re-election bid in February, has a history of attracting — and besting — challengers from his right flank.
In 2014, he fended off six Republican opponents without needing a runoff. In 2020, he easily defeated three GOP challengers to his right before taking on Democrat Jaime Harrison, who lost by double digits in what was then the most expensive U.S. Senate race ever.
Beyond getting Trump’s endorsement for 2026, Graham’s re-election co-chairs are Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott. And a long list of GOP heavyweights helping him raise money include David Wilkins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada and House speaker; former state GOP Chair Karen Floyd; and Ed McMullen, Trump’s former ambassador to Switzerland.
Still, Graham could face a tougher contest in a smaller GOP primary field.
Trump’s backing doesn’t guarantee the party faithful will support him, as seen at a Trump campaign event in Pickens on Independence Day two years ago, when the crowd booed Graham off the stage on his home turf. The Upstate event wasn’t far from his hometown of Seneca.
“You can bet Bauer heard that boo,” former SC GOP Chairman Katon Dawson told the SC Daily Gazette.
Dawson, whose tenure spanned campaigns by both Graham and Bauer, called both men “talented politicians” but said he expects Graham to be able to shake off many of the criticisms thrown his way.
“He can piss off one wing of the party, but that won’t be all of them,” Dawson said.
Time in office
Greenville businessman Mark Lynch, owner of Jeff Lynch Appliance Center, launched his campaign to oust Graham in February. After putting $5 million of his own money into the campaign, he’s already running TV ads to boost his profile.

Bauer, who lives in Travelers Rest, has name recognition from his time in office, starting with his election to the state House in 1996 at age 27 representing a Lexington County district. Three years later, he won a special election for a state Senate seat spanning four counties before being elected lieutenant governor in 2002 at age 33. At the time, he was the youngest lieutenant governor in the country.
Still, it has been 13 years since Bauer has run for office and 19 years since he’s won.
Voters who have moved into the fast-growing state since then won’t know him.
Dawson said he saw it firsthand at a Nikki Haley campaign event during her failed presidential bid last year. Inside a crowded room in Beaufort, he said she asked the crowd how many knew her during her time as governor. Only about a quarter of the room raised their hands.
“There are lots of new voters up for grabs,” said Dawson, chairman from 2002 to 2009. “I’ve seen them; they’re out there. And they’re all along the coast.”
Bauer’s last campaign was in 2012 for the state’s then-new 7th Congressional District, when he a lost a runoff to eventual U.S. Rep. Tom Rice. In 2010, he placed last in a four-way GOP primary ultimately won in a runoff by Haley, who went on to win the Governor’s Mansion that November.
In the interim, Bauer’s gotten married and become a father to four children ages 5 to 17. Having children changed his entire perspective, he said: “There’s a lot of growth from 40 to 56.”

“I think it’s a good break,” Dawson said of Bauer’s time away from office. “He’s still young.”
Still, the former GOP chairman was surprised to see Bauer taking on an entrenched U.S. senator with what Bauer estimates to be $70 million-plus in fundraising capacity. Graham currently has nearly $16 million on hand, according to the latest campaign filings.
Bauer said he recognizes the money disadvantage.
“This is fighting an Army with a toothpick,” he said. “When you’re part of the system, you’re going to raise a lot of money.”
But the former marathoner, who’s known to walk hundreds of miles over a campaign, plans to out-work Graham to convince voters “what true MAGA is.”
“I wouldn’t want to run against Andre Bauer,” Dawson said. “I think Andre’s asset is Andre. He’ll hang off bridges with signs if he has to.”
Graham’s advantages
But Dawson pointed to South Carolina’s history of re-electing long-time, incumbent senators of both parties.
Graham was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002 to replace retiring GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond, who left office after turning 100 and died six months later. U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings, who remained a Democrat over his four-decade tenure as he fought for balanced budgets, retired in 2004. He died in 2019 at age 97.
Dawson noted neither was voted out. And he said he’d be surprised if Graham doesn’t hold on to his seat. He considers Graham’s hawkish stances on foreign policy, to include his continued staunch support of Israel and approval of Trump’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, to be a strength in this military friendly state.
“He’s got a lot of friends and he’s done a lot of favors,” Dawson said. “If anything, South Carolina likes a career politician who knows how to bring the bacon home. And Sen. Graham certainly does that.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9754-e1751497833645-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

The Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee on Monday and Tuesday heard from the elected district attorneys from Santa Fe and Las Cruces, both of whom are critical of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s “case management order,” which sets deadlines for prosecutors to disclose evidence and schedule pretrial witness interviews.
The special rule, which first went into effect in Albuquerque-area courts in February 2015, is meant to resolve criminal cases without unneeded delays and reduce case backlogs by establishing deadlines for steps leading to trial.
At present, the rule applies only in the Second Judicial District in New Mexico’s most populous county of Bernalillo; the Third Judicial District, in the second most populous county of Doña Ana; and the Eighth Judicial District, which covers Union, Colfax and Taos counties.
First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, whose district covers Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Los Alamos counties in Northern New Mexico, told the committee on Monday afternoon she expects the case management order will come to her area in January 2026.
She has been in talks with First Judicial District Court Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid about the process of adopting the special rule since the fall of 2023, according to a letter her office shared with Source NM. In that letter, she wrote that Biedscheid hasn’t given her, police or public defenders the opportunity to plan and prepare for the rule.
Under the rules in Bernalillo, Doña Ana and the Eighth Judicial District, the simplest cases must go to trial within about seven months and the most complex ones, including murder cases, must go to trial within approximately 15 months.
The rules require more complex cases to go to trial within a year if the person is held in jail, unless the defendant agrees to a longer period or uncontrollable circumstances occur. The rule also shortens deadlines for prosecutors to make evidence available to defense attorneys.
The same deadlines can be found in the proposed rule for the First Judicial District, which the Supreme Court has not yet ordered. It was not clear on Wednesday when the justices would actually make the rule final.
Carmack-Altwies told the committee in preparation for the order, she asked lawmakers in the most recent session for funding to pay for 13 new positions, but only received money for one.
As a result, Carmack-Altwies told the committee, if the order is implemented in her district, she predicts “thousands of cases are going to be dismissed.”
In addition to personnel and budget concerns, Carmack-Altwies’ office subsequently provided Source with a statement also citing insufficient input from DAs and law enforcement to the rule; lack of computer systems that communicate with law enforcement; and crime labs that are “months or years behind.” 
“People are going to get away with crime and then I believe 10-plus years down the road, you’re going to see an astonishing increase in — an escalation in crime,” she told lawmakers.
Source requested comment on Wednesday from the Administrative Office of the Courts and will update this story if received.
The order has its supporters, though.
Chief Public Defender Bennet Baur told the committee he believes in case management orders because in an overworked system, all parties tend to focus on the crisis in front of them, and not on the new cases coming in.
“You have to hold people’s feet to the fire to get the work done on cases, especially when people are sitting in custody,” Baur said.
Before case management orders came around, a lot of people were languishing in jail and victims were waiting for justice, he said.
“Without a case management order, what pressure is there on a crime lab to actually get the results in?” Baur asked. “There needs to be some flexibility. They are imperfect, but I think they’re really important to make sure that the system moves.”
When the conversation about case management orders continued on Tuesday, New Mexico Supreme Court Chief Justice David Thomson told the committee that when courts release someone and attach a GPS monitor to their ankle, and then their case takes a year to reach a trial, “those two things are not acceptable.”
“It’s important to bring them to trial on a timely basis on those charges, and then a jury can decide whether that individual is guilty or not,” Thomson said.
Ultimately, however, lawmakers have no sway over the rules.
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque) noted there were reasons for the case management order at the time, but he encouraged district attorneys and others to “put some friendly pressure on the Supreme Court to change that.”
“We can’t do it legislatively, but those hard-and-fast deadlines are unreasonable under the circumstances, and they need to be looked at,” Maestas said.

(Photo by Katrin Ray Shumakov/Getty images)Much like the sound level from across the bay on the Fourth of July, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) isn’t making noise about the opportunity for viewing fireworks from Beavertail State Park in Jamestown.
DEM spokesperson Kimberly Keough confirmed to Rhode Island Current that the state park will remain open Friday night for viewing of the city of Newport’s annual pyrotechnics show in the distance without having to deal with loud noise. The display is slated to kick off at 9:15 p.m. 
The Department has promoted the viewing since 2019 as a way for people who are sensitive to loud noises to enjoy the holiday fireworks.
But the state is no longer referring to the event as “Quiet Fireworks” — or promoting it at all. That’s because last year proved a little too popular.
“Last year, emergency responders had difficulty gaining access because of the number of cars in the park,” Keough said in an email Wednesday. “We don’t have an exact number. Last year there were more cars than spots available (150), with cars parking along roadways in both directions.
“Due to this public safety concern and staffing constraints, the event is not being promoted; however, people are still welcome to park and enjoy the fireworks,” she continued.
To avoid the kind of traffic congestion that occurred last year, Keough said the DEM will have two law enforcement officers at the park while Jamestown police will monitor the entrance.
Parking will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, and the park will close once the lots are filled.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, spurred by Trump, will trim seven months off its environmental and safety review of Bill Gates-backed project.
The post Feds speed up review for Natrium nuclear power plant in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming may see its first commercial nuclear power plant a few months sooner than anticipated, but still sometime in 2030, according to the developer, TerraPower.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission notified the Belleview, Washington-based company Tuesday that it’s trimming seven months from an ongoing environmental review and safety evaluation of the proposed advanced, liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear reactor plant outside Kemmerer. That means it will complete its final environmental impact statement for a construction permit by Dec. 31, the agency said.
The move follows “frequent and productive engagements” with the operator, according to the commission, and brings the review process into compliance with an executive order President Donald Trump issued in May. The order was intended to reform the “NRC’s culture” and directed the agency to speed up permitting.
“This acknowledgement by the NRC that our application can be completed more quickly than originally anticipated is a testament to the incredible work by our Natrium team and the support for advanced reactors at the federal level,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said in a prepared statement.

Levesque also praised Trump for “founding” the NRC’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program during his first term. TerraPower was the first ever to submit a construction permit application for a “commercial advanced reactor” in March 2024.
“Streamlining reviews is a commonsense solution that will accelerate permitting schedules; and proves that we can bring safe, well-vetted American technologies to market faster and compete on the global stage,” Levesque said. 
The expedited review is cause for concern, Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Policy Director John Burrows told WyoFile. Residents deserve “robust and thorough” review to ensure safety, especially for an “experimental” technology such as TerraPower’s Natrium design, he said.
“Expediting the review process is not something that inspires confidence when the stakes are very high for this first-of-its-kind project,” Burrows said via email. “Similarly, the perception that the NRC is prioritizing speed over safety does not bode well for the future of nuclear technology in Wyoming — especially given the legacy of this industry and concerns that Wyomingites have raised in the past.”
The $4 billion project, backed by $2 billion from the Department of Energy, was already under a streamlined review process through the NRC’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. The plant will be operational in 2030, according to TerraPower. It will be the first utility-scale advanced nuclear power plant in the nation, the company said.
The Natrium project
After reviewing several potential sites in Wyoming, TerraPower announced in 2021 it would tap into existing infrastructure near the Naughton natural gas- and coal-fired power plant just outside the adjacent towns of Kemmerer and Diamondville in western Wyoming.
The company’s Natrium nuclear reactor is a scaled-down version of currently operating nuclear reactors. It will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of electricity — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — and will have the ability to boost the system’s output to 500 megawatts for short periods, according to the company.

TerraPower, backed by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, promotes Natrium as an “advanced” reactor design because it will use liquid sodium for cooling, which requires less water and provides more energy efficiency, it says. The plant will also use a different type of radioactive fuel referred to as high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), which is more potent than traditional nuclear fuels.
If the pilot project is successful, the company plans to deploy dozens of Natrium plants across the globe, and possibly several more in Wyoming.
Clearing permit hurdles
TerraPower commenced construction on some non-nuclear facilities associated with the project last year. The Wyoming Industrial Siting Council granted a construction permit in January, greenlighting all non-nuclear portions of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 plant.
The federal commission issued a draft environmental impact statement for the nuclear side of the project in June, one month ahead of schedule, it said. 
Though the federal agency is working under an expedited timeline, it warned there may be “unresolved items” related to any “substantive” public comments to address after the December deadline. “The accelerated timeline depends on a continued commitment from [the developer] to resolve these issues and provide necessary information in a timely manner,” the agency wrote in a letter to TerraPower.

About one in four New Mexicans gets SNAP and about two in five New Mexicans are on Medicaid.,"Charles Sallee, right, speaks to a legislative committee in 2023 in Santa Fe. Sallee, the Legislative Finance Committee director, presented some lawmakers Wednesday with a sense of the tough choices they'll have to make if the ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" becomes law in a state with the highest per-capita reliance on SNAP and Medicaid.  (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A top budget adviser to New Mexico lawmakers Wednesday laid out the most detailed look he could muster on what the Senate budget reconciliation bill could mean for New Mexico, particularly when it comes to federal spending on health care and food aid here.
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee’s presentation was to a special state legislative committee grappling with expected federal cuts. It comes a day after the United States Senate narrowly passed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which contains steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps payments over the next decade. The bill now heads back to the House.
Sallee said the Legislature’s approach in recent years of parking record oil and gas revenues in interest-earning reserve funds has insulated taxpayers from a devastating blow to the state budget. Despite that, the state cannot afford to “backfill” all the expected losses, and his team of analysts is only beginning to try to calculate the many indirect economic implications of the cuts, including to farms, hospitals and the state’s overall financial health. 
“I think fiscally, we’re in the best shape to be able to handle this,” Sallee said. But nonetheless: “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”
New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told the same committee Tuesday that as many as 88,530 New Mexicans will lose their Medicaid coverage due to provisions in the bill. The bill will also likely cause 58,180 New Mexicans to lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, she said. 
Those are significant cuts in the state that has the highest per-capita percentage of SNAP recipients and Medicaid recipients in the country. About one in four New Mexicans gets SNAP and about two in five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. 
New Mexico hospitals and patients face closure from ‘domino effect’ of potential Medicaid cuts

The Medicaid cuts would mean more than 10% of 878,000 New Mexicans who currently rely on Medicaid would lose their coverage. The SNAP cuts would mean about 13% of 463,000 SNAP recipients would lose their food benefits. 
In addition to those who lose their coverage or benefits outright, hundreds of thousands more will see benefits reduced or increased paperwork or other burdens, including work requirements, Armijo said.
Sallee tailored his presentation Wednesday to how the bill in its current form could affect state coffers and also detailed the federal budget deficit that Republican members of Congress say they’re trying to address with the cuts. Even with the lawmakers’ efforts to rein in spending, a Congressional Budget Office estimate concludes the bill will add $3.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. 
Sallee stressed that lawmakers need to look closely at when certain provisions of the bill go into effect and consider the long view of the cuts, which are phased in over years in some cases over the course of a decade, as they consider the state’s response. 
Lawmakers will have to figure out how the state will respond to caps on provider taxes and Medicaid reimbursement that will hit rural hospitals especially hard, Sallee said. 
At least 15 rural New Mexico hospitals are vulnerable to closure due to provisions in the reconciliation, Democratic senators said in a letter in June to President Donald Trump. Six to eight of them could close here within 18 months, advocates and hospital executives said last month. 
The House and Senate will have to reconcile their different methods of reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates and provider taxes states use to increase the federal share of Medicaid payments, Sallee said Wednesday. 
Report outlines how New Mexico could counter federal food benefits cuts

The Senate version reduced the tax limit by half a percent beginning next year, whereas the House version prohibits new provider taxes. The Senate version similarly phases in reductions in reimbursement rates versus the House’s approach, according to Sallee’s presentation. 
As for SNAP, uncertainty looms about whether New Mexico’s “error rate” will help or hurt it in the end, Sallee said. 
The reconciliation bill seeks to impose a share of administrative costs, as well as the cost of the benefits themselves, on states, with a higher percentage of that cost-share imposed on states that have a high degree of overpaying or underpaying SNAP benefits. New Mexico’s rate is about 14.6%, according to recent federal Agriculture Department estimates. 
The House version of the bill would make states pay between 5% and 25% of the benefit costs, plus 75% of administrative costs for SNAP, based on the error rate. A Senate version from mid-June reduces the benefit costs borne by states to between 5% and 15%. 
On Wednesday, Sallee said the Senate version of the bill passed overnight might actually “reward” states with high error rates, like New Mexico, by giving them until 2029 to fix their error rates before imposing the increased cost-share. 
“The language is not entirely clear exactly how this is going to work, who’s going to be really in or out,” he said. “But at the very least it looks like that’s an example of where you’re going to hear a lot of people saying there’s going to be big cuts for food security in New Mexico. And it’s like, let’s take a deep breath and figure out when exactly that’s going to occur, and then give you time as policy makers, to figure out how you’re going to deal with that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230817_103528-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

Aug. 10, 2024. (AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Kelli Austin is already juggling being in school, taking care of her children, and running a business. Now, the Waterville resident is worried she will have to choose between food and medicine. Or skip medical appointments so her kids can go to the doctor. 
“It’s not just me and my kids that are affected by this. There are so many kids right now with parents that are struggling, working two jobs already and juggling multiple hats just to just to barely get by,” she said.
Austin, like thousands of Mainers, relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and Medicaid, which she is scared she will lose because of work requirements in Republicans’ budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. 
“If this goes through, it’s not just numbers on a page,” she said. “It’s gonna be missed appointments, closed clinics and deferred dreams.”
Advocates are warning of the disastrous consequences if the budget reconciliation bill becomes law, including jeopardizing access to food and cutting health care from thousands of low income people and families. 
Interviews with representatives from half a dozen different groups underscored the concern that the effects of the bill will also be felt by middle class families, small businesses and rural hospitals for years to come.
The bill, which Maine’s entire congressional delegation voted against, is slated for a final vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, though stalled due to some Republican resistance. The Senate version, which Republican Sen. Susan Collins voted against after initially casting a vote to advance the bill, added provisions that made the bill worse, many experts said.  
“It is one of the largest transfers of wealth and greatest cuts to health care and food assistance in this country’s history,” said Alex Carter, a policy advocate for Maine Equal Justice, a civil legal aid and economic justice organization. “I don’t think it’s dramatic or hyperbolic to say that people are going to go hungry. People are going to not be able to meet their basic needs, and people are going to die if this bill passes.”
The bill restricts access to Medicaid, institutes work requirements for food and health care assistance, makes certain reproductive health providers ineligible for federal funding and requires states to cover some SNAP costs, the federal government currently funds. It will also increase premiums for marketplace health insurance. All those cuts are meant to pay for extending tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term that mostly benefit the wealthy, as well as fund a significant increase in immigration enforcement.
Many of the advocates who spoke with Maine Morning Star emphasized these provisions will be particularly challenging for a rural, aging state like Maine, where food insecurity, child hunger and health care infrastructure are already stressed and the state does not have extra funding to make up for federal cuts.










I don't think it's dramatic or hyperbolic to say that people are going to go hungry. People are going to not be able to meet their basic needs, and people are going to die if this bill passes.


– Alex Carter, Maine Equal Justice


“When you look at this bill and what it means for Maine and for Maine people, it effectively means that we’re going to lose services,” said Garrett Martin, president and CEO of the Maine Center for Economic Policy.
While much of the bill’s opposition has focused on the threats to Medicaid — which an estimated 30,000 Mainers could lose as a result  — there are other compounding impacts that target the same groups of people whose health care is at risk, Martin and others explained.
The impacts may not be felt immediately because different provisions in the bill take effect on different timelines (including some as late as 2028), but “it’s going to take two to three years before people really start to understand how significant this legislation is going to impact them and their communities,” Martin said.
Nutrition assistance impact 
The bill will, for the first time, make states like Maine bear some of the cost of SNAP. According to the bill, states with a higher rate of errors, meaning benefits incorrectly issued, will have to bear up to 15% of the costs of the program, which could cost the state up to $60 million in benefits —  an unsustainable burden that could effectively dismantle the entire program, according to Anna Korsen, policy and program director at Full Plates, Full Potential, which advocates for state and federal support for child nutrition. 
The bill also introduces stringent work reporting requirements that would make nutrition benefits harder to obtain and maintain, particularly for families with children and older adults. 
Although the vast majority of the 176,000 Mainers who use SNAP meet the work requirements, Korsen said the administrative challenge of filling out SNAP benefit forms is already daunting for families. Adding the additional work requirement will push people out of the program, she said.
“The problem isn’t that people aren’t working. The challenge that they’re creating is that people are going to get caught up in all of this red tape and paperwork,” she said. ​“So what they’re trying to do is just make SNAP harder to get and harder to keep.”
When she was finishing school, Austin was part of Maine’s Parents as Scholars financial aid program, which made her eligible for federal assistance. But under the budget bill, she will have to meet work requirements to be eligible for SNAP and Medicaid, which she said is a challenge as a single mom. 
“I struggle just to get by as it is, let alone taking me out of the house for that many hours and making me juggle that much more,” she said. “It’s not that we’re unwilling to work, it’s that we’re underserved.”
“I’m not asking for a handout by any right, but I’m asking for a fair shot for myself and my kids,” Austin added.
Calling Medicaid a ‘lifeline’ for Mainers, health advocates urge Collins to oppose GOP budget bill

The changes would not only impact food security but also harm local economies, with SNAP benefits generating nearly $548 million in annual economic activity in Maine. Small grocery stores could lose up to 20% of their revenue, and local farms could also suffer significant setbacks by losing the revenue that comes from SNAP. 
Korsen argued that the bill’s provisions create an all-or-nothing scenario for states, forcing them to either pay massive new costs or opt out of the SNAP program entirely.
Indirectly, the legislation also threatens other forms of food assistance, such as free school meals, summer nutrition programs, and WIC benefits, because if a family qualifies for Medicaid or SNAP benefits, they are automatically eligible for free meals. This direct certification allows school districts to be accurately reimbursed by the federal government for providing those meals.
“Schools are scared, families are scared,” Korsen said. “It’s just unbelievable that our government would think that this is okay.”
The proposal also ends the work requirement exemption for homeless people and veterans on SNAP, which means thousands of vulnerable people could go hungry, according to Terence Miller, advocacy director at the Portland-based homeless services organization Preble Street. 
That would put even more strain on privately run food banks, which already faced setbacks when the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut programs that allow them to buy from local farms.
“I mean, a veteran who fought for our country and finds themselves unhoused and needing food is no longer eligible to receive SNAP benefits,” he said. “It’s just unfathomable to me to think that those people will not be able to buy their own food.”
Impact on marketplace health insurance 
In addition to sweeping Medicaid cuts, thousands of Maine residents who rely on marketplace health insurance could see their premiums dramatically increase. 
According to an analysis by the Maine Center for Economic Policy, approximately 63,000 Mainers with marketplace coverage will be significantly impacted by the expiration of premium tax credits, Martin said.
For example, a family of four earning around $78,000 annually could see its monthly premiums double from $263 to $476. Even more stark are the potential increases for older residents: a 62-year-old couple earning $85,000 might face a premium jump from $608 to $2,346 per month.
Those premium tax credits have been crucial in making health insurance affordable, Martin explained. About 85% of marketplace participants currently receive these subsidies, which help cap health insurance costs for individuals and families.
The potential elimination of these credits represents more than just a financial burden, Martin added, it could force many Maine residents to choose between maintaining health coverage or cutting other essential expenses. 
“At the same time that health coverage is being taken away from low income households and individuals and people with disabilities, we’re also seeing a scenario in which arguably middle class families are likely to see a significant increase in costs for themselves as a consequence of this,” Martin said.

After running out of normal appeals, Terry received a temporary reprieve after claiming that he had an intellectual disability, which would mean he couldn’t be executed. Brain scans showed that Terry had damage in the part of his brain responsible for controlling focus and behavior, likely caused by a small stroke, his attorneys argued in court filings.
But Terry’s attorneys failed to prove in court that Terry had enough damage to his brain to warrant pausing his execution, meaning his death sentence “must be carried out,” Circuit Court Judge Robert Hood wrote in a decision filed Tuesday.
Terry’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
It’s unclear whether there will be additional appeals and when an execution might be scheduled.
The state Supreme Court typically sends out death warrants on Fridays, but because this Friday is a holiday, the soonest Terry might receive a warrant would be July 11.
By state law, executions must take place at 6 p.m. on the fourth Friday after a death warrant is issued.
In order for inmates to avoid the death chamber, they must prove they have “significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning” that causes “adaptive behavior” before the age of 18, Hood wrote.
Scans of Terry’s brain showed dead tissue and decreased blood flow to part of his brain. He suffered multiple head injuries before the crime for which he was convicted, including while working for a tree company in Florida, in a motorcycle accident and during a fight in which someone hit him over the head with a board, his mother testified during his 1997 trial.
Terry also started lashing out and showing problems with impulsivity after sniffing glue and losing consciousness when he was 13, his mother testified. He was later diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder, a mental health condition that causes short bouts of rage, as well as antisocial personality disorder and alcohol dependance, according to court filings.
Still, Terry’s intellectual functioning remained in the “low-average” range, which is not enough to constitute an intellectual disability. An expert who testified during Terry’s 1997 trial agreed with that conclusion, and the experts who testified on behalf of Terry during a 2024 hearing in Lexington County failed to prove any different, Hood wrote.
“The record also shows a history not of intellectual disability but of learning disabilities and drug use, which began as a teenager, and later in life, head injuries,” Hood wrote.
Terry is one of 25 inmates on South Carolina’s death row. One inmate is held in California for crimes committed in that state.
Six other inmates have been put to death since the state resumed executions in September. That followed a 13-year unintended hiatus, during which the state’s supply of lethal injection drugs expired and couldn’t be restocked.
Under an updated law keeping nearly all information about executions secret, officials were able to obtain pentobarbital, a sedative that is lethal in large doses. Last July, the state Supreme Court officially allowed the process to resume by ruling that electrocution and firing squad — a method legislators added to state law in 2021 — were constitutional.

Andy Kim and Cory Booker said Wednesday. (Spencer Platt | Getty Images)Several of New Jersey’s Democratic leaders are blasting President Donald Trump’s nomination of Alina Habba as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey as a partisan power grab aimed at reshaping the state to serve his political agenda. 
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who previously worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said Habba is unqualified for the job. Habba, 41, had no prosecutorial experience when Trump appointed her in an interim capacity in March. 
“Habba has explicitly stated her goal to politicize the office where I served as a prosecutor, and as acting U.S. Attorney, she has already weaponized it against her perceived political opponents,” Sherrill said in a statement Wednesday. 
The White House announced Tuesday that Trump nominated Habba to a full four-year term. When he previously named her as the interim attorney, Trump said Habba would “fight tirelessly to secure a legal system that is both fair and just for the wonderful people of New Jersey.”
Within days of assuming her role, Habba said she would investigate Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state’s immigration directive limiting law enforcement’s cooperation in civil immigration investigations. She also said on a conservative podcast that she hopes to “turn New Jersey red.” 
In less than four months as acting U.S. Attorney, Habba has drawn ire from judges for ignoring the historically nonpartisan stance of the office. 
She’s targeted Democratic officials who have opposed Trump’s mass detention and deportation plans, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested May 9 outside an immigrant detention facility in the city. Habba later charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, with assault in connection with a scuffle that broke out when Baraka was detained. McIver pleaded not guilty to the charges and faces a trial in November. 
When Baraka’s charges were dropped 10 days after his arrest, a judge scolded prosecutors from Habba’s office, warning them that it should not be used to “satisfy public clamor, nor to advance political agendas.” 
Baraka sued Habba over his arrest, claiming he was maliciously prosecuted out of political retribution. Habba responded by saying the mayor should join her in “prioritizing violent crime and public safety.” 
In a joint statement Wednesday, Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker, both Democrats, also accused Habba of degrading her office. 
“The people of New Jersey deserve a U.S. Attorney that has deep experience with law enforcement, a reputation and an approach that puts partisanship to the side and who will work to keep our communities safe and impartially pursue justice,” they said. “In her short tenure as an interim U.S. Attorney, she has degraded the office and pursued frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”
Habba hasn’t responded to the criticism but did repost a defense on social media Wednesday by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who called her “a fearless, fair, and effective public servant.”
Habba must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of July, but a confirmation hearing has not yet been scheduled. Her 120-day interim appointment expires in three weeks, but judges in New Jersey’s U.S. District Court could allow her to stay pending confirmation.

I think cruelty is the point,” Feist, 61, of Washington, D.C., and originally from North Dakota, told States Newsroom. “It's also extremely alarming that there's such cowardice in the GOP.”The massive budget reconciliation package, passed by Senate Republicans Tuesday with a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance, extends and expands 2017 tax cuts at a cost of roughly $4.5 trillion over the next decade. It also yanks funding from federal food and health safety net programs.

The bill aggressively rolls back clean energy tax credits, as well as raising the nation’s borrowing limit to $5 trillion.Latest figures from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office show the package would add $3.4 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade, when the country is mired in record-breaking debt. That office’s earlier analysis of the House-passed bill found the package would reduce resources for low-income families while padding higher earners.Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, who chaired an hours-long final committee hearing about the bill overnight, said Wednesday the package is an “embodiment of the America First agenda and we would all do well to remember that.”Medicaid cutsTop of mind for Feist is the bill’s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income individuals and some with disabilities. The Senate version of the package, passed Tuesday, included a  $1 trillion cut to Medicaid over 10 years, according to the CBO.“I have parents in North Dakota who are 85 and 86. They already have difficulty seeing their doctor. For every doctor that leaves, he takes on 14 times more burden. Rural health care is already extremely difficult. I would expect there will not be a hospital near where my parents live if this bill is signed into law,” said Feist, whose parents live near Minot.Rural hospitals rely on Medicaid payments. In a last-minute move before Tuesday’s vote, Senate Republicans doubled a fund to $50 billion to subsidize hospitals that will lose funding. Critics say that amount is not enough to fill the gap.GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina voted no after voicing concerns over Medicaid cuts.SNAP and ICEMark Starr sang a protest song he wrote about the “big beautiful bill” as he played guitar and harmonica outside the Longworth House Office Building Wednesday.The 39-year-old Albuquerque, New Mexico, native told States Newsroom he drove to the capital in late April to begin protesting the bill.

Critics worry that states could tighten eligibility requirements or drop the program because of the financial burden.The left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates 55,000 teens age 14 and up, and adults up to age 64 could lose food assistance in New Mexico because of the bill’s cuts to state work requirement waivers. Children would remain eligible but households would overall see significantly decreased SNAP dollars.The CBO found in late May that the House-passed bill would result in over 3 million people nationwide losing food assistance.Starr said he’s also against additional funding provided for immigration enforcement.“I think they have enough,” he said, pointing to Trump’s visit to a new detention facility in Florida that the White House is touting as “Alligator Alcatraz.”The Senate-approved version includes an additional $45 billion for ICE detention facilities and $29.9 billion for ICE enforcement and deportation, among billions more directed toward the Southern border.Clean energy to take a hitTiernan Sittenfeld, of the League of Conservation Voters, huddled just outside the House with a group wearing t-shirts that read “Hands off our air, land and clean energy.”Sittenfeld, the organization’s senior vice president of government affairs, argues the rollbacks of clean energy tax credits in the Senate version will “kill clean energy jobs.”“It is bad for our economy. It's bad for jobs. It's going to raise people's energy bills. And of course, it's bad for the planet,” she said.Senate Republicans accelerated the phase-out of some residential, manufacturing and production credits at a faster rate than the House bill. A last-minute change loosened the timeline on some tech-neutral energy credits though, and removed a previously added tax on wind and solar projects.

Industry groups and energy companies small and large have warned early termination of the credits will have a major impact on growth.The tax credits for solar, wind, batteries for energy storage, and electric vehicles, among others, were enacted under Democrats’ own 2022 budget reconciliation bill known as the “Inflation Reduction Act.”The majority of investment in new clean energy manufacturing and production has been concentrated in rural states and states that elected Trump to his second term, according to data collected since 2022 by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.“Any Republican who votes for this legislation is voting against the interest of their constituents, voting to kill jobs in their district, voting to kill clean energy projects, voting to make their constituents’ energy bills go up,” Sittenfeld said.Far-right House members who as of Wednesday afternoon were withholding their votes maintain the rollbacks on the clean energy tax cuts, which",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday it has frozen six federal programs that collectively distribute $6.8 billion across the country. The federal agency said it would not send out the money by July 1, the start of the 2026 fiscal year for states and schools, because it is still reviewing the funding.
“The department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president’s priorities and the department’s statutory responsibilities,” the agency wrote in a message to states.
Withheld funds include nearly $31.37 million that Oklahoma districts use for teacher professional development, $15.68 million that support before- and after-school programs, $6.43 million dedicated for the 13% of Oklahoma students learning English as their non-native language and $240,000 for the children of migrant workers. Another $7.3 million for adult education in Oklahoma also is affected.
The Trump administration also said it froze funds from Title IV Part A, which provide $16.35 million for academic enrichment in Oklahoma schools. However, the Oklahoma State Department of Education said it started receiving money from this program for the 2026 fiscal year.
Federal dollars from the other affected funds have not yet arrived, the state department reported last week.

State Superintendent Ryan Walters advised schools to budget only for federal funds that already have been awarded.
“We appreciate the fact that the Trump administration is working diligently to ensure our taxpayer dollars are being stewarded with care,” Walters said in a statement. “(The state Department of Education) is working in lockstep with the Trump administration to assist with our mutually-aligned education priorities.”
Walters also took to social media to mock California being frozen out of the same programs that Oklahoma and all other states are currently unable to access.
In response to California state Superintendent Tony Thurmond saying the Trump administration’s withholding of funds “will harm students” and “cannot stand,” Walters wrote in a Tuesday post, “Don’t break the law by pushing racist CRT and DEI tactics, by push LGBTQ ideology on kids, and even allow boys to compete in women’s sports.”
The U.S. Department of Education has proposed eliminating the affected programs in future years. Instead, it aims to give out larger, more flexible grants that state leaders can decide how to spend.
In Oklahoma City Public Schools, 47% of students are learning English as their second language. The district expected $1.1 million in federal revenue from Title III, which supports English learners, according to its annual budget, which the Oklahoma City Board of Education approved Monday.
Oklahoma City schools also projected $7.6 million in Title II funds for teacher professional development, up from $3.3 million last year.

“We urge federal leaders to reconsider this action, as these dollars directly support essential staff and programs that make a difference for our students every day,” district spokesperson Crystal Raymond said in a statement. “These funds are critical to our ability to support educators and deliver on our commitment to student success. As always, we will continue to put students first, and we look forward to welcoming our 33,000 students back to classrooms on Aug. 13.”
Now-frozen federal dollars also enable before- and after-school programs across the state, mostly in rural areas. Money for the initiative comes from Title IV Part B, also known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers.
Eufaula Public Schools in eastern Oklahoma receives $300,000 from this program to fund its after-school care and summer learning, Superintendent Monty Guthrie said.
The district also receives about $50,000 for teacher recruitment and professional development from Title II, also known as “supporting effective instruction.” Teacher development needs have become more expensive, Guthrie said, as emergency certified educators and uncertified adjunct teachers become more common in Oklahoma.
Federal money for after-care programs allows Eufaula schools to provide these services for free to low-income families who otherwise wouldn’t be able to pay, Guthrie said. About 180 students participate throughout the school year.
These programs are a “huge, huge plus,” he said, especially in rural towns that have few other childcare options.
Eufaula schools would need to receive federal funds by November for the program to be financially viable this school year, Guthrie said. Otherwise, the district would have to discontinue the services, “which would be very difficult for our families.”
“You just have to plan to continue on, and if things change we’ll have to adjust,” Guthrie said. “We certainly feel that it is a great service to our students and our parents, and we’re going to try to provide that.”

Esto es lo que debe saber.","Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Read this story in English.
El 30 de mayo, el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de EE. UU. (DHS) publicó una lista de más de 500 ciudades, condados y estados que designó como jurisdicciones “santuario”. El propio estado de Connecticut, además de seis de sus municipios, figuraban en la lista, ahora eliminada.
Algunos representantes locales se sorprendieron al ver a sus municipios en la lista. Otros no.
El término “ciudad santuario” es controvertido porque no tiene una definición legal oficial, pero generalmente se refiere a las jurisdicciones que limitan su cooperación con las autoridades federales de inmigración.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las ciudades santuario y la reacción de los funcionarios de Connecticut ante la designación del DHS.
¿Qué son las ciudades santuario?
Según Global Refuge, una organización sin fines de lucro que ayuda a las personas a establecerse en EE. UU., las ciudades santuario tienen políticas que establecen límites sobre la información o el apoyo que los gobiernos locales o estatales brindan a las autoridades federales de inmigración. 
El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, por su parte, clasifica una jurisdicción santuario como “ciudades, condados y estados que obstruyen deliberadamente la aplicación de las leyes federales de inmigración y ponen en peligro a los ciudadanos estadounidenses”.
Según la organización nacional Vera Institute of Justice, las ciudades santuario suelen ubicarse en zonas con grandes poblaciones de inmigrantes.
Según el Consejo Americano de Inmigración, algunas de las llamadas “políticas santuario” pueden incluir medidas como: limitar la capacidad de la policía local o estatal para “arrestar o detener a personas por violaciones civiles federales de inmigración”; prohibir acuerdos de cooperación como el 287(g), que permite al ICE (Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas) designar a agentes locales; impedir que el personal local pregunte sobre el estatus migratorio o restringir la información que se puede compartir con agencias federales.
¿Qué ciudades de Connecticut estaban en la lista?
Las ciudades de East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford y Hamden fueron incluidas en la lista del DHS. El propio estado de Connecticut también fue designado como “jurisdicción santuario”. El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional no explicó por qué se citó específicamente a estas ciudades de Connecticut ni cuáles fueron los criterios para su inclusión en la lista. Tampoco explicó por qué se eliminó la lista.
De los municipios incluidos en la lista, solo Hartford y Windham han promulgado resoluciones que se autodenominan ciudades santuario, mientras que New Haven y Hamden se han designado como “Ciudades Acogedoras”.
En un comunicado, la ciudad de East Haven afirmó que su inclusión en la lista fue incorrecta. “Seamos claros: ninguna agencia federal informó a la ciudad de East Haven sobre esta designación, ni estamos de acuerdo con ella”, afirmaba el comunicado.
“La clasificación emitida por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional no solo fue absurda, sino también infundada”, declaró el alcalde de East Haven, Joseph A. Carfora. “Antes de que se eliminara la página, mi administración contactó al DHS para exigir una aclaración y comprender cómo se hizo una declaración tan infundada sin consultar ni comunicarse con nuestra oficina. No permitiremos que East Haven sea malinterpretada sin rendir cuentas.”
Sin embargo, los funcionarios de New Haven y Windham también afirmaron que nunca recibieron notificación de su inclusión en la lista. “Windham tiene una gran población latina y es bien sabido que la actual administración [federal] se centra en las comunidades pobres, ya que contamos con recursos limitados”, declaró el alcalde Thomas DeVivo.
El alcalde de New London, Michael Passero, afirmó desconocer la definición de ciudad santuario. “Solo puedo decirles que New London nunca se ha declarado ciudad santuario”, afirmó.
¿Cuáles son las políticas de la ciudad en materia de inmigración?
No todas las ciudades se consideran ciudades santuario, pero todas tienen políticas que abordan la inmigración de alguna manera. 
En New Haven, el alcalde Justin Elicker firmó una orden ejecutiva de “Ciudad Acogedora” en 2020, afirmando “el compromiso de la ciudad de garantizar que los residentes se sientan seguros al acceder a los servicios públicos”.
La directiva prohíbe a los empleados municipales preguntar o revelar el estatus migratorio de una persona, a menos que lo exija la ley estatal o federal. Elicker declaró en una conferencia de prensa el mes pasado que New Haven no obstruye la justicia. Añadió que las políticas de bienvenida de la ciudad hacen que la comunidad sea más segura al animar a las personas a denunciar delitos, buscar atención médica y enviar a sus hijos a la escuela sin temor.
“Esto era algo que esperábamos y estamos orgullosos de ello”, declaró en una conferencia de prensa, refiriéndose a la inclusión de New Haven en la lista de ciudades santuario. “New Haven se enorgullece de ser una ciudad acogedora… Nuestra comunidad inmigrante es parte de nuestra familia New Haven”.
La política de East Haven es que, dado que la aplicación de las leyes migratorias es responsabilidad del gobierno federal, el Departamento de Policía de East Haven generalmente no participa en operaciones de ICE, excepto “cuando se le solicite formalmente como parte de una investigación criminal en curso, o para notificar a los funcionarios federales en situaciones graves donde se perciba una amenaza a la seguridad pública o nacional”.
El Código de Ordenanzas de Hartford declara oficialmente a Hartford como una “ciudad santuario”. Las leyes locales establecen que todos los residentes de Hartford, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, tienen igual acceso a los servicios municipales y a las derivaciones a agencias médicas o sociales. Esta política no impide que los empleados municipales cooperen con las autoridades federales de inmigración cuando sea legalmente requerido.
Las políticas de Hamden limitan la participación de la policía local en la aplicación de las leyes migratorias federales. Los agentes no pueden preguntar sobre el estatus migratorio a menos que esté relacionado con una investigación criminal, ni interrogar a víctimas o testigos sobre su estatus. Tampoco pueden arrestar ni detener a personas basándose únicamente en órdenes de detención civiles u órdenes administrativas, excepto según lo exija la ley estatal. Los recursos municipales, incluyendo la policía y el personal escolar, no pueden utilizarse para ayudar a ICE a menos que así lo exija una ley estatal o una orden de un juez federal.
New London ha compartido en su sitio web municipal el Plan de Preparación Familiar: Preparando a la Familia para la Aplicación de la Ley de Inmigración. Este es un documento estatal que contiene información para familias preocupadas por la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, no específico de New London.
El Departamento de Policía de New London prohíbe a los oficiales preguntar sobre el estatus migratorio a menos que esté directamente relacionado con una investigación criminal, según una orden ejecutiva local. Los oficiales tampoco pueden detener o interrogar a personas únicamente por sospechas de violaciones migratorias, pero la política establece que la policía local puede ayudar a las autoridades federales si se les solicita.
Windham se convirtió en una ciudad santuario tras una resolución de 2017 aprobada por unanimidad. La resolución reafirmó su compromiso de proteger a todos los residentes, incluyendo a los inmigrantes indocumentados que contribuyen a la comunidad. También establece que ningún funcionario o personal municipal arrestará, detendrá ni denunciará a una persona basándose únicamente en su estatus migratorio o de ciudadanía, excepto debido a una orden judicial penal válida o para cumplir con una orden de detención migratoria civil.

On Tuesday, as the federal government continued its unprecedented attack on clean energy and climate funding, Vermont’s Climate Council published its 2025 Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote resiliency in the state.
The plan is a requirement set by the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act to publish a new framework every four years for tackling the climate crisis. The 2025 plan could guide legislative action on helping Vermonters, especially those with low or moderate incomes, adopt more efficient and less polluting sources of home heat and transportation, the two highest-emitting sectors in the state. 
Other priorities included mitigating future climate hazards, building a climate-ready workforce, weatherizing an additional 79,000 homes, reducing or sequestering emissions on farmland and finding funding to implement all these ideas.
While Vermont files its second Climate Action Plan to try and meet legally-binding emissions reductions, federal funding programs that made possible climate initiatives in small states like this one are on the chopping block. Now, as the state looks for other sources of revenue and support to achieve its climate goals, the new plan lays out what Vermonters might see prioritized in the coming years. But with reduced political will in the last legislative session to proactively deal with climate change, it remains to be seen whether those plans are fiscally realistic under a governor who prioritizes short-term affordability over long-term resiliency.

“Before focusing too much on a new, shiny thing, we should really be thinking about how we maintain the current pace and level of effort,” said Julie Moore, Agency of Natural Resources secretary and a member of the Climate Council who voted for the plan. “Maintaining our current pace is far from certain in this moment.” 
The state’s initial Climate Action Plan preceded devastating floods that wrecked homes and businesses along Vermont’s river valleys in 2023 and 2024. As the atmosphere warms, holding more moisture, precipitation in Vermont has become heavier and more frequent, causing deluges that can lead to deadly floods. 
Climate change, largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has also brought increased high heat days that most homes in Vermont are ill-equipped to handle. Wildland fires have become more common and air quality has diminished in the warmer months as enormous wildfires burn elsewhere, according to the plan.
But even with the tangible effects of climate change in Vermont, state lawmakers’ attempts to significantly reduce emissions along outlines from the 2021 Climate Action Plan have failed to meet state emissions targets. Big proposals like the clean heat standard were shelved during the spring legislative session, and the state likely missed its 2025 emissions-reduction target required by the Global Warming Solutions Act. A court case currently playing out in Montpelier could help determine whether the state missed that target.
Now, as the state looks for more guidance on how to lower its emissions, the federal government could squeeze Vermont further as the Trump administration eviscerates clean energy funding and advances in climate science prioritized under President Biden. The 2025 Climate Action Plan recognized the impact of federal cuts, noting that the work to combat climate change was not about to get easier.

What’s in the plan?
The Global Warming Solutions Act binds the state to lower greenhouse gas emissions by milestones set in state statute: 26% below 2005 emissions levels by 2025, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. 
The Climate Action Plan outlines pathways to reach those goals every four years, through Climate Council planning meetings, technical analysis with consultants, and community input. More than 1,000 Vermonters and Vermont-based organizations participated in creating the plan, including 850 who joined virtual and in-person meetings and 250 who submitted public comments, according to the plan.
But even with four years of planning, Vermont is still behind its legally-binding goals. While the state initially claimed that it reached that first milestone on Jan. 1, 2025, a report by the Energy Action Network, a Vermont-based collective of energy nonprofits, instead found Vermont to have fallen up to 39% short of the emissions reduction required by law. 
Moore’s agency reviewed the report and has agreed that the state was unlikely to achieve the 2025 goal, but final datasets to assess emissions won’t be available until 2027.
Previous ambitious reductions programs like the clean heat standard were shelved after a campaign by out-of-state fuel lobbyists along with Gov. Phil Scott’s rejection of the plan as unaffordable. State regulators found costs associated with the program were too high, but some members of the Climate Council disagree with those fiscal priorities. 
“When we have a conversation on benefits and costs, we can’t lose sight of the cost of the status quo, which is already too high,” said Jared Duval, one of the 23 state-appointed members of the Climate Council. He quoted numbers from the state tax department that found about $2 billion a year was spent on fossil fuels for transportation and heating in 2024. An economic analysis done for the Climate Action Plan identified a potential $6 billion in costs that could be avoided by 2050 if the state pursued emissions reductions recommendations, Duval said. 
With the lapse in federal funding, Duval said that in order to reduce emissions, the state would need to return to the polluter-pays principle, where fossil fuel corporations are responsible for paying for climate damages and resiliency efforts. This principle doesn’t only apply to the state’s legal battle with fossil fuel corporations in the climate superfund law, Duval said. It also stands as the rationale behind ambitious programs like the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest model, which the climate action plan asked the state to research this year. 
“The cost of those policies has always been designed to apply to importers of fossil fuels to Vermont,” Duval said. While fuel companies have said those costs will be passed onto customers, Duval said a key difference between the clean heat standard, pursued through the 2021 climate action plan, and the cap-and-invest model, again pushed forward by the 2025 plan, is that cap-and-invest can provide direct payments to Vermonters through rebates, based on their income. 
Duval, along with 15 others, voted for the 2025 plan. Two councillors were not present to vote, and five voted against it, including Sarah Clark, the Agency of Administration secretary; Anson Tebbetts, the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets secretary; Michele Boomhower on behalf of Joe Flynn, the Agency of Transportation secretary; Lindsay Kurrle, Agency of Commerce and Community Development secretary; and Matt Cota, owner of Meadow Hill Consulting and representing the fuel sector. All except for Cota are in Gov. Scott’s administration and report to the governor, who has worked to overturn the legal requirements in the Global Warming Solutions Act. 
Others were reluctant with their yes votes. While Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources,, voted for the plan, she said that decision was mainly a reflection of her appreciation of the work of state government staff. Moore said she continues to have “some real concerns.”
“Specifically, I’m concerned about what it will take to operationalize the plan’s vision,” Moore said. “It’s sort of left up to interpretation.”
The Conservation Law Foundation, which sued the state last year claiming the Agency of Natural Resources failed to properly prepare to meet the 2025 emissions goal, called the 2025 Climate Action Plan “toothless” in a statement on Tuesday. 
“The Council has worked hard to come to a consensus and deliver recommendations that include financial incentives to drive down emissions,” said Elena Mihaly, the foundation’s vice president for Vermont. “But it has failed to put in place real, enforceable policies that demand major polluters do their part too.”

The return of cap-and-invest
Much of the council’s attention this last year has been on a cap-and-invest program to reduce climate pollution. Cap-and-invest programs place a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions, according to the state, while reinvesting the proceeds to climate-friendly projects like energy efficiency and weatherization. In March, Mike Pieciak, Vermont state treasurer, spoke to the council during a special session on cap-and-invest, reminding members that of the billions the state spends on fossil fuels, “over 75% of those dollars flow out of the state.”
But a cap-and-invest model could keep more money in the state and create up to 810 jobs, according to Pieciak, especially if the state were to partner with cap-and-invest initiatives already underway such as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, Quebec and Washington, and the cap-and-invest program in New York state. A modified clean heat standard could complement this program, according to the 2025 Climate Action Plan, focusing on the electrification of air and water heating in low- and moderate-income households. 
Such a partnership could avoid problems that Vermont encountered while pursuing a clean heat standard, the council’s previous plan to reduce thermal emissions. In a January report, the Public Utility Commission, which studied the clean heat program, told lawmakers that it would likely be too expensive for the state to take on a first-of-its-kind credit market on its own. 
But this isn’t the first time cap-and-invest has been studied. Over the last four years, the Legislature asked the agency, under guidance from the 2021 Climate Action Plan, to dig into both the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest program. 
“We’re a little bit taken aback by the price tag associated with each one, along with the administrative complexity,” Moore said. “I’m hopeful that there will be an opportunity for conversation about both what we can do with existing resources.”
Moore said the cap-and-invest program could only work if Vermont joins a multi-state program, and the only one that currently exists – the Western Climate Initiative – has indicated they’re not accepting new members, she said. New York’s plan for cap-and-invest, which could be a better fit as a neighboring state, is not yet operational. Instead, Moore said, the state should focus on more actionable items like continuing to weatherize homes as federal funding disappears. 
“It’s absolutely important to acknowledge long term savings associated with these practices, but you can’t gloss over the fact that there are real and significant upfront costs,” Moore said. “Figuring out how to pay for this work to generate long-term savings is fundamental, and the climate plan, I feel, doesn’t give enough treatment to that issue.” 
Richard Cowart, the former chair of the Public Utility Commission and a member of the Climate Council, said the 2025 plan did a good job marrying provisions that can help communities become more resilient against the impacts of climate change alongside measures to reduce carbon emissions, while also saving the state money.
“The notion that addressing climate change has to be viewed simply as a burden is incorrect,” Cowart said, noting that instead the state’s economy could benefit from doing its part to slow the warming world. “How can we afford to continue to spend $2 billion a year to import fossil fuels that we know that we shouldn’t actually be burning?”
He pointed to Efficiency Vermont as an example of how the state has invested in efficiency, saved money, and provided environmental and health benefits. The 2025 plan builds on that experience, he said, and shows that the state doesn’t require federal money to build important programs like the first-of-its-kind utility launched a quarter century ago. 
“We did not need money to launch Efficiency Vermont, instead we made our own decision to reduce bills for Vermonters,” Cowart said. “We can and need to do the same thing with respect to our ongoing fossil fuel bills.”
Federal funding cuts
But how the state will pay for myriad programs and strategies the 2025 plan puts forward appears to be the crux of the climate debate in Vermont, as the arguments over affordability continue. 
On the federal level, the attack on climate action has never been more brutal. For months, the Trump administration has worked to gut billions of dollars in renewable energy incentives and subsidies for proven initiatives like buying electric vehicles and scaling up charging infrastructure, increasing financial access to heat pumps and solar panels, and supporting big-budget projects like green hydrogen and wind energy.
“The cost of electricity to the people you represent and the folks I represent in Vermont is going up,” said U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., directing the remark toward President Trump.
On Friday, Senate Republicans announced a new axe to clean energy: In the Trump administration’s budget overhaul called the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Senate suggested not only cutting federal funding for renewables but taxing those projects. 
The proposal would have penalized solar and wind projects if they sourced materials from countries the Trump administration has a strained relationship with , including China, which dominates the world in clean energy production and materials. The North America’s Building Trades Unions called it “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country” and equated it to “terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects.”
On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate passed the budget reconciliation bill, all but ensuring that Trump’s agenda will go into effect later this summer. But the tax was removed before Vice President J.D. Vance casted the tie-breaking vote as three GOP Senators – Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Tim Tillis of North Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – broke with their party and voted against the bill.
The bill now moves for a vote in the House.  
“In Vermont and across the country, this bill will kill jobs, raise energy prices and move us in exactly the wrong direction in the fight against climate change,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told VTDigger in an email on Monday before the vote. “It will keep our country hooked on dirty and expensive fossil fuels by creating enormous new handouts for the very industry that is destroying the planet in pursuit of massive profits.”
Increasing frequency and severity of disasters have also taken the toll in Vermont: Since 1953, out of the 62 federally declared disasters in the state, half have occurred since 2011. 
The analysis of these disasters was included in the 2025 plan, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency tool that outlined those disasters was taken down by FEMA on June 30, the day before the report was published. Days earlier, the federal climate website, climate.gov, disappeared. 
The web address now redirects users to the climate webpage of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal government’s premier climate science agency currently facing severe staffing and funding cuts. The country’s sixth National Climate Assessment, which provides essential data for state and regional reports like this one, was shelved this spring when scientists were told to stop their work. 
With or without federal support, Vermont will begin its third Climate Action Plan in 2028, with a new publication planned for July 1, 2029.

Greg Gianforte and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Shultz on Monday formalized a shared forest management agreement the governor said was the first of its kind between the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Calling it a “a model for collaborative landscape scale partnerships,” Schultz said the agreement establishes a new framework to “dramatically increase the pace and scale” of forest restoration, wildlife risk reduction and sustainable timber production across Montana’s national forests and adjacent land.
“Our forests are truly key to our Montana way of life, but this key part of our way of life is at risk. Over 60% of forested acres in our state are classified as being at high or very high risk of wildfire and insect infestations or both,” Gianforte said in remarks with Schultz near Helena that were posted online. “These risks threaten the health of our forests. They threaten our rural communities and our water supplies. It’s important that we work collaboratively to address these risks and make our forests healthy again.”
The new 20-year agreement with the Forest Service is the first of its kind in the nation, Gianforte said, and will implement a shared forest management vision across more than 200,000 acres of forested land in northwest Montana. 
According to the governor’s office, the new Shared Stewardship Agreement will leverage the EXPLORE Act and Good Neighbor Authority to streamline projects and reduce regulatory delays. Both the state and Forest Service said they’ll jointly select large-scale management projects. 
The EXPLORE Act is a bipartisan outdoor recreation package of legislation that passed Congress late last year and included specific provisions championed by Montana Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Ryan Zinke.
For more than a decade, the Good Neighbor Authority, authorized under the 2014 Farm Bill, has allowed the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to partner with federal agencies to manage and restore federal lands using state procedures, personnel and contracts. Given that 70% of Montana’s forested land is federally owned, the program has given Montana, and similar states in the West, more leeway in management decisions. 
Amanda Kaster, director of the DNRC, said that since the good neighbor agreement launched, the state has sold more than 100 million board feet of timber while helping safeguard Montana’s communities from wildfire threats. 
“Importantly, the revenue that is generated is reinvested into forest restoration, further reducing wildfire risk near our homes and our municipal watersheds,” Kaster said. “Over the next five years, we’re going to work on identifying and launching five to 10 site specific projects, to not only expand our good neighbor authority work into recreation infrastructure, but also strengthen wildfire resilience and community preparedness.”

Kaster said the first project is slated to begin this year, and the DNRC will be launching a public online dashboard that will track acres treated, board feet harvested and community safety improvements made through the new partnership. 
In a statement, Secretary of Agriculture Brook Rollins said the agreement is “exactly the kind of forward-leaning, state-driven leadership that President Trump and USDA have championed since day one. By cutting burdensome, unnecessary red tape and empowering Montana to lead, we’re proving that through real partnership, conservation and economic growth can go hand-in-hand.”
The shared stewardship agreement states that Montana’s forests are increasingly threatened by more frequent and severe wildfires, widespread insect and disease outbreaks and a “historic lack of active management” requiring a “new, integrated approach.”
By working together, the agencies aim to increase the pace and scale of restoration through coordinated planning and implementation; meet President Donald Trump’s goal of expanding domestic timber production through aggressive annual harvest targets; implement new and expanded categorical exclusions to streamline projects; continue to leverage state-federal partnerships through the Good Neighbor Authority; and increase the pace and scale of thinning and fuels reduction projects. 
The first project, expected to begin this year, is projected to cover a 200,000-acre swath of national forest land with a focus on marketable timber, according to the agreement. The agencies will sign a Good Neighbor Authority agreement for this first project by the end of the year. 
Following the start of that first project, the agencies will select two to four additional landscape-scale projects for feasibility assessments.  
In addition to the large-scale project, the agencies will also work on from five to 10 site-specific projects using streamlined permitting processes provided by the EXPLORE Act, with the first one initiated by the end of 2024. 
The agreement also outlines a commitment to an “annual sustainable volume” of timber harvest as much as 100 million board feet. 
“While our state has a tradition of partnership with the Forest Service, the state of Montana’s forest demands stronger action and closer cooperation,” Gianforte said. “… Together, we can actively manage our forests, reduce fire risk, support local jobs, improve habitat and expand recreational opportunities. And yes, we can make forests healthy again.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

Title X, a federal program that has been providing money for family planning services to states for over 50 years, flows through Converge to 91 clinics around the state. On March 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Converge it was withholding $4.5 million intended for Mississippi’s Title X program indefinitely during an investigation into the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. 
“We are relieved to have received our Notice of Award for Title X funding today, which enables us to return to the essential work of supporting our clinical network, maintaining operations, and meeting the needs of our communities across Mississippi and Tennessee,” Jamie Bardwell, co-executive director of Converge, said in a statement. 
The nonprofit will be rehiring some of the 10 staff it laid off, but is not currently able to rehire all due to “continued instability of federal funds,” Audrey Sandusky, vice president of communications and marketing at Converge, told Mississippi Today. 
The team received a letter from HHS on June 25 that the investigation found Converge to be compliant with the law and that funding would be restored. 
“OASH (Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health) reminds you of your ongoing obligation to comply with all terms of the award, including by not engaging in any unlawful diversity, equity or inclusion-related discrimination in violation of such laws,” the letter read. 
That same day, Sen. Bradford Blackmon, D-Canton, wrote a letter urging Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to push HHS to restore Converge’s funding. Blackmon wrote that the money supported services delivered through federally qualified health centers, which he called “lifelines in both rural and urban areas of our state.”

“The stakes for our communities could not be higher,” Blackmon wrote. “In 2024 alone, over 16,800 Mississippians, the majority of whom are uninsured and living at or below the federal poverty level, relied on Title X-supported services provided by Converge’s network.”
A spokesperson for Reeves did not immediately respond to Mississippi Today’s questions Wednesday about whether the governor advocated for the return of federal funding to Converge.
Blackmon has been a supporter of reproductive health care. Last session, he introduced a protest bill called the “Contraception Begins at Erection Act,” which would have made it unlawful for men to discharge genetic material without the intent to fertilize an embryo. 
Converge leaders still do not know what prompted the HHS investigation, though the initial allegation referenced a 2020 statement the nonprofit made committing to diversity in health care during the wake of the George Floyd protests. 
The team is proceeding with caution, but eager to resume a range of services related to helping people get pregnant, preventing pregnancy through birth control like long-acting contraception, cancer screening, pregnancy testing and STI testing and treatment. 
“This marks a critical step forward for communities that have gone without essential family planning funding for three months and have worked tirelessly to provide care with limited resources,” Bardwell said. “We look forward to resuming services, reconnecting patients with trusted providers, and continuing the vital work of ensuring access to high-quality, compassionate care across the South.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06163254/3X0A6460-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

The state has enacted seven anti-ESG measures, not including resolutions, since 2021. Connor Gibson, one of the report’s authors, said the ESG label is nebulous, but often takes aim at climate goals, social justice initiatives and culture war targets. 
Much of the legislation that has moved through statehouses in the U.S. is based on model bills propagated by right-leaning think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, he said. The bills often prohibit state entities from giving contracts to or investing in businesses proponents believe discriminate against firearm manufacturers or fossil fuel companies, for example.
 Pleiades head Frances Sawyer said in an interview that anti-ESG legislation prevents companies and fund managers from considering risk factors associated with a changing climate if they want to do business with state governments. 
“Climate economic shocks are here. Right-wing extremists, backed by the fossil fuel sector, have been working nonstop to undermine responsible investment practices in several states across the country under the framework of ‘anti-ESG’ legislation,” Sawyer said in a press release. 
“These policies are costly for investors, pension holders, municipalities, and taxpayers, and it’s critically important that other states, investors, and companies hold the line amid rising climate costs and risks — and protect the right to respond to the climate crisis rationally.”
The climate advisory group’s 2025 Statehouse Report highlighted the anti-ESG trends in legislatures across the country. Arkansas was one of the most effective states in passing such laws, said Gibson. While some states, like Missouri and Arizona, have proposed dozens of anti-ESG bills only to pass one or none, most of the legislation that’s gone before Arkansas lawmakers ended up becoming law.
In 2025, “most of the 106 anti-ESG bills introduced in statehouses failed to advance, and only 9 have been signed by governors,” the report said. Two of those nine bills were passed in Arkansas. Two more bills are awaiting a governor’s signature in other states.
The 2025 numbers are down from 2023, which saw 165 bills introduced nationwide with 22 ultimately passing. Pleiades Strategy first began tracking anti-ESG bills in 2023.  
The targets of these bills are often the large capital funds managed by state governments, such as pension funds, and state contracting, Sawyer and Gibson said. The language often prevents state agencies or pension funds from contracting or investing with any company that boycotts fossil fuel companies, firearms companies or other industries. In the bills Arkansas has passed, there are exceptions for certain situations.
Sawyer said such bills can increase costs for governments by limiting the pool of businesses it can do business with.
Act 411 of 2023 was one such anti-ESG bill that made it into law in Arkansas, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, who said in a House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting in February 2023 that it was designed “to make sure that we’re following our beliefs in the state and making sure that nobody’s discriminating against the industries that are important to Arkansas.” 
The law requires state investment funds to divest from firms that “discriminate” against certain industries, such as energy companies and firearm businesses, which are placed on a blacklist. Firms currently on the Arkansas blacklist are Goldman Sachs, TD Bank, Credit Suisse and others.
However, Arkansas became one of the only states to roll back a small part of its anti-ESG legislation in 2025 when it passed Act 252 of 2025. The new law broadened a clause in Act 411 to allow any public entity subject to the law to avoid divesting from blacklisted firms if the divestment would result in a negative financial impact.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/money-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, speaks at a press conference on protecting public lands alongside   U.S. House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, May 28, 2025, at the Lake Estes Marina. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democrats railed against the Republican-led spending cut and tax break package on Wednesday morning as the U.S. House of Representatives inches toward a vote on its final passage.
The bill, which has a Friday deadline imposed by President Donald Trump, would make permanent 2017 tax cuts and slash over $1 trillion in federal funding over a decade for safety net programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance programs. It would fulfill a bulk of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, including boosting spending for defense and border security.
But Democrats say it is a transfer of wealth from struggling Americans to the wealthy.
“It really is a travesty of any kind of common sense. We’re the wealthiest country on Earth, and we spent the last several days arguing with Republicans over whether 17 million Americans deserve to have health care. I thought we’d gotten past that,” Sen. John Hickenlooper told reporters during a Wednesday morning press conference.
Colorado’s four Democratic representatives voted against the bill when it initially went through the House in May, and the state’s four GOP House members voted in favor of it. On Tuesday, Colorado’s Democratic U.S. senators voted against it.
The House is expected to consider the Senate’s version of the bill sometime on Wednesday.
“This will clearly exacerbate and turbo charge a poverty crisis in our country by virtue of the cruel cuts that have been included in the bill that Republicans are attempting to shove through here over the course of the next several hours,” said Rep. Joe Neguse, a Boulder Democrat. “We’re going to use every procedural tool that we can to try to stop and block this bill from proceeding.”
The Medicaid provisions in the bill, which include new work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, could put health coverage at risk for nearly 200,000 Coloradans, Hickenlooper said. That estimate ranges from about 150,000 to 250,000. A recent analysis from the state’s Office of State Planning and Budget predicts a loss of $1 billion in health care funding due to the bill, and state budget writers warn that Colorado could not absorb the loss.

Hickenlooper and others said they specifically want to see an exemption in the bill for rural health care centers, clinics and hospitals. He noted a handful of Colorado hospitals that are already labeled as high risk for closure.
“It’s going to take a trillion dollars out of the health care system,” said Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who represents Colorado’s 6th Congressional District. “Even if folks are saying ‘I’m not on Medicaid. Why does this impact me? I have the Cadillac program through my employer. What difference will this make?’ You can’t take a trillion dollars out of the American health care system and not have hospital closures, clinic closures, doctors and nurses leaving the system.”
There is some money set aside in the bill to partially compensate rural hospitals.
Mitzi Moran, the CEO of Sunrise Community Health in Greeley, said that the bill could put 11,000, or about one-quarter, of their patients at risk of losing coverage.
Joe Theine, the CEO of Southwest Health System in Cortez, said that about 25% of their total cash comes from Medicaid, including $9 million through provider taxes that enable Colorado to claim more federal money. Southwest Health System is one of the only critical-access hospitals in the region and delivers primary care to nearly 9,000 people in those counties.
Democratic leaders also denounced the bill’s cuts to nutrition programs and reduction in clean energy infrastructure investments.
“This was a major step toward addressing climate change, and now it’s like running into a brick wall,” Hickenlooper said.
On Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the state Legislature wrote to Colorado’s four Republican members of Congress urging them to vote against the bill. In addition to highlighting the risk to Medicaid and nutrition spending, they warned of the potential need to reduce funding for the state’s Department of Corrections, increase higher education tuition, limit the senior and veteran homestead exemption for property taxes, and cut state tax credits for families.
“While we understand that you do not need to balance the federal budget — as demonstrated by your votes for this bill that will increase the deficit by trillions of dollars — we do balance our budgets in Colorado,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, Majority Leader Monica Duran, Rep. Emily Sirota and Rep. Shannon Bird wrote.
“We have had to make hard choices in the last year to protect core services for hardworking families, and we will have to make many more in the year ahead. However, the choices this bill will force us to make are far worse and will be devastating for our state. Vote no.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Wednesday she will not run for governor in 2026 — an unexpected decision for some Iowans who thought she would be a top Republican contender in the race to fill Gov. Kim Reynolds’ seat.
Shortly after Reynolds announced she would not seek reelection following her current term, Bird released a statement saying she and her husband would “pray and consider what this decision means for our future.”
Bird was considered a high-profile potential pick for the GOP gubernatorial nominee, having strong ties to President Donald Trump from his time in the state during the Iowa caucuses. Trump told Iowans in January 2024 that Bird will “be your governor someday, I predict.” She posted a video on X in May, featuring this comment, alongside other clips of Trump praising the Iowa AG, with the caption “Someday…”
But on Wednesday, Bird officially ruled out a bid for governor in the 2026 election, instead saying she plans to run for reelection as attorney general.
“I am absolutely determined to do justice and hold this office to prevent it from being occupied by a radical, progressive Democrat who would undo all we’ve accomplished,” Bird said in a statement. “… Between now and next November, I will run a fierce reelection campaign, and I will will.”
During her time since taking office after the 2022 election when she defeated longtime former Attorney General Tom Miller, a Democrat, Bird said her office has accomplished “big victories” on issues like supporting crime victims and law enforcement and defending constitutional rights.
As she plans to run again as AG, she thanked people who encouraged her to run for governor, and said she plans to work to elect Republicans in 2026.
“I will also enthusiastically support our Republican nominee for Governor and the entire Republican ticket here in Iowa — our party will be unified,” Bird said. “I remain grateful for the opportunity to serve Iowans as their Attorney General, and I look forward to earning their support again.”
Bird is not the only Republican potential gubernatorial candidate who has tapped out of the race. Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley announced in late June he will run again for the Iowa House after earlier indicating he was not ruling out a gubernatorial bid. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig also said in May he will not run for governor but instead run again as agriculture secretary.
There are still several Republicans who are moving forward with gubernatorial runs. Iowa Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have launched campaigns for governor, while U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and state Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, have launched “exploratory” committees for a gubernatorial run.
Bousselot released a statement Wednesday applauding Bird’s work in the AG’s office and saying he supported her decision to run again for the position. He also said Iowa Republicans need a full ticket in 2026 that will “fight aggressively for an Iowa First Agenda that complements President Trump’s America First Agenda.”
“I have been proud to fight for that agenda in the Legislature – lower taxes, bringing manufacturing jobs back to Iowa, and standing firm against extremists who want to raise our taxes so the government can spend more, allow men in girls sports, and who don’t support border policies that keep our communities safe,” Bousselot said. “I have been sharing my perspective with voters around the state, listening to feedback from Iowans, and am laying the groundwork for a potential campaign for Governor next year.”
Democrats including Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and former political operative Julie Stauch have also launched 2026 campaigns for governor.
There is also a Democrat who has announced plans to run for attorney general in 2026. Nate Willems, a lawyer and former state representative, launched his campaign for attorney general in May. Willems released a statement Wednesday saying Iowans are ready to remove Bird from the AG’s office in the upcoming election.
“Iowans are tired of watching Brenna Bird dismantle the integrity of this office and turn it into a mouthpiece for an extreme political agenda,” Willems said in a statement. “Instead of protecting Iowans she has come after our most vulnerable neighbors, including children with disabilities, senior citizens, and sexual assault survivors, all to build her own national profile. It’s time to turn the page and get the attorney general’s office focused on helping the people of Iowa.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/birdabortion1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, who secured a settlement with the city and the state in 2017 to replace all of Flint’s lead lines, acknowledged that more than eight years later, the state had replaced nearly 11,000 pipes and restored more than 28,000 properties. 
In 2014, the city switched its water supply from water piped in from Detroit to the Flint River, a decision made by emergency managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder as a cost-saving move. Due to inadequate treatment of the water, corroding pipes leached lead into thousands of homes as residents raised concerns about discolored, foul-smelling and tasting water.
Bonsitu Kitaba, the interim legal director of the ACLU of Michigan, who worked with the city council to secure the settlement, credited the citizens of Flint for Tuesday’s milestone, emphasizing the efforts residents made to ensure the city and the state fulfilled their obligations.
“Residents of Flint deserve – and have always deserved – access to clean, safe drinking water and property repairs, full stop. While we know that this is not a resolution for all the harms caused to the people of Flint from the water crisis, we celebrate this long-awaited win alongside you. We are committed to our partnership and the work ahead,” Kitaba said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the initial deadline for the settlement was set for 2020, Flint residents repeatedly found themselves back in court, with federal judge David M. Lawson in 2024 declaring Flint in contempt of a previous court order requiring the city to hit certain milestones in replacing lead pipes. 
However, the state’s final progress report does not mark the end of the city’s obligations, as several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes and some residents have declined to have their pipes tested or replaced. 
During a celebration in May marking the completion of the program, Kitaba noted that the city is still required to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Flint has also committed to replacing any remaining lead lines this year, with Kitaba encouraging residents with lead lines to call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.
The council stressed there is no safe level of lead exposure. 
Pastor Allen Overton of Concerned Pastors for Social Action cheered his fellow community members, crediting their work to hold elected leaders accountable as the reason behind Tuesday’s milestone.
“Thanks to the persistence of the people of Flint and our partners, we are finally at the end of the lead pipe replacement project. While this milestone is not all the justice our community deserves, it is a huge achievement,” Overton said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lead-pipes-enviromental-justice.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr picked South Dakota as the place to unveil what he called a “Build America Agenda,” aimed at cutting regulations and revitalizing the telecommunications industry.
Carr delivered a speech Wednesday at the wireless infrastructure construction company VIKOR, surrounded by construction workers, American flags and Toby Keith country music playing from loudspeakers.
Before the event, Carr climbed a 200-foot KELO-TV tower. At the event, he wore and handed out red hats emblazoned with the slogan “Make Towers Great Again,” similar to hats at President Donald Trump’s political rallies that say “Make America Great Again.” 
Inflation drives up cost of broadband internet projects

South Dakota, Carr said, symbolizes what’s possible when “we get our regulatory policies right.”
“I imagine that the ‘other S.F.’ — San Francisco — might seem like a more natural pick to most when outlining a tech or telecom agenda,” Carr said. “But I can’t think of a more appropriate place for me to announce the agenda that will guide much of the FCC’s upcoming work than right here in the real S.F.”
Carr was originally nominated to the FCC by Trump in 2017, and then renominated by President Joe Biden in 2023 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate both times. This year, Trump picked Carr to serve as FCC chairman.
 Prior to Trump’s election win last year, Carr authored a chapter about the FCC in the controversial Project 2025 report, a policy roadmap for a second Trump term published by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
On Wednesday, Carr praised Trump’s second-term priorities and Republican leadership in South Dakota, including Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Carr previously joined Thune to visit a broadband internet construction site in Colton in June 2023, spotlighting the value of federal investments in internet infrastructure.



Speech highlights
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr announced several goals of his Build America Agenda, including:

Accelerating the shift from aging copper lines to high-speed internet.
Encouraging greater collaboration and more concrete timelines to fix “slow, cumbersome” delays when telecom crews are stringing new fiber-optic lines across utility poles.
Using legal powers to override local siting delays and permit faster infrastructure deployment.
Revisiting how the FCC complies with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), in light of recent Supreme Court rulings relaxing requirements for environmental review.
Selling off unused airwaves that companies can use to build new wireless networks. 
Eliminating rules slowing the space satellite industry, to “inject rocket fuel into our licensing process by standardizing our reviews through more objective metrics.”
Eliminating decades-old rules governing outdated technologies like telegraphs and phone booths.
Implementing workforce reforms aimed at “making it harder for foreign, fly-by-night crews to sweep in and undercut the safety and security of our networks.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) is asking a state court to block an attempt by a fired firefighter who leads the union representing workers at T.F. Green International Airport to get his job back — a move that appeared to catch him by surprise.
Airport officials filed a lawsuit against Steven Parent on Wednesday in Providence County Superior Court, citing allegations he trespassed into the T.F. Green fire station on Nov. 1, 2024, four days after being fired.
Parent, who worked at T.F. Green for more than a decade, has been president of Local 2873 of RI Council 94 for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) since 2019. The union represents airport police officers, firefighters, airfield maintenance, building maintenance, operations and clerical staff.
An arbitration hearing on an unfair labor practice Parent filed against RIAC is scheduled for some time in August after being delayed twice. He is seeking reinstatement as a fire lieutenant after being fired on Oct. 28 after airport officials claimed he discouraged people from applying for jobs at the Warwick airport while benefiting from overtime pay caused by ongoing vacancies. Upon his termination, airport officials immediately revoked Parent’s security credentials and informed him he was no longer permitted in secure areas of the airport.
The legal action was news to Parent when reached for comment by phone Wednesday morning. He said he had yet to be served any papers.
“They’re suing me?” he said. “I was not aware of any of this — I was just there Monday.”
RIAC claims Parent never returned his deactivated badge as required under the federal government’s Airport Security Program.
Four days after his firing, Parent entered the airport’s fire station — which RIAC claims is a secured area — without an escort. 
“Mr. Parent’s unauthorized access caused alarm among airport employees,” the lawsuit claims.
The fire station is located opposite the airfield, and has a gated entrance along Cedar Swamp Road in Warwick near Winslow Park.
According to airport officials, Parent used an intercom to ask the on-duty firefighter — one of his former subordinates to open the gate remotely for him, the lawsuit states. Parent was reportedly confronted by the airport’s deputy fire chief and told to leave, but Parent allegedly flipped him off.
Parent denied his interaction was uncivil and said he had called the station ahead of his arrival.
“I had no issue with the deputy chief — I wasn’t being disciplined for anything at the fire station,” Parent said.

Airport officials said Parent took work material without authorization following his firing. Parent said he retrieved a copy of the union’s contract. At the time union officials and RIAC were in the midst of negotiating a new contract for airport workers, which was eventually ratified in March 2025.
“RIAC’s filing speaks for itself,” Duc Nguyen, the airport’s senior vice president of operations,  said in a statement. “This action is to confirm RIAC’s authority to determine eligibility for security credentials consistent with federal requirements and its duty to ensure the safety and security of the airport and traveling public.”
Council 94 President Michael McDonald said he too was caught by surprise by the filing, but that legal action was not totally unexpected. He called the lawsuit a last resort by airport officials to avoid arbitration with Parent over an unfair labor practice, which is scheduled to happen some time in August.
“They’re trying to avoid answering for what they’ve done,” McDonald said in an interview. 
Parent said arbitration was first scheduled for February, but was delayed to June and is now pushed to August.










They’re suing me? I was not aware of any of this — I was just there Monday.

But a statement issued by RIAC Wednesday claims the arbitration process is limited to addressing whether Parent was wrongfully terminated, not to resolve any legal nuances. The lawsuit argues that even if Parent were reinstated, his alleged security breach would prevent him from regaining clearance, making him ineligible to serve at the fire station.
If the court blocks Parent’s reinstatement, RIAC argues that airport officials can move forward with filling his vacant lieutenant position. The position is not posted on RIAC’s job portal. But Parent said two candidates have already applied and recently took written tests for the role — tests he observed.
“I pretty much encouraged everyone there to apply,” he said.
RIAC is asking the court to uphold officials’ decision to revoke Parent’s credentials.
McDonald said the union will continue to fight for Parent as the legal process plays out.
“We’ll stop at nothing to defend Steve, he’s our local president — as we would for any member of Rhode Island Council 94 who’s been treated in this manner,” McDonald said. “We are confident that once this all settles, we will prevail.”

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico health officials confirmed an additional eight cases of measles in the Luna County Detention Center Wednesday, bringing the total to 13 — 12 people in the jail and one staff member.
Last week, five detainees tested positive for measles, but an additional eight people displayed symptoms, New Mexico Department of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source NM. Two more cases are pending.
The latest case was reported in Luna County on June 26, 2025, and Smelser said lags may occur between determining cases and publicly confirming them.
“We focus on disease control first, trying to prevent the spread of the infection, so we might be a little slower in our communication,” he said.
NMDOH offered vaccinations for 400 detainees and nearly 100 staff, and provided “more than 100 vaccines” in the last week, Smelser said, noting jail officials’ “incredible cooperation” in working to prevent further spread.
Measles, one of the most contagious airborne viruses, spreads through contact with droplets from an infected person’ coughs and sneezes. The virus can survive in the air for hours, and can spread days before and after symptoms appear. Additionally, patients can take one to three weeks to develop symptoms such as headache, fever, cough, red eyes and the spotty red rash.
All 12 people exposed to measles were placed in a designated pod and quarantined until several days after symptoms faded, according to Pablo Montoya, the director of public safety at the detention center. Currently, two people remain quarantined.
Staff were given masks, gloves and gowns to prevent spread, Montoya said. The facility does not staff to be vaccinated, he said.
In total, New Mexico has recorded 94 cases of measles in eight counties since the mid-February outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, first crossed the state line, with cases in Lea, San Juan, Curry, Eddy, Doña Ana, Chaves and Sandoval counties.
Health officials say two doses of the measles vaccine prevents spread, or lessens the severity of an infection. The state is offering dozens of clinics across the state, which can be found on the measles webpage.

(Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)A federal appeals court has ruled against a Florida teacher who challenged a state law forbidding transgender teachers from using their preferred pronouns during their official duties in the classroom.
The case involves Katie Wood, a math teacher in Hillsborough County who is transgender. She sued the state after a 2023 law passed saying that employees of public schools may not identify to their students with pronouns not consistent with their birth sex, “an immutable biological trait.”
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Wood. The majority considered whether her speech or pronoun use while interacting with students inside the classroom is private speech or within the scope of employment.
“Given the statute’s relatively limited sweep and, even more so, the narrowness of Wood’s challenge, this is, we think, a straightforward case,” Judge Kevin Newsom wrote in a 14-page opinion. “When a public-school teacher addresses her students within the four walls of a classroom — whether orally or in writing — she is unquestionably acting ‘pursuant to [her] official duties.'”
Wood argued the law violated her First Amendment rights and that use of he/him pronouns would induce emotional harm, risk physical harm, and disrupt the classroom, while avoiding titles and pronouns would be “impractical, disruptive, and stigmatizing.”
District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee, appointed by former President Barack Obama, had ruled at trial that it was “substantially likely” the law violated Wood’s speech rights and issued a preliminary injunction.  
Transgender teachers get a court date in challenge to FL’s misgendering law

The appeal court vacated that injunction. 
The majority found that Wood was acting as teacher, rather than as a private citizen, when writing her pronouns on the whiteboard and syllabi, wearing a pin with her pronouns, and providing her pronouns verbally. 
“We hold that the district court misapplied the law, and thus abused its discretion, in preliminarily enjoining [the law’s] enforcement against Wood. We therefore vacate the district court’s order and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion,” Newsom wrote. 
The 2023 law was among bills expanding the Parental Rights in Education Act, also known as “Don’t Say Gay,” from the year before. The bills aim to restrict mention of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools.
“And because Wood can’t show a likelihood of success on her First Amendment claim, we needn’t address any of the remaining preliminary-injunction factors,” Newsom wrote.

Dissent
In a dissenting opinion, Judge Adalberto Jordan wrote that pronouns and personal titles for a teacher are, “like her name, significant markers of individual identity.”
“They exist outside of, and do not depend on, the school or the government for their existence. Stated differently, Ms. Wood would still have her own preferred personal title and pronouns, and would still use them to identify herself to others, even if she was not a public school teacher,” Jordan wrote. 
It’s not clear that the First Amendment claim brought by Woods should fail, Jordan said. 
“We should be wary of holding that everything that happens in a classroom constitutes government speech outside the ambit of the First Amendment,” Jordan wrote. “Those who wield the power of the government today and are on one side of the gender and culture wars will be the ones at risk of being compelled to speak against their beliefs, or silenced, when their opponents are in charge. Today’s opinion will then not look as attractive.”
Jordan doubted, as did the trial court, that high school students “would view her preferred personal title and pronouns as Florida’s endorsement of her being transgender.”
Jordan was appointed by Obama, and Newsom was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, as was Judge Andrew Brasher, who sided with Newsom.

The department announced the settlement with Villa Financial Services LLC and Villa Olympia Investment LLC on Wednesday. The facilities in question include Villa’s Ambassador, Father Murray, Imperial, Regency, St. Joseph’s and Westland locations.
Villa has denied the allegations but agreed to the settlement announced Wednesday.
“Chronic neglect of nursing home residents is absolutely unacceptable, yet sadly all too common,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement.  “American taxpayers contribute billions every year to ensure quality care for our most vulnerable. When that care is not provided, my office will continue to work alongside our federal partners to hold those responsible accountable.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Villa will pay $3.41 million to the U.S. government as part of the settlement and $1.08 million to the state of Michigan, the department said.
The department’s Health Care Fraud Division handled the case, which is a federally certified Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for the state, which received 75% of its funding from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant of $5.7 million in 2025. The investigation also included involvement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.
A whistleblower complaint from Villa employees jumpstarted the inquiry, as employees claimed they personally witnessed the mistreatment of residents. It was alleged that the nursing homes failed to sufficiently staff the facilities, prevent and treat infections, prevent falls, and failed to provide toileting needs that resulted in residents sitting in or laying in soiled beds or clothes for long periods of time.
The facilities also failed to prevent pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores.
Villa must also enter into a five-year quality-of-care Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. DHHS and its Office of Inspector General. The agreement requires the companies to retain an independent quality monitor to review their provision of care and their ability to detect and respond to patient care issues.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1358903157-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

ARTICLE SUMMARY:

Illinois closed fiscal year 2025 with record $54 billion in revenue.
While that marked a surplus from the enacted budget, the extra revenue was anticipated when lawmakers approved the current-year budget in May.
It doesn’t give lawmakers any extra breathing room for an expected volatile fiscal year 2026.



Despite uncertainty over the economy and federal funding during the second half of fiscal year 2025, the year closed on June 30 with the state setting a new record for annual revenue.

Numbers compiled by the independent Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability show FY25 concluded with $54 billion in revenue, the most the state has ever received in a fiscal year. The state also brought in $717 million more in revenue than lawmakers originally budgeted for when they passed a $53.3 billion budget in May 2024.

All told, the final revenue numbers track closely with projections made in May by both COGFA and the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget that formed the basis of the FY26 budget. In other words, June revenues produced no surprises, and lawmakers aren’t sitting on any substantial surplus as the new fiscal year begins.

The record revenues also don’t alleviate any uncertainty for the current or future fiscal years as Congress considers drastic reductions to the social safety net and aid to states.

Causes of revenue growth

Strong personal income tax growth drove the revenue increase in FY25, largely thanks to a “true up” conducted by the Department of Revenue that reallocated business related income tax revenue into the personal income tax category. Personal income tax revenue was 10% higher than in FY24, but corporate income taxes declined by 9.5%.

Some other revenue sources also saw minimal growth. Sales tax revenue grew by less than 1%, though COGFA noted it increased by nearly 3% in the second half of FY25 after a weak start last summer as gas prices dropped and people cut back on large purchases amid growing economic uncertainty.

Federal income was also down 4.6% in FY25, even when excluding one-time pandemic relief funds the state received in FY24. But in a bright spot for the state, COGFA found that state revenue sources grew more than anticipated to offset the $178 million decline in federal revenue.

Despite solid revenue growth this year, questions remain about how well it will perform in FY26.

“Whether this record will be surpassed in FY 2026 remains to be seen, though the FY 2026 enacted budget assumes revenues of $55.297 billion – nearly $1.3 billion above the FY 2025 final total,” COGFA Revenue Manger Eric Noggle wrote.

Bills paid and money left over

The state also ended the fiscal year with $1.9 billion of cash in the General Revenue Fund after all bills were paid, according to the Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s office.

“We work hard each year to pay bills on time, build up the state’s emergency reserves and stress fiscal discipline, even in these uncertain times,” Mendoza said in a statement. “My office will strive for continued improvement in state finances and credit ratings in the new budget year.”

Mendoza's office also put $256 million into the “rainy day” fund, growing it to a balance of $2.5 billion. The fund is expected to grow at a slower rate in FY26, however, as lawmakers suspended a monthly transfer that will free up $45 million.

With an extra cash balance to start the new fiscal year, Mendoza said she plans to pre-pay monthly pension payments for FY26. Lawmakers gave the comptroller authority last year to make pension payments earlier in the year rather than on a monthly basis when extra money is available.

“This will enable the systems to plan accordingly and keep additional dollars in their investment portfolios into the new budget year,” Mendoza said.

An uncertain future

With good new concluding FY25, attention now turns to FY26, which began Tuesday, and the vast uncertainty the state faces from budget talks in Congress and the economic fallout of decisions by the Trump administration.

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a $55.1 billion spending plan in mid-June that relies on $55.3 billion in revenue. It’s the largest budget in state history despite minimal discretionary spending growth, and it relies on $1.2 billion of tax increases or one-time revenues.

But state lawmakers have left the door open to the possibility that changes Congress makes to federal funding that requires states to cover greater portions of government programs and ceases funding in certain areas will require lawmakers to change the budget.

“The ability of the state to try to step in and try to mitigate the damage is somewhat limited, although we have the ability to do certain things and may have to in special session or we may have to in veto session,” Pritzker told reporters in Peoria on Tuesday. “It’s a little hard to tell yet. Some of the provisions of this terrible bill in Washington, D.C. don’t go into effect until next year and so we’ll have to evaluate what changes to make in order to deal with it.”

Work requirements for health care and food assistance programs, cuts to Medicaid reimbursements and the elimination of clean energy tax credits could all require the state to take on more costs.

,DC,2025-07-02 20:27:28+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump dealt loss as judge rejects executive order claiming 'invasion' at the border,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-dealt-loss-judge-rejects-executive-order-claiming-invasion-border,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge Wednesday ruled as unlawful an executive order by President Donald Trump that barred asylum by claiming an “invasion” at the southern border and the need to protect states.It’s the first major blow to the Trump administration in its attempt to end the ability for asylum seekers to make asylum claims.“The President cannot adopt an alternative immigration system, which supplants the statutes that Congress has enacted,” District of Columbia U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrote in his opinion.“Here, nothing in the (Immigration and Nationality Act) or the Constitution grants the President or his delegees the sweeping authority asserted in the Proclamation and implementing guidance,” continued Moss, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.The order from Moss also prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from enforcing the executive order.He also agreed to certify a class for potential asylum-seekers, which comes after last week's Supreme Court ruling that curtailed nationwide injunctions from lower courts. Certifying a class was suggested by the court to give judges an avenue to make an order broader.Moss put his order on hold for 14 days, to give the Trump administration time to appeal his ruling. If the order is upheld by an appeals court and the Supreme Court, it would require the Trump administration to begin processing asylum applicants for migrants.“(The executive order) is unlawful insofar as it purports to suspend or to restrict access to asylum, withholding of removal, or the existing regulatory processes for obtaining (Convention Against Torture) protection,” Moss wrote in his order.Inauguration DayThe asylum order was one of several immigration-related executive orders that Trump signed on the Inauguration Day of his second term. The order proclaimed that the “current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion” and barred asylum-seekers from being able to claim asylum.Trump characterized asylum-seekers seeking entry at the U.S.-Mexico border as an “invasion” and said that the states need “protection,” so the White House would suspend physical entry until the president deemed the “invasion” over.Encounters at the southern border have been the lowest in several years.The section Trump cited in his proclamation, section 212(f), is part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under that section, the president has the authority to “suspend the entry” of people who are not U.S. citizens under certain circumstances.Complaint filed in FebruaryThe suit from the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal organizations, on behalf of Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, and other immigration legal service providers, argued the executive order unlawfully denies asylum and other humanitarian protections that are ""expressly granted by Congress.""“It is returning asylum seekers—not just single adults, but families too—to countries where they face persecution or torture, without allowing them to invoke the protections Congress has provided,” according to the initial complaint filed in February. “Indeed, the Proclamation does not even exempt unaccompanied children, despite the specific protections such children receive by statute.”RAICES, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Florence Immigrant And Refugee Rights Project, which provide legal services to immigrants, argued that the proclamation harms the legal aid work of the individual plaintiffs.Those individual plaintiffs in the suit include people who allege they fled persecution in Afghanistan, Ecuador, Cuba, Egypt, Brazil, Turkey and Peru. Some plaintiffs have either been removed to their home country, or to a third country such as Panama, according to the filing.",,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded.
On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Idaho will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with.
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028.
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases.
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended to 1990.

 U.S. senators put support behind RECA reauthorization

RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a press release that he negotiated the inclusion of Idaho victims in the final language of the bill.
“Many Idahoans have died or suffered as a result of cancer related to fallout from 1950s to 1960s Cold War-era above-ground nuclear weapons testing with no recompense,” Crapo said in the release. “Idahoans have been unfairly left out of the RECA program for far too many years. The Senate’s passage of language to include Idaho in the program marks one step closer to ensuring affected Idahoans will finally start to receive the compensation they rightfully deserve. I urge the U.S. House of Representatives to preserve this provision.”
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985.
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.”
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.

U.S. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) attended several events in Las Cruces. The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded.
On Tuesday, Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in New Mexico will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with.
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of New Mexico, Utah and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028.
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases.
Uranium miners and workers based in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended to 1990.

“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”
RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation. The New Mexico delegation and radiation survivors marked the anniversary of its expiration by renewing calls for RECA’s expansion.

The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.

Last year, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján teamed up with Hawley to sponsor a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
In mid-June, when Hawley re-introduced the measure into the GOP budget bill, the delegation responded by noting, in part, that the measure has previously garnered bipartisan support.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, also noted in a statement provided to Source that over the years of fighting for RECA, the state’s delegation and the advocates have “built a broad coalition grounded in justice and science, yet Republican leadership refused to pass our bill and the program lapsed last year. Since then, people have been dying while Republican leadership in the House drags its feet. However, even a broken clock is right twice a day. While the broader Billionaires Budget Bill is deeply harmful in many ways, we are glad some Republicans are finally recognizing the value of RECA. New Mexicans have waited long enough. They deserve the compensation and recognition they’ve earned through pain and sacrifice.”
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.
Correction: A previous version reported uranium workers in South Dakota, North Dakota, Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Texas were not covered under RECA. While these states were not covered in the initial version of the bill, it was expanded in 2000 to included these states.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s latest scholarship program for K-12 private tuition and other expenses reached its cap of 10,000 students for the year, according to the state Department of Education.
That’s more than triple the number enrolled last year, when just under half of the initial program’s 5,000 slots went unfilled even before classes started.
And of those 2,880 students accepted, as many as 1,000 were removed after payments went out for failing to meet eligibility requirements, according to estimates from the Education Oversight Committee.
But under the law signed in May, income eligibility expanded for the coming school year. Families’ qualifying income can reach up to 300% of the federal poverty level this school year, instead of 200%. For a family of four, for example, incomes max out at $96,450, up from $62,400.
That opened the door for a greater number of students to receive the $7,500 annual scholarships, doled out in four quarterly payments that start this month.
“This is an exciting milestone in South Carolina’s education freedom journey,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “This program puts hardworking families in the driver’s seat — empowering them to shape an education as unique as their child.”
K-12 education voucher bill headed to SC governor’s desk

The 10,000 students enrolled for 2025-26 include 1,691 students who participated in the program last year.
The department did not provide a breakdown of student demographics, such as age, race and geographic location, or the reasons applications were rejected.
So far, applications for 16,119 students were submitted; 2,819 of them were rejected, and 4,991 applications remain under review, said agency spokesman Jason Raven.
If they’re found eligible, those students will be put on a waitlist to either take over any spots that open up this year or be among the first to get dibs when the application window opens again next year — when eligibility expands again.
Under the law, up to 15,000 students qualify for 2026-27, when parents’ incomes don’t cap out until reaching 500% of the federal poverty line. That’s $161,000 for a family of four under the latest guidelines (which are adjusted annually).
If more than 15,000 students apply, legislators have the option of funding additional scholarships by putting more money in the state budget.
This year’s increase in students accepted has several possible explanations, Raven said.
For one, legislators did away with the deadline to apply, which was the primary reason the department rejected applications last year. Nearly 80% of the 5,027 applications rejected ahead of the 2024-2025 school year were because parents missed the deadline or failed to complete all the necessary paperwork, the department said at the time.
Palmetto Promise Institute, which spent years lobbying for the school choice program, also redoubled its efforts to help parents sign up, offering a webinar explaining the program as well as one-on-one support for parents with questions, said Felicity Ropp, who leads the conservative think tank’s information hub on school choice.
Another likely reason for the increase, Raven said, was a renewed spotlight on the program as the House and Senate debated and ultimately passed a law meant to get private schools back on the list of providers after the state Supreme Court’s ruling last September.
In a split decision, justices said K-12 private tuition payments violated the state constitution’s ban on taxpayer money directly benefiting private education, requiring private schools to be immediately removed from the list of providers eligible for scholarship money. GOP legislators designed the new law to get around that ban.
Another potential explanation for the increase is a new provision allowing families already using open enrollment programs at traditional public schools to participate, said Patrick Kelly with the Palmetto State Teachers Association. Students attending a school other than the one for which they are zoned, including a different public school, can use the money for various expenses including tutoring, textbooks and computers.
Up to 1,000 ineligible SC students booted from voucher program, report finds

How many of the enrolled students can use their scholarship for private tuition in the coming school year remains to be seen.
The state’s high court will ultimately decide whether tuition payments under the new law are constitutional, as another lawsuit is expected ahead of classes starting.
The compromise that Republicans in both chambers agreed to combined parts of the House and Senate versions of the legislation. Following the Senate’s suggestion, legislators used lottery revenue to cover $20 million of the $75 million the program will need this year. Keeping with the House’s proposal, the law requires Weaver to hire a “trustee” to oversee fund distribution, which will begin at the end of the month.
Supporters of the program said the cap being hit showed a high demand for the payments.
“These robust application numbers show how excited South Carolina parents are to have opportunity and choice in their children’s education,” Ropp said.
Critics remain unconvinced.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, called the law a “blatant disregard for our constitution by those who are sworn to uphold it.”
“Funds that could be used for other state agencies are being diverted to private schools that pick and choose who they educate,” East said in a statement. “If they take state money, they should play by the same rules.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/school-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)With roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding at stake, Congress is racing to finalize a sweeping budget package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” ahead of President Donald Trump’s July 4 deadline — but key decisions about cuts to the health care program remain up in the air.
A preliminary review by the Congressional Budget Office has heightened concern, and a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers and hospital associations across several states is warning against adopting the Senate version of the bill, which they say could devastate Medicaid-dependent health systems.
The overall package, which calls for cuts to several federal social aid programs, is meant to extend overall tax cuts from Trump’s first presidential term, while boosting U.S. border and military spending. 
Although the House already passed its version in June, the Senate version only advanced this week after Vice President JD Vance cast a tie-breaking vote, following opposition from three Republican senators who sided with Democrats. 
A central dispute between the two chambers involves how the Senate version would restructure Medicaid funding, particularly in ways that could undercut Virginia’s hospitals and the state’s expanded Medicaid program. 
“Given the available options, the U.S. House reconciliation legislation is the better approach to accomplish the President’s tax-cutting objectives while still preserving our health care delivery system and health safety net,” wrote Julian Walker, vice president of communications for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. “For the sake of public health, well-being, and the economy, we urge members of the House to reject the Senate plan and insist on their version of the package.”
He added that the association is “deeply disturbed” by the Senate version. 
Last week, Virginia joined hospital associations in 13 states in signing a joint letter opposing the Senate’s proposal. Walker has previously warned that rural hospitals would be hit hardest, likely forced into closures or deep cuts into service and staffing. 
While the House version avoids the same blow to hospital funding mechanisms, it still has Medicaid changes that Democrats, healthcare advocates and many Virginians have criticized. 
Both versions of the bill include new work and authorization requirements for Medicaid recipients.Though most Medicaid beneficiaries already work, some rely on it when temporarily unable to do so — such as Richmond-area construction worker Andrew Daughtry, who is recovering from an injury, and the daughter of Aida Pachecho, who is unemployed while battling breast cancer. 
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said during a recent press call that the additional authorization requirements could overwhelm already burdened government employees. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia introduced amendments to protect Medicaid before the Senate bill passed, but those efforts fell short. 
Despite concerns, Virginia’s House Republicans continue to back their chamber’s version of the bill, claiming it meets Trump’s goals without gutting Medicaid. Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, signed onto a joint letter with other lawmakers last week. 
“The House’s approach reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard, and we urge that it be retained in the final bill,” they wrote. “Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers.”
Medicaid’s size as a share of the federal budget has made it a prime target for Republicans looking to trim or redirect spending. Wittman and Kiggans argue the reforms will ultimately strengthen coverage for pregnant people, children and disabled Americans.

In a recent newsletter, Kiggans called the bill “historic,” describing it as a tool to “rein in Washington’s waste” and deliver on promises made by Trump and Congressional Republicans.
Wittman, who has spoken about being adopted thanks to Medicaid coverage at birth, emphasized his personal connection to the program.
“I know firsthand what access to care means for families like mine,” he said in a recent statement. 
But Virginia Democrats argue that Wittman and Kiggans have already done damage by supporting even partial cuts. 
Democratic Party of Virginia chair Lamont Bagby said in a recent statement that the two representatives “already broke their promise to Virginians by voting to advance this disastrous budget that makes the largest cuts to Medicaid in history.”
He questioned whether the two Republicans would “once again bend the knee to Trump” or stand with their constituents.

The GR2 Foundation: Grambling Research and Resource Foundation is a nonprofit entity separate from Grambling State that will support the university’s academics through philanthropic fundraising. Many other universities already work with similar foundations for this. 
“GR2 is the engine behind our next chapter,” said Grambling President Martin Lemelle. “As we rise toward R2 status, we are laying the groundwork for a stronger, smarter, and more sustainable Grambling State.” 
The Carnegie Classification of Institutes of Higher Education recognizes three levels of research institutions: “R1” or “R2,” meaning they are doctoral degree-granting institutions with either “very high” or “high” levels of research activity and “Research Colleges and Universities,” which goes to schools who spend at least $2.5 million annually on research, regardless of whether they confer doctoral degrees. 
To obtain R2 status, Grambling will need to spend $5 million annually on research and confer at least 20 doctorate degrees. 
Research spending at Grambling has decreased every year since 2017, when it spent $5.9 million on research. In 2023, the most recent year in which data is available, Grambling spent less than $500,000 on research, and does not presently have a research ranking. 
Grambling has recently secured over $12 million in research funding, according to a university press release, including $7 million from the National Science Foundation. 
Theodore Callier, Grambling’s vice president for research, said launching the foundation will allow the university to scale its success in securing external funding. 
Louisiana’s other R2 institutions include Southern University, one of the 13 HBCUs with the designation, Louisiana Tech, the University of New Orleans and LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans. 
Louisiana’s R1 universities are LSU, Tulane and the University of Louisiana Lafayette. 

Xavier University of Louisiana, University of Louisiana Monroe, Southeastern Louisiana University and LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport are designated as “research colleges and universities.”

Free.,US House GOP struggles to advance megabill against  Freedom Caucus resistance,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-struggles-advance-megabill-against-freedom-caucus-resistance,,"WASHINGTON —  U.S. House Republican efforts to pass the “big, beautiful bill” hit a roadblock Wednesday, when leaders left the chamber in a holding pattern for hours before sending members back to their offices.The House was scheduled to vote on a rule that would have set up floor debate and a final passage vote for the tax break and spending cut package. But that plan was delayed indefinitely after GOP leaders had to hold open another vote as they tried to secure the votes needed to move forward amid an especially thin 220-212 majority.Far-right members of the House GOP objected strongly to the Senate version passed Tuesday, which reflected changes made during the past month compared to an earlier version passed in the House. Members of the House Freedom Caucus cited provisions dealing with immigration and the repeal of clean energy tax credits, as well as the measure’s increase in the deficit.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released analysis after the Senate voted, showing the bill would increase deficits by $3.4 trillion during the next decade compared to current law.'We can't make everyone 100% happy'Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said just before walking onto the floor that he felt ​​”very positive about the progress” made during ongoing negotiations, but didn’t commit to having the necessary votes.""The thing about it is, when you have a piece of legislation that is this comprehensive and with so many agenda items involved, you're going to have lots of different priorities and preferences among people because they represent different districts and they have different interests,” Johnson said. “But we can't make everyone 100% happy. It's impossible.”Johnson said he would never ask lawmakers to “compromise core principles, but preferences must be yielded for the greater good.”South Dakota Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson told reporters before the delay that “the rule going down would be a very unfortunate development.”But he expressed confidence in Speaker Johnson’s ability to bring holdouts on board eventually, potentially by making commitments tied to future bills.""Speaker Johnson has not made any promises. He has been really good about talking about legislative vehicles that will exist in the months to come,” Dusty Johnson said. “Reconciliation is not the only tool in the Republican, or I should say in the congressional toolbox. Mike Johnson's done a good job of making people understand there are other ways we can get things done.”Trump presses House GOPSeveral House GOP lawmakers traveled to the White House earlier in the day to meet with President Donald Trump, who was working to assuage concerns through several social media posts.“THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL DEAL IS ALL ABOUT GROWTH. IF PASSED, AMERICA WILL HAVE AN ECONOMIC RENAISSANCE LIKE NEVER BEFORE,” Trump wrote. “IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING, JUST IN ANTICIPATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL BILL. DEFICIT CUT IN HALF, RECORD INVESTMENT — CASH, FACTORIES, JOBS POURING INTO THE USA. MAGA!!!”Further complicating matters were a few absences, since the House was set to be out of session this week and lawmakers experienced weather-related travel delays trying to get back to Capitol Hill. Many opted to rent cars and drive instead of trying to rebook canceled flights.But the bigger problem facing Speaker Johnson is that he cannot lose more than a handful of GOP votes and still pass the legislation. House Rules Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., urged support for approving the rule during floor debate, arguing it was essential for GOP lawmakers to deliver on campaign promises.“This legislation is the embodiment of the America First agenda and we would all do well to remember that,” Foxx said. “Failure at this critical juncture is not an option. This clock is ticking, the president and the American people are waiting. ""Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, ranking member on the panel, railed against the dozens of provisions Senate Republicans bundled together in the 870-page package, including some added just Tuesday.“This process — an abomination, legislative malpractice,” McGovern said. “Final text of this bill came out less than 24 hours ago. We met in committee an hour after it was posted and now we’re here considering a rule that only allows for one hour of debate.“This bill is within the jurisdiction of 12 different committees. One hour is ridiculous. And every minute we’re finding out new things that were snuck into the bill: a tax cut for whalers and now we’re learning about a gambling tax.”Tax cuts favor higher incomesThe bill — which underwent weeks of revisions in the Senate after a prior version barely passed the House in May — will extend and expand the 2017 GOP tax law while overhauling several safety-net programs and slashing spending on Medicaid.Those tax cuts skew toward wealthier income earners. The top 1% would receive a cut three times the size of those with incomes in the bottom 60% of after-tax income, according to analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It also makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs.The package makes substantial changes to Medicaid, including requiring some people on the program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.It will block any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year, essentially requiring enrollees to find other health care options for routine appointments such as cancer screenings, birth control and sexually transmitted infections treatment and screening. Using federal taxpayer dollars for abortion coverage has been restricted for decades, with limited exceptions.The legislation requires state governments to pay for a portion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for the first time if they cannot get error payment rates under a certain percentage. SNAP is the primary federal nutrition program that feeds low-income people and roughly 42 million rely on it.It bolsters spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, including line items for the “golden dome” missile defense system and additional barriers along the southern border.The measure would provide a substantial funding increase to federal immigration enforcement for detention and removal of people without permanent legal status, aiding the president in carrying out his campaign promise of mass deportations.The bill would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, a figure designed to get Congress past next year’s midterm elections before the country would once again bump up against the borrowing limit.Protesters milled about and held signs on street corners outside the U.S. Capitol as Republicans worked to pass the megabill. Several spoke out against cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, as well as rollbacks to clean energy tax credits contained in the budget reconciliation package.Senate turmoilThe House voted 215-214 mostly along party lines to approve the first version of the package in late May.Senate Republicans spent much of the last month reading through that, trying to determine what proposals their members supported and which elements would need to come out to comply with the strict rules that go along with writing a budget reconciliation bill.The parliamentarian, that chamber’s referee, continued to issue rulings on whether various policies in the legislation were in bounds for days before the Senate officially began debating the measure and even after they launched into vote-a-rama Monday morning.That “Byrd bath” process eventually wrapped up, allowing Senate GOP leaders to release updated text of the package shortly before the chamber took its final vote.Even with near-constant negotiations among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., was unable to get everyone on board.3 Senate Republicans voted noMaine Sen. Susan Collins, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis opposed the measure, which the Senate approved on Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.Collins wrote in a statement that while she supported “extending the tax relief for families and small businesses,” her opposition to the legislation “stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.”Collins also cited “additional problems” with how the legislation addressed tax credits for certain forms of energy production, which she wrote “should have been gradually phased out so as not to waste the work that has already been put into these innovative new projects and prevent them from being completed.”Tills spoke about his opposition to the bill’s changes to Medicaid during a floor speech before the Senate’s vote, arguing its cuts to spending to the state-federal health program for low-income people and some people with disabilities weren’t in the best interest of GOP voters.“I’m telling the president that you have been misinformed,” Tillis said. “You supporting the Senate mark will hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.”Tillis said he supports a policy change in the bill that would require people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program. But he was critical of other changes implemented by his Senate colleagues, and announced he won't seek reelection hours after voting against advancing the package.“I love the work requirement. I love the other reforms in this bill. They are necessary and I appreciate the leadership of the House for putting it in there,” Tillis said. “In fact, I like the work of the House so much that I wouldn’t be having to do this speech if we simply started with the House mark.”Paul said he decided to vote against the legislation because it will increase federal deficits during the next few years. “To me the most pertinent question is, how will the bill affect the deficit in the next year?” Paul said. “Currently our deficit is estimated to be a little under $2 trillion this year. What will happen to the (deficit) in 2026 if this bill passes? Well, using the math most favorable to the supporters of the bill, referred to as the policy baseline, the deficit in 2026 will still be $270 billion more than this year.”Paul added “that’s just not good if you profess to be fiscally conservative.”Ashley Murray contributed to this story.",,,,2025-07-02 16:09:16.025004

Ron DeSantis delivers remarks during a press conference in Jacksonville on Jan. 10, 2025. (Screenshot from Florida Channel)Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that was intended to limit state and local officials from using their official authority or influence to solicit campaign contributions.
The legislation (HB 1445) sponsored by Melbourne Republican Debbie Mayfield also would have prohibited reimbursement for transportation expenses of agency heads who live outside of Tallahassee.
The legislative proposal was introduced after NBC News reported that two top staffers in the governor’s office were calling state lobbyists to raise money for a political committee aligned with the governor at the same time that news surfaced that First Lady Casey DeSantis was considering a run for governor. State officials denied the report.
The bill was passed unanimously in the Senate and 97-1 in the House. Palm Beach Republican Mike Caruso, an ally of the governor, was the only dissenter.
Veto override?
Speaking on Matt Gaetz’s program on the One America News Network on Tuesday night, Miami-Dade House Republican Juan Porras called the veto “irresponsible” and said the Legislature could attempt to override it.
“If there were any bill that the Legislature would override the governor’s veto, it probably would be this one,” he said.
“I think in my opinion [it’s] irresponsible that the governor decided to veto this,” Porras added. “I think it looks bad on his part. But I do think this is something that all of the Legislature could probably get behind and override if the Senate probably were to agree.”
“I might know someone over there,” Gaetz quipped, referring to his father — Don Gaetz — who won re-election to the Senate last year after serving as Senate president in 2012-14 and now chairs the Ethics and Elections Committee.
The veto was no surprise, since the governor blasted the proposal earlier in the session. That’s when the legislation called for all executive branch appointees who live outside the state capital to have to move to Tallahassee.
“They’re saying all the agency heads must live in the swamp,” DeSantis said during a press conference in Pensacola in April. “I want to drain the swamp; I don’t want to refill the swamp. Where are they getting this? It’s an asinine proposal.”
Lawmakers later removed that provision, but kept the language that would prohibit executive directors of executive branch departments, secretaries of executive branch departments, and chief administrative officers of government entities housed under the executive branch from being reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred between their residences and department headquarters. It would also have prohibited per diem and subsistence allowance when remaining overnight in their county of residence.
The bill also required members of the state’s Board of Governors to be U.S. citizens and either a Florida resident or a graduate of a state university. It also required members of a state university board of trustees to be U.S. citizens and either a Florida resident or a graduate of the university overseen by such a board.
In his letter explaining his veto of the legislation on Tuesday, DeSantis focused only on that provision only of the proposal.
“CS/HB 1445 attempts to impose additional eligibility criteria by requiring members of the BOG [Board of Governors] and BOT [Board of Trustees} to be ‘either a resident of this state or a graduate of [a/the] state university.’ However, the Florida Supreme Court has ‘consistently held that statutes imposing additional qualifications for office are unconstitutional where the basic document of the constitution itself has already undertaken to set forth those requirements.’”
Bad blood
The governor’s veto of Mayfield’s bill comes with some history.
She had originally supported DeSantis run for president in 2023 but, along with a handful of GOP state lawmakers, publicly flipped their support to Donald Trump during a Republican presidential summit in Orlando that fall.
Mayfield served the past eight years in the Senate before being term-limited in 2024. She won a House seat last fall but decided to run again for her old seat earlier this year once it became vacant following Randy Fine’s decision to run for Congress.
The Florida Department of State attempted to deny her the ability to run for that seat, saying it would violate the state term limit law. She challenged that decision and won in state court a week later, and ultimately won that Senate seat last month.

Lawmakers of both political parties made their top job in the 2025 session addressing stiff increases in residential property taxes, and after negotiations that took nearly the entire session, they agreed to legislation that aims to help.
Margie MacDonald, who looks out for senior citizens as a lobbyist for Big Sky 55+, said the group she represents came out with “a big win.”
“We felt it was a major substantial cut for the vast majority of older Montanans who were hit the hardest by the 2023 property tax shift,” MacDonald said.
The most recent reappraisal cycle pushed up the median tax bill for residential payers 21%, and the increase was expected to continue. In 2023, reappraisals went up a record 46% on average.
Now, the work done at the Capitol is starting to shape up in the real world, and local and state legislators and lobbyists are counting wins — such a change in the conversation about who’s to blame — and already pointing to losses — such as hefty increases for Montanans who own second homes.
This week, the Department of Revenue announced it is sending out reappraisal notices to property taxpayers and asked them to review them as soon as possible. The DOR said the information will reflect the recent changes signed into law.
“It’s important that Montana property owners review this information,” said Brendan Beatty, director of the Montana Department of Revenue, in a statement. “If property owners wait until property tax bills are sent in November, it will be too late for the department to correct property characteristics and make adjustments that may impact the value of the property for Tax Year 2025.”
House Appropriations Chairman Llew Jones, largely seen as the architect of the property tax redesign in the 2025 session, said he believes the new system evens out a spike that had put a significant burden on residential payers at the expense of other classes.
Jones said the business lobby paid lower taxes, but this session, they weren’t quite as happy.
“They all walked the halls and yelled at me,” said Jones, R-Conrad.
An analysis Jones shared from the Department of Revenue shows the before-and-after estimates of payments based on changes from House Bill 231 and Senate Bill 542 — the two main bills that together addressed property taxes.
The analysis assumes other factors remain the same, such as local levies.
In Cascade County, for example, a home valued at $400,000 would have been billed $3,225 without any change from the legislature.
With the pair of bills that passed, the owner will be billed an estimated $2,217 instead in 2025 and $2,238 in 2026, according to the analysis, again, with other factors being equal. That’s a difference of $987.
“For many Montana homeowners — with homes around $400,000 — the estimated savings top $1,000 or more per year,” Jones said in a statement. “But remember: these are projections. Actual savings will depend on local mill levies set by your county, city and schools.”
County Commissioner Josh Slotnick of Missoula said increases in value coming soon from the Department of Revenue might “usurp the gains” people may have experienced in property tax relief, if not completely, at least partially.
But Slotnick said one important thing that happened in the most recent session goes beyond the work to reduce the hit to residential payers. He said Gov. Greg Gianforte “is forever saying your local officials have a spending problem.”
But Slotnick said legislators, including Jones and Missoula Democratic Reps. Mark Thane and Jonathan Karlen, were able to respond to data instead — which showed the burden had shifted onto residential taxpayers.
“A huge victory is that to a large degree, the discussion stopped being about, ‘How do we stop county commissioners and mayors from spending like drunken sailors?’ To, ‘How do we deal with the burden shift?’” said Slotnick, a Democrat.
He said the outcome is a nod to fairness.
“This solution isn’t a Democratic solution. It isn’t a Republican solution. It’s a solution based in reality,” Slotnick said.

Gianforte, a Republican, signed the pair of bills that account for the property tax redesign.
Together, HB 231 and SB 542 provide for a graduated tax rate with three tiers for homes, support a rebate, and offer relief for homes that are primary residences, including long-term rentals, among other provisions.
The governor vetoed a bill that would have expanded a property tax credit for elderly people.
In his veto letter, Gianforte said the program in House Bill 831 would have cost $7 million, the program already works well in its current form, and seniors benefit from the other property tax relief bills he signed.
Meanwhile, residential property taxpayers also recently received postcards about a smaller short-term patch — a reminder from the Department of Revenue that property tax rebates of up to $400 will be available starting August 15, 2025.
Although some politicians praise the outcome from Helena, Commissioner Mike McGinley, from Beaverhead County, remains skeptical that residents in his district will benefit.
McGinley is a Republican who has been one of the most outspoken local politicians when it comes to recent property tax increases and challenges for local governments.
He has pointed out that local governments have been living under a constraint in state law that allowed them to increase property taxes in general just half the rate of inflation — putting them more behind year after year.
McGinley said he isn’t convinced the new system will work well in Beaverhead County.
For the county itself, he said, an estimated 27% drop for residential payers will probably hit agriculture and commercial classes and “cause a little controversy.”
Also, he said Dillon, the county seat, doesn’t have a diverse tax base, so the only way to make up the difference is by levying more mills — on the same residential payers.
McGinley said maybe on the whole, the legislation will help residential payers in the state, especially by shifting some of the responsibility to people with second homes. But he said he doesn’t believe some taxpayers in his district will see relief.
“People who are expecting these big tax decreases better buckle down. It can’t happen,” McGinley said.
Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, who spoke throughout the legislative session about hardships on seniors, said tens of thousands of people who qualified for the property tax rebate issued after the last 2023 session still missed out.
Dunwell said she worries that the same people who either didn’t hear about the rebate or had trouble with the application will be in the same boat this time.
This year, the state is paying rebates, and rebate applications automatically enroll a property taxpayer in the homestead rate reduction starting in 2026, according to a recent guest piece in the Missoulian from Thane, Karlen, and other Democratic members of the House Tax Committee.
“The poorest people, the most vulnerable, the most disenfranchised, the ones who generally fall through the cracks, are again going to fall through the cracks,” Dunwell said.
The Department of Revenue did not answer questions sent Friday about the outreach it is doing, in addition to the postcard, to ensure eligible people receive the breaks the legislature intended. In fall 2023, the DOR estimated 43,000 people who were eligible for rebates had not received them.
Although Dunwell raised concerns, she also said the property tax relief package that passed is an improvement, and if something isn’t working — “we’ll come back next session and fix it.”
The redesign aimed to support Montana residents with one home, a “homestead,” including by dropping the rate for the first $400,000 in value from 1.35% to 0.76% — while the rate for second homes goes from 1.35% to 1.9%.
Some Montana residents who aren’t rich but have family cabins have said the outcome means they get a break on their main residence but “crushing increases” on their second home.
“For many families, that may mean being forced to sell long-held properties and likely losing them to out-of-state buyers,” said Vicki Turner of Helena in a letter Dunwell shared. “That’s not only unfair, but it is also unjust and heartbreaking.”
Jones, though, said the goal was to support the majority of Montana residents — “the vast majority of folks are just trying to pay for their one house.” He said Montanans with vacation homes aren’t treated differently than others with vacation homes.
“Most folks don’t have two homes,” Jones said.
Slotnick, with Missoula County, said the difficulty in a place where values keep increasing is that even if commissioners increase taxes 4%, that bump could translate into a 20% increase in someone’s property tax bill.
“How it’s not fair is the increase in your home’s value is not an accurate value of your ability to pay,” Slotnick said.”
The pair of property tax relief bills reduce the tax rate on a graduated scale for residential property, which lowers the taxable value of the property, he said. In doing so, he said, it shifts the tax burden back to other classes of payers.
“The reason this is so difficult is some of those others (taxpayer groups) have really intense lobbyists and attorneys who typically win their arguments,” Slotnick said.
Slotnick said he appreciates the legislation because people with homes that have a lower value will get a larger reduction, and that result pleases him as a progressive Democrat.
But he also said people in Missoula, for example, won’t see as much relief as residents of some other counties because Missoula has a lot more houses in the $750,000 to $800,000 range.
“We have a whole bunch of middle income people who really need help who, through no fault of their own, own a $850,000 home,” he said. “I am one of them.”
(Slotnick, a farmer, said he bought a $250,000 property in 2000, and it’s now worth $850,000.)
But Slotnick also said legislators applied a scale they thought would work for the most people, and the bills are fair.
“They did a great job of trying to Goldilocks this thing,” he said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1154736495-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 16:09:16.025004

Glenn Youngkin, flanked by Petersburg Police Chief Travis Christian, speaks to reporters at the Virginia State Police headquarters in Richmond on July 2, 2025. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday doubled down on the controversial use of courthouse arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, brushing off criticism that some of the individuals detained were simply in court to pay fines for traffic infractions and had no criminal record.
“Let’s just be clear, the vast majority of the people that have been arrested at courthouses around the country are committing violent crimes,” Youngkin said at a press conference at the Virginia State Police headquarters in Richmond. “If someone breaks the law and is here illegally, they should be arrested.”
Although not involved in the recent courthouse raids, Youngkin hailed efforts by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a state-federal partnership he launched in February to target gang members, narcotics traffickers and undocumented immigrants with criminal records. 
“This work is critical, and it’s happening all over the commonwealth of Virginia,” he said. “We just passed over 2,500 arrests through our Virginia Homeland Security Task Force. Two-thousand five-hundred violent criminals who are here illegally — MS-13 members, Tren de Aragua, others, international violent gang members.”
Describing the task force as a “national model of success,” Youngkin credited the rapid rollout of Virginia’s 287(g) agreement with ICE — approved just 20 hours after his Executive Order 47 in February — for much of the operation’s momentum. The program allows state and local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.
“It started with a plan, and then stepped to a 287(g) memorandum with the federal government and our State Police and our Department of Corrections, and yes, some of our local law enforcement partners,” Youngkin said Wednesday. “This is a concerted effort to collaborate with the federal government to make sure that violent criminals that are here illegally are arrested.”
When asked by The Mercury about recent arrests in Chesterfield County, where ICE agents detained at least 14 people over several days last week — including a man who had come to court to pay traffic fines — Youngkin didn’t waver.
“First of all, if you break the law in America and you’re here illegally, then you should be detained and deported,” he said. “That’s common sense.”
Youngkin emphasized that ICE is not targeting houses of worship or schools and accused the media of distorting the intent of enforcement efforts.
“They’re not going to schools and they’re not going to churches … the media really wants to try to sow deceit,” he said.
Several news reports, however, confirm ICE has conducted arrests on church grounds and near schools since sensitive-location protections were rolled back. 
In California, migrants were detained outside churches and in parking lots, sparking backlash from local faith leaders. Meanwhile, school districts across the U.S. are preparing for ICE presence amid concerns over student safety and civil rights. 
And in Washington, D.C., immigration officers attempted to detain a school healthcare worker at a local elementary school parking lot — prompting school officials to demand ID and warrants before letting them on campus.
The arrests in Chesterfield drew immediate backlash from community leaders and local officials, who say the enforcement actions are sweeping up residents with no history of violent crime and undermining public trust in the legal system.
One of those detained was Salvador Calderon-Cuellar, whose immigration status remains unclear. 
According to court records, Calderon-Cuellar pleaded guilty in April to two traffic violations — driving without a license and failure to yield — and appeared at the Chesterfield courthouse on June 25 to pay a $130 fine when ICE officers took him into custody through the back entrance.
Jessica Schneider, a member of the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors, was addressing a protest outside the courthouse when she learned of his arrest.
“He had no prior arrests,” she said. “Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained? This is a person that is here, working in our communities, and why are we punishing him?”
Protesters condemned the arrests as politically motivated and harmful to due process. Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, called the courthouse a “sacred place in a democracy,” warning that ICE raids would dissuade victims and witnesses from engaging with the legal system.
The courthouse operation is part of a larger statewide trend. 
In addition to Chesterfield, ICE has carried out arrests in Sterling, Albemarle County, and Richmond in recent months. In a joint ICE-FBI operation in Northern Virginia  seven undocumented individuals were detained in what the agency described as a targeted enforcement effort.
Youngkin’s task force is comprised of more than 200 officers from the FBI, ICE, Virginia State Police, and the Department of Corrections. 
ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said in April the expanded use of 287(g) agreements has been a key driver of arrests in Virginia. FBI Director Kash Patel called the effort “a tremendous success,” while U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the governor’s alignment with the Trump administration’s “Make America Safe Again” agenda.
But research complicates the narrative that undocumented immigrants pose an outsized threat. A 2024 report funded by the National Institute of Justice found that undocumented immigrants in Texas were arrested at significantly lower rates than U.S.-born citizens — including for violent, property, and drug crimes.
Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond, said in a statement last week that the Chesterfield arrests “desecrate the very temple of justice their oath of office obligates them to uphold.” He has proposed reforms to restrict ICE access to courthouses, labeling the raids a violation of constitutional dignity.
And Amanda Pohl, clerk of the Chesterfield Circuit Court, said she only became aware of the ICE operation after it was already underway. 
“They’ve been in plain clothes, and so I don’t actually have an accounting of how long they were here,” she told The Mercury. While her office doesn’t coordinate with ICE, she said she was reviewing internal policy to ensure “this is a courthouse where people feel safe.”
But for Youngkin, the political calculus is clear. “This is about safety,” he said Wednesday. “And today, Virginia is safer.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a proclamation for a special session on Wednesday, calling Legislators back to Juneau in August to pass legislation on education reform and his executive order creating a new Department of Agriculture.
The special session also means that lawmakers cannot wait until January to vote on overrides to the governor’s budget vetoes and his vetoes on several policy bills. They must vote in the first five days of the special session.
That’s significant, because 45 votes are needed to override a budget veto, and while there were 46 votes in favor of a prior veto override this spring, at least one legislator who voted in favor of that override will be unavailable in August.
The 30-day special session is scheduled to begin 10 a.m. August 2 in Juneau.
Agriculture is currently overseen by a division within the Department of Natural Resources. 
​​“Enacting a few necessary reforms to our public education system can elevate those children struggling in Alaska’s school system,” said Dunleavy in an email statement with the announcement. “As elected officials we must do all we can to put the next generation on the path to a successful and prosperous future, and that starts with a solid public education. Splitting the Division of Agriculture away from DNR into a department will elevate food security and support our hard-working farmers while growing the agricultural sector.”
The announcement comes in the wake of a historic veto override vote, 46-14, by the Legislature rejecting Dunleavy’s veto of an education funding bill, House Bill 57, raising the core of the state’s education formula by  $700 per student. Dunleavy then made a budget veto of part of the funding for schools, pushing it down to $500 per student, and House and Senate leadership have promised to override that veto in the next session. 
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said he was surprised by the announcement and learned about it from reporters calling him for comment.
The special session will force lawmakers to vote early on veto overrides for education funding and a variety of other bills, he said. Legislative attorneys have told lawmakers that with the governor’s proclamation, they cannot defer those votes until the regular session begins in January.
That’s a problem for supporters of an education veto override, because 45 of 60 legislators are needed for that vote to succeed. This spring, a policy veto override garnered 46 votes, but Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is in Poland on a National Guard deployment and is expected to be unavailable in August.
Other legislators may also be unavailable, Stevens said.
And supporters of an override have questioned whether all of the votes from the previous override vote will hold for a budget override.
In May, lawmakers voted 32-28 to deny an executive order by Dunleavy to create a new Department of Agriculture, citing the proposal’s costs as well as creation through an executive order rather than as legislation, with public input.

That’s less than 1% of the total forestland surveyed.","A foggy morning at Calispell Meadows on the Colville National Forest in northeast Washington. (Photo courtesy of U.S. Forest Service)More than half a million acres of trees spread across Washington were sick, struggling, or dead last year, according to the results of an aerial survey of forests by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.
Surveyors identified about 545,000 acres with some level of tree mortality, defoliation, or disease, the department said this week. That’s less than 1% of the total forestland surveyed.
The amount of forest with problems is up nearly 30,000 acres from 2023 and more than the 10-year average of 519,000 acres, but well below the acres mapped with diseased or dead trees in 2022, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Forest Service partnered to conduct an aerial survey of 22 million forested acres in Washington state to observe recently killed and damaged trees. They carried out the survey between June and September last year.
The agencies, as well as the Oregon State Department of Forestry, have been partnering on aerial detection surveys since 1947, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
Washington experienced above average temperatures for the majority of 2024, with some level of drought observed on most lands by fall.
“The main climate takeaway for Washington in 2024 was the continuation of long-term warming trends,” the Department of Natural Resources stated in the report. “For the third time in four years, the annual average temperature in Washington was among the 10 warmest on record.”
The “unusually dry and warm weather” likely contributed to tree stress and insect success, the Department of Natural Resources reported.
Insects were the primary cause of the tree damage mapped last year.
Bark beetles, in particular, were responsible for about 270,000 acres of damage. Notable bark beetles with high activity are the fir engraver, the mountain pine beetle, the western pine beetle and the silver fir beetle.
While the silver fir beetle only damaged 2,900 acres of Washington forests last year, up from just 500 acres in 2023, Department of Natural Resources entomologist Glenn Kohler said that beetle’s damage is among the most visible, given its presence in the North Cascades National Park, Snoqualmie Pass and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.
“We will certainly be interested to see if the current peak is sustained for a second year,” Kohler said.
Another outbreak noted in the 2024 report is the continued presence of the California fivespined ips beetle, which has been the cause of increasing pine tree deaths since 2022 in urban forest settings around the Puget Sound region. The beetle was first detected in Washington in 2010.
Also of concern is the western spruce budworm, which caused defoliation damage to more than 63,500 acres of forest in 2024 after three years of no recorded activity.
Western spruce budworm outbreaks are uncommon in Washington state, according to the Department of Natural Resources, with the last outbreaks occurring in 2011 and 2012.
The current outbreak is most visible east of Ross Lake in Whatcom, Skagit and Okanogan counties, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The 10-year average of forest damage in Washington is skewed by a two-year gap during the COVID pandemic, when the full 22 million acres of Washington state’s forest were not surveyed.
A total of 550,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2021, but only 19 million acres were surveyed that year. Similarly, only 10.5 million acres were surveyed in 2020, with 322,000 acres of damage mapped.
Data used for those two surveys was acquired through a combination of ground sampling and remote sensing in place of survey flights.
The standard 22 million acres of Washington’s forests were mapped in 2019, 2022 and 2023. A total of 658,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2019, 672,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2022, and 517,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2023.
“Similar to wildfire season data, it’s better to make observations over a longer period, like a 10 year stretch, to gauge trendlines,” said Will Rubin, a spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources.
The data is included in an annual Department of Natural Resources report that summarizes insects, diseases, and other disturbances affecting Washington’s forests.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/colville-national-forest.jpg,,,2025-07-02 16:09:16.025004

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Tuesday marked the first day that Montanans can say that abortion — up to the point of viability — is protected specifically through an amendment in the state’s Constitution.
Voters in November overwhelmingly supported the constitutional right, even though the procedure has long been legal, and Constitutional Initiative 128 became the law of the state, despite a last-minute legal challenge.
That challenge was rebuffed on Tuesday by a unanimous decision of the Montana Supreme Court not to hear the case brought by several individuals and the Montana Life Defense Fund, a committee association with the Montana Family Foundation. The lawsuit asked the high court to intervene, halt the amendment from going into effect, and declare it void, due to concerns that voters on Election Day did not have enough information to properly decide the issue.
The Supreme Court dismissed the late challenge, and said that the suit was poorly timed and didn’t even develop a set of facts adequately. Meanwhile, the Montana Family Foundation said while it was disappointed in the decision, it would continue the fight at the district court level.
“We remain confident in the strength of our arguments and will now proceed at the district court level. While today’s decision is a setback in timing, it is not the end of the road. This is justice delayed — not justice denied,” said Derek Oestreicher, chief legal counsel for the Montana Family Foundation.
Two plaintiffs, Joe Addy and Hannah Rhodes, had asked the high court to intervene and invalidate CI-128, which makes abortion legal up to the point of fetal viability. They argued that because the text of the entire amendment was not printed fully on the ballot, and because voters who registered to vote on Election Day did not have the full text or the voter information booklet issued by the state, they were not adequately informed.
However, the Montana Supreme Court rejected all of those arguments and criticized the plaintiffs for bringing the challenge just a few weeks before the abortion amendment was to be enacted.
Moreover, the court said that CI-128 was handled the same way as every other ballot measure since 1978, so that if the court would have accepted the argument, it opened up the possibility that all amendments since were also constitutionally deficient.
“Any urgency of emergency that exists is entirely of the Defense Fund’s own making, because it waited seven months to file this petition,” the court said in the seven-page order, which outlined why it turned down the request. “We have repeatedly warned parties they cannot manufacture an emergency due to lack of diligence.”
While the plaintiffs said they did not know what they were voting for or against by registering to vote on Election Day with the full text of the amendment not printed on the ballot, the court criticized them because copies of the full voters’ guide and the full text are required to be available at every voting precinct.
“The Defense Fund does not tell us how many election-day registrants exist for the 2024 General Election, nor does it assert that the number of election-day registrants was sufficient to change the outcome of this vote,” the court noted.
The Supreme Court also pointed out that state law requires the Montana Secretary of State to print a voter information guide, as well as preparing the ballot information for publication in newspapers or other platforms at the county and state level.
In addition to publishing the text in newspapers around the state and having voting guides sent to all registered voters and available at the polling locations, the Supreme Court said that “the Secretary of State maintains a website, accessible to the public, that includes the (Voter Information Pamphlet) along with other information about Montana’s elections.”
“The Defense Fund has not demonstrated that the electorate was not provided with the full text of CI-128,” the order said. “…And it has not developed the facts necessary to support its legal arguments.”

Tony Evers signed bills into law launching efforts to bring nuclear power to Wisconsin and creating and expanding programs to help children in crisis. Evers talks to reporters in March. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Ahead of floor sessions for the Senate and Assembly to vote on the budget, Gov. Tony Evers signed bills into law launching efforts to bring nuclear power to Wisconsin and creating and expanding programs to help children in crisis.
The bills passed the Senate and Assembly in floor sessions in June where debate centered heavily on the lack of funding attached to them. Evers had earlier told lawmakers to include the funding or he would veto the legislation, Democrats agreed the funding should be included, while Republicans said the funding would come in the budget if Evers signed the bills without any changes. State funding for the bills was included in the budget plan approved by the budget committee Tuesday.
One law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 11, will create a Nuclear Power Summit Board in Wisconsin responsible for putting on a summit in Madison to advance nuclear power and fusion energy technology.
The summit must be held within one month after instruction starts at the new engineering building at UW-Madison. Construction on the building, which is estimated to cost $419 million, started in April and is supposed to be finished in 2028. The funding for the building was approved by the Legislature and Evers in 2024.
Evers also signed 2025 Wisconsin Act 12, which requires the Public Service Commission to conduct a study to determine potential sites for a nuclear power plant. The state budget bill includes $2 million to fund the study.
Evers said the bills would help the state pursue an “innovative, clean energy future and bring more clean jobs to our state.”
Wisconsin currently has one active nuclear power plant. The Point Beach Nuclear Plant located in Two Rivers, which first came online in the 1970s, has two tractors and provides about 16% of the state’s energy, according to the conservative think tank the Badger Institute. A Kewaunee nuclear power plant shut down in 2013. 
“We can’t afford to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment or creating good-paying jobs and building a strong economy, and by working toward clean energy options Wisconsinites can depend on in the future, we’re doing both,” Evers said. “We must continue our efforts to help lower energy costs and improve energy independence by reducing our reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and these bills are an important step in the right direction.”
Evers also signed Senate Bill 106, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 9, that will create psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) in the state. The law is the result of a study committee on the emergency detention and civil commitment of minors and aims to reduce the number of  youth in crisis who are sent out of state for care by offering long-term mental health treatment closer to home.
The budget will include $1.79 million for grants to psychiatric residential treatment facilities.
Another law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 10, which is also a result of the study committee, instructs the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to create a statewide portal to facilitate the sharing of safety plans for minors with designated safety plan partners. The budget includes about $819,000 in state funding for the program and the agency will get one staff position to run the portal. 
Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), who served as chair of the study committee, has championed the legislation this session.
At a press conference ahead of the Senate floor session, James said his focus has been on supporting Wisconsin’s children and that the issues are personal for him as a father and a law enforcement officer.
“I believe there are real positive changes within our reach. It’s about recognizing the opportunities in front of us and taking decisive action when that moment comes,” James said. “This budget is packed with great projects. We increase funding for our child advocacy centers. We take care of our child victims in a safe environment. We establish funding for psychiatric residential treatment facilities to keep children with intense mental health treatment needs closer to home.” 
Another law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 13, officially recognizes new child advocacy centers in state statute and expands the number of them that are eligible for the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s child advocacy grant program. The centers work with law enforcement to investigate child abuse and neglect and provide children with resources and support. The budget will include $2 million to support the grants. 
The final piece of legislation is 2025 Wisconsin Act 14, to distribute hearing protection devices to state and local law enforcement and firefighters. The budget will include $2.6 million to fund the program.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The same year Nebraskans voted to cement an abortion ban beyond the first trimester into the state constitution, the number of abortions performed in Nebraska rose about 7.6%. 
According to data from the state Department of Health and Human Services, at least 2,501 abortions were performed in Nebraska in 2024. That’s 176 higher than 2023’s total of 2,325 abortions in one year. 
Since 2020, Nebraska’s abortion rate has remained relatively level between about 2,300 to 2,500 procedures per year. All the while, the state’s abortion policy has fluctuated more wildly. 
In 2022, when Nebraska banned abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy, state lawmakers were considering a full abortion ban that would be triggered when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
The trigger bill did not pass, and the next year lawmakers returned with a proposal to ban most abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. That proposal did not pass either, but in the same session lawmakers approved an amended bill to ban most abortions at 12 weeks post-gestation. 
For the 2024 election, abortion-rights advocates launched an initiative to expand abortion access within the Nebraska Constitution, which was swiftly met with an opposing initiative aimed at enshrining the current ban in the constitution. The more restrictive measure passed by roughly 55% of voters.
Breaking down the data
Nebraska’s monthly abortion rate in 2024 fluctuated between a low of 174 recorded in February, up to 250 recorded in October, just before the election. 
By far, the most popular method for undergoing an abortion was via medication, which accounted for 2,024 of the 2,501 abortions recorded in 2024 — just under 81% overall. The second most common method was curettage with suction, which made up 475 abortions that year.

Compared to 2023, Nebraska saw fewer clients traveling from other states for abortions in 2024. In 2023, Nebraska logged clients from 19 outside states, while 2024 logged 14 other states. 
The number of clients traveling from each of those states also dropped in all but one state. For example, neighbor Kansas had 51 patients in 2023 compared to just two in 2024, and Texas had 46 patients in 2023 and 10 in 2024. 
The outlier is Iowa, which already made up the largest amount of out-of-state clients in 2023, with 222 that year. In 2024, that number rose to 358 clients. 
This comes as no surprise to Ruth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States (PPNCS). Iowa bans most abortions after cardiac activity is detected, which typically happens around six weeks of pregnancy. Advocates have said this essentially amounts to a total ban, as most women don’t realize they’re pregnant at that point. 
In a PPNCS press release, the organization reported that abortions performed in Iowa dropped sharply after its ban took effect in the summer of 2024. In comparison, abortions provided in Nebraska have risen about 68% since Roe was overturned in 2022, Richardson said. 
“More people must travel to get essential health care, when they deserve to be able to get it in their own communities,” Richardson said in the press release. “And yet amidst all this chaos and manufactured confusion, we have innovated and implemented solutions that have increased the number of abortion patients we have served.”    
Sandy Danek, executive director of Nebraska Right to Life, agreed that Iowa’s new abortion ban likely contributed to the rise in Iowan clients traveling to Nebraska for abortions in 2024. She said women who feel like they need an abortion often seek out states with more “liberal” abortion laws when their state is more restrictive. 
DHHS’ data reported that more than half of Nebraska’s abortions performed in 2024 happened between six to eight weeks gestation. Considering that, Danek said she feels the state’s current abortion ban past the first trimester is still too lax. She also acknowledged that further restrictions may risk encouraging Nebraskans to travel to states where abortions are more accessible. 
Danek said there are plenty of alternatives to abortions available to women who may feel they have no other option, but the challenge lies in getting the word out to those women. 
“You want to balance your dollar to both provide those services to women, but then also reach out to make the community know that they exist,” Danek said. “And that’s a juggling act.”
Implications for Nebraska’s future 
Following voters’ approval of the first-trimester abortion ban in November, abortion-rights advocates speculated that officials in the anti-abortion camp would use the victory to push for further restrictions. Officials in that camp, including Gov. Jim Pillen, told a different story, saying that it wasn’t the right time to try for more. 
While there were no bills introduced in Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session that would have directly increased the state’s abortion ban, several bills were introduced that advocates claim were intended to narrow abortion access. Those included a bill to increase requirements for medication abortions from State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue (LB 512), and a bill to require the burial or cremation of abortion remains from Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair (LB 632).

Neither of those bills passed this session, but both will remain on the books when lawmakers reconvene in 2026. 
Though it’s too early for Nebraska Right to Life to identify priorities for the 2026 session, Danek said she supports Holdcroft’s bill. Given that the vast majority of recent Nebraska abortions are performed through medication, and she claims abortion pills are linked to a range of negative side effects, Danek said LB 512 is “a good starting place.” 
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood officials are grappling with potential new obstacles at the federal level. Congress is considering a version of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood for one year for any health care service provided by the organization. 
The bill passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, and is up for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives as early as this week. 
Through this uncertainty, Richardson said PPNCS is looking for ways to expand their services, particularly for clients in health care deserts who have to travel longer distances for in-person care. She said they are increasing their investments in telehealth and service lines for primary care, for example.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)Not all farmers and ranchers will agree in a discussion about climate change, but it would be difficult to find a Midwest producer who did not value climate-related data addressing drought, precipitation, temperature and frost outlooks. 
These are all pieces of data gathered and distributed by the Ames-based Midwest Climate Hub, which along with the other 10 regional climate hubs under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is slated to be cut from the federal agriculture budget. 
The U.S. House appropriations bill that sets the 2026 fiscal year budgets for agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration and related agencies includes “no funds for climate hubs or climate corps.” 
The summary of the bill, which closely follows budget requests from President Donald Trump, says it “safeguards American taxpayer dollars and preserves core functions” by eliminating funding for climate hubs, among other changes. 
Eleven regional Climate Hubs were established as interagency departments by USDA in 2014 with the goal of coordinating across USDA agencies, and with U.S. producers, on climate resiliency strategies.

Lowering the information barrier
Laurie Nowatzke was formerly the associate director of the Midwest Climate Hub, before she was terminated in February and then brought back in March briefly before she took the second deferred resignation program offered to federal employees.
Nowatzke said part of her role at the hub was to “bridge” on-the-ground responses and needs of producers to USDA research, and vice versa.
Each climate hub is a little different, depending on the needs of their region, but Nowatzke said climate, in its most basic form relating to weather patterns, was a big focus for the Midwest.
“A huge focus of ours was taking that sort of experienced climate and weather conditions and how that applies or affects agriculture,” Nowatzke said.
This is most seen through the ag-focus climate outlooks the hub put out monthly, and weekly during crop season.
Nowatzke said as of the end of April when she left the office, staff were not allowed to update content on the website and have instead continued to send the outlooks via email to subscribers.
She said the climate outlooks were a “key product” the hub put out that producers and stakeholders said was especially helpful to contextualize the “vast array of climate and weather data” available from outlets like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Rod Pierce, a long-time corn and soybean farmer in central Iowa, said the outlooks help him with both long- and short-term planning in his operation. They help him answer questions such as when is the last frost so he can plant, is it going to be dry, and importantly, what conditions are other Midwestern states facing that he should take into account when marketing his commodities.
“Weather is so important in us making decisions, trying to look at the trend for the year…do I want to grow corn or beans…it just helps put some of that stuff in line,” Pierce said.
He said the hub reports give him a “big picture” of trends in the region, and he feels the information is trustworthy.
“We know the people that are doing it are not just blowing smoke,” Pierce said. “It’s good data, it’s researched data.”
Alli Wenman, the regional climate outreach project manager for the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s  extension, said in interviews with extension office managers and educators throughout the Midwest, she learned access to training and applicable information were the top tools these professionals said they needed to discuss the impacts of climate change with producers in their regions. 
“They need to know the climate science … but they also need to know the social science, like, how do I facilitate that conversation around climate,” Wenman said. “The hub has that information and has the capacity to build those tools, the capacity to build those trainings.” 
Wenman spoke with these professionals as part of a project, funded by USDA, to forge connections between university extension programs and the climate hubs and work toward greater agricultural resilience in the face of climate change. 
She said the partnership with the Midwest Climate Hub was “key” to cut through the “noise” at the research level and give producers the tools and data that matter most to their operations. 
Wenman said the ag-focused climate outlooks have become a trustworthy source of information for a lot of producers. 
“The information is out there, but it’s maybe not framed for ag,” Wenman said. “There’s too much information, so they help us sort through what information is relevant for ag and put it into ag terms.”
The reports pull information from nearly a dozen agencies and compile it into a four-page report full of climate, crop and soil moisture information and graphics. 
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, who served on the subcommittee that passed the bill, said the hubs are a “duplicative” program and the same research can be conducted through competitive agriculture research programs that are already funded by the federal government and supported by the House’s newest bill. 
The bill’s report shows it would terminate the funding for climate hubs and climate corps, which were initiated under former President Joe Biden to train young people for high-demand clean energy jobs. 
“The bill maintains critical funding to ensure we have the safest food, drugs, and devices in the world and puts America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities first,” the bill report reads. 
Hinson, in a statement, said “farmers felt like they were screaming into a void” as the the Biden administration “focused on DEI and radical climate policies” while farmers’ “real needs were ignored.” 
“This bill cuts wasteful spending – including for so-called “Climate Hubs” – and champions President Trump’s farmer-first agenda to strengthen longstanding research programs, support rural businesses and infrastructure, and safeguard our food supply,” Hinson said. “I will continue to support farmer-led conservation initiatives to ensure Iowa producers are empowered with conservation tools and have all the resources they need to feed and fuel the world.”
The House appropriations committee also tried to reject funding for the hubs in its FY25 budget bill, though the Senate’s version expanded funding for the program. Because Congress has failed to pass appropriations bills, the government has been operating on continuing spending resolutions based on the fiscal year 2024 budget.
The Senate passed the massive, budget reconciliation package, known as the “one big beautiful bill” Tuesday which sets mandatory spending over a 10-year span. The appropriations bills, like the House-proposed ag bill, are separate budgets that deal with discretionary spending in the agencies. 
Reports form the Hub
While the climate outlook reports are what many Midwest producers might know the hub for, the regional hubs also produced reports on the impacts of climate change, and mitigation strategies, on agriculture, forestry, tribal lands, wetlands and other region-specific areas.
Nowatzke said funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration helped the hub to “really chip away” at climate mitigation concerns and greenhouse gas emissions.
“So (the hub was) starting to move beyond just dealing with climate change or near-term weather events, but also addressing agriculture’s impact on climate change as well,” Nowatzke said. 
The Midwest Climate Hub produced reports like “Climate Change Impacts on Iowa Agriculture” and similar reports for eight Midwestern states. The reports calculated long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, growing season length and the impacts these have had, and are projected to have, on agriculture. 
Nowatzke said these reports also employed feedback from on-the-ground folks at extension offices, crop physiologists and farmers to determine the strategies that would be helpful for a farm trying to deal with a changing climate.  
The hub also explored, and produced reports on topics like: the relationship between climate change and specialty crops in the Midwest and a guide on managing the risks of field and equipment fires which are exacerbated by drought conditions. 
The hub, in collaboration with on Midwest Regional Climate Center, also reported and developed interactive tools for farmers on soil temperature and frost dates. 
Nowatzke said while the Climate Hub sits on a congressional chopping block, and has already dealt with cuts to staff and programs, most of the hub’s collaborating agencies have also been hit by federal cuts. 
She said without the hubs, this climate research at other agencies could persist, but she expects USDA would struggle in “delivering the science that they do, to the people that they’re developing the science for.” 
“Researchers serve a really important role in developing that work and publishing it, but also we need professionals who are trained and capable and have capacity to actually disseminate that in ways that people can use it,” Nowatzke said. 
Wenman said this is what she hears from other extension officers and producers who, while they might not use the term climate change, are seeking tools to help adapt to more extreme weather, drought patterns and other associated effects of a changing climate. Wenman said the hub information is “actionable” and the “stuff that really matters to people.” 
“Extension is trying to prepare our staff to better help farmers deal with the effects of changing climate conditions,” Wenman said. “Losing the hub would seriously hinder our ability to continue to do our jobs well within that realm.”

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance, formerly known as Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition)A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
States, hospital systems try less punitive drug testing of pregnant women and newborns

While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing or uranium mining and milling — including in South Dakota — is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded.
On Tuesday, Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Utah will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with.
People exposed to radiation from uranium mining and milling in South Dakota — primarily decades ago in the Edgemont area at the southern end of the Black Hills — were previously eligible for compensation and would remain eligible under the reauthorization. Seventy-nine claims from people residing in South Dakota have been awarded by the program since its inception, totaling $6.76 million.
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028.
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases.
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended from 1971 to 1990.

“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”
RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985.
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.”
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.

Surtax spending gets ‘complicated’,Sam Drysdale // State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/supplementing-or-supplanting-surtax-spending-gets-complicated/,"
The Legislature this week agreed to use nearly $500 million in surtax revenue to deliver a major boost to K-12 school funding, a move that some see as fulfilling the voter-approved mission of the tax on high earners while others warn it strays from the original promise of funding new education and transportation initiatives.

The budget that lawmakers sent to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk Monday includes a $496 million expansion to the state’s Chapter 70 funding that provides education revenue for local school districts. The money is being drawn from revenue generated by the 4 percent surtax on annual income over $1 million, approved by voters in 2022 through a ballot question, also called the Fair Share Amendment.
That single line item (1596-2450) accounts for just more than 20 percent of the $2.4 billion in surtax spending lawmakers agreed to for the fiscal 2026 budget. It represents a shift in how that revenue is being used — and it has drawn mixed reactions even among the groups that campaigned for the surtax in the first place.
“This budget was crafted with concern over what is going on at the federal level,” Massachusetts Teachers Association President Max Page said, referring to anticipated cuts from Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration. Though the union previously warned against using surtax funds to replace routine and recurring education spending, Page said this year’s context made the decision more understandable.
“But, importantly, we certainly would hope that this much to fulfill the SOA wouldn’t be a part of next year’s budget,” he said, referring to the 2019 Student Opportunity Act, which is phasing in more than $1.5 billion in additional funding for districts over seven years. “The way it’s been working, which we really approve of, is the regular budget funds the SOA investments, and we can do new investments like higher minimum aid, universal school meals, capital fund investments, through Fair Share.”
The fiscal 2026 budget increases Chapter 70 funding by $460 million over the previous year, according to the Senate Ways and Means Committee — and funds that increase with surtax dollars. In addition to supporting the fifth year of SOA implementation, the $496 million line item for so-called SOA expansion also includes a sharp increase in minimum per-pupil aid, from $104 to $150.
In past budgets, similar increases to Chapter 70 were paid for through general state revenues. The shift this year raised red flags for those who view the surtax as a way to go above and beyond standard funding obligations.
“Voters overwhelmingly approved the Fair Share Amendment to enable new investments in public education and transportation — not to plug existing budget gaps,” said Bahar Akman Imboden, director of the Hildreth Institute, a research center focused on equity in higher education. She said she was “disappointed” to see nearly $500 million “being used to backfill” K-12 spending.
Imboden warned that reallocating surtax revenue to cover existing commitments could undermine recent progress in spending surtax dollars on higher education, which has included making community colleges free and financial aid expansions. 
Those initiatives are continued in this budget, but she warned, “without corresponding investments in campus capacity, student supports, and infrastructure, the gains we’ve made in encouraging more Massachusetts students to pursue higher education will falter.”
About 11 percent of the surtax revenue in the fiscal 2026 budget is allocated to higher education, according to the Hildreth Institute — a roughly $5 million decrease from the previous year. On average, higher education line items saw a 0.5 percent increase in the fiscal 2026 budget, the Institute noted.
In previous years, surtax funds have been used to launch major new programs like universal free school meals, fare-free Regional Transit Authorities and free community college for all Massachusetts residents. Those are continued in the fiscal 2026 budget. Groups who backed the surtax saw those programs as examples of using the money for “supplementing, not supplanting” existing spending on education and transportation through general revenue.
In the first budget cycle after the surtax passed, the MTA issued an analysis praising the Legislature’s approach.
“Importantly, Senate Ways and Means, the House and the governor use Fair Share Amendment revenue in the FY24 budget only for new programs and expenditures,” the union wrote. “Regular annual increases for state programs, including a $595 million increase for Chapter 70 and more than $62 million for Special Education Circuit Breaker, are funded out of general state revenue – not Fair Share revenue.”
This year’s decision breaks from that precedent. But a policy analyst from a think tank that backed the surtax campaign says the change was likely necessary in the face of economic uncertainty, tighter general revenues, and a difficult fiscal year for most school districts around the state.
“There are more new things you could do if you weren’t using so much of it for Chapter 70, so it’s hard to see in isolation. It’s complicated,” said Colin Jones, deputy policy director at the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center.
“But this year when we hear talk about things like the impact of the trade war, tariffs, the economy and the federal budget, they’re building flexibility with this maneuver to increase Fair Share to cover basically all of the Chapter 70 increase this year,” he said. “That frees up general funds to do other stuff. And flexibility in this environment is pretty good.”
The Raise Up Massachusetts coalition, which led the ballot campaign to pass the surtax, also defended the Legislature’s approach.
“The Constitution doesn’t allow specific appropriations in a ballot measure, so it gives the Legislature the ability to spend the money on the priorities that they choose, and we expect that those priorities may shift and evolve as time goes on,” said Andrew Farnitano, a spokesperson for the coalition.
Farnitano pointed to the strength of surtax revenue collections as a sign the funding stream can be relied upon for major investments. 
“The intention of the amendment was to give the state the resources to make these decisions and have these conversations through the budget process, where we have the resources that are necessary,” he said.
When asked about concerns over the volatility of surtax revenues — which depend on high-income earners  — Farnitano responded, “The evidence so far is showing that Fair Share revenues are very strong and can be counted upon.”
Indeed, the Department of Revenue reported in May that it had collected nearly $2.6 billion from the surtax between July 1, 2024 and April 30, 2025 — exceeding the total for all of fiscal 2024 with two months of fiscal 2025 still to be counted. Secretary of Administration and Finance Matthew Gorzkowicz has said total fiscal 2025 surtax collections could approach $3 billion.
Meanwhile, general tax collections have plateaued.
From the House floor Monday, House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz made the case for moving Chapter 70 obligations into the surtax category.
“This shift will further limit any potential exposure with general fund revenue while holding to our commitment to fully fund the fifth year of the Student Opportunity Act,” he said. “This reduction in overall spending will better prepare the commonwealth for potential economic turmoil in the months ahead.”
Senate Ways and Means Chair Michael Rodrigues’ office also cited the unexpectedly high surtax receipts as a factor in the decision to expand its use. 
“In light of higher than initially estimated Fair Share collections, we felt comfortable increasing the conference amount to allow for transformative investments in education and transportation,” said Rodrigues spokesperson Sean Fitzgerald.
Still, critics worry about setting a precedent that allows baseline education costs to be paid for with what was pitched to voters as a tool for innovation.
“While we understand FY2026 presents fiscal challenges, Massachusetts has one of the strongest rainy day funds in the country; reserves that exist precisely to help us sustain progress during hard times,” Imboden said. “Now is the moment to honor the will of the voters and ensure that Fair Share dollars are used to move us forward, not simply to hold the line.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — LGBTQ+ supporters are relaunching a bipartisan advocacy group in an effort to provide a more centrist conversation amid increasingly hateful rhetoric. 
The Equality Network which launched last week aims to change the narrative surrounding LGBTQ+ legislation in an environment that has become “a form of tribalism and partisanship that we’ve never seen,” said Troy Stevenson, executive director of the network. 
By providing a more centrist conversation the network hopes to share the stories of LGBTQ+ Oklahomans and reach across the aisle to generate productive and informed conversation between lawmakers.
“So as Democrats and Republicans and independents …, we intend to move forward in that direction and make sure that we’re going out and having conversations and doing more listening than talking and doing more of everything than judging,” Stevenson said.
The Equality Network, which started in 2009, merged with the Cimarron Alliance Foundation to form Freedom Oklahoma in 2015. Stevenson previously led The Equality Network before launching Freedom Oklahoma to tackle a growing number of anti-LGQBT+ bills being filed in the Legislature.
The resurrected network is focused on presenting policy to the Legislature that contains research and data explaining the positive and negative impacts of the proposed legislation to help spur more informed conversation. 
Stevenson said their work in the upcoming session will focus on “making sure they don’t do anything horrible to our kids.”
Its membership is bipartisan, a move the group hopes will reshape the conversion.
Republican Labor Commissioner Leslie Osborn said her involvement in the network stems from her daughter, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, who moved to Canada because she felt unwelcome. 
“I don’t think that’s acceptable in America,” she said. “Who you love should never have been ingrained in a government issue or political issue.”
In recent years, Oklahoma has seen a growing number of anti-LGBTQ+ measures filed, which range from cracking down on the books children can access in school libraries that contain content regarding sexual sexual lifestyles to banning gender-affirming health care for minors and drag shows in public.
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, said the core of the network “is about personal freedom, freedom from intolerance, freedom from big government intrusion into someone’s personal life.” 
“Love is love, and people should be free to be their own authentic selves, without big brother government interfering in that life,” he said.
Composed of a two-member staff, The Equality Network, which will be based in Oklahoma City, does not have a finalized budget yet, however, it intends to work with other LGTBQ+ foundations for funding.
Stevenson said they are partnering with Oklahomans for Equality in hopes to host town hall meetings across Oklahoma. 
Oklahomans For Equality did not return messages seeking comment.
Nicole McAfee, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, said they weren’t familiar with the relaunch of The Equality Network.
“There’s always room for more folks fighting for 2SLGBTQ+ liberation in and beyond the Oklahoma Capitol.” McAfee said. “We’re excited to connect with folks seeking new opportunities to engage in the process.”

(Getty Images)TOPEKA — An examination of Sedgwick County’s bail system found practices that exacerbate inequality within the criminal justice system, leading advocates to request change.
A key finding from a recently released report from the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas revealed that the county’s bail system “penalizes poverty, perpetuates racial disparities, and undermines the presumption of innocence.”
The report found that the money bail system in Sedgwick County, home to Wichita, results in many people who haven’t yet been convicted of a crime spending more time in jail because they can’t afford to pay for their release ahead of a trial.
Lindsay Callender, a policy associate with the ACLU of Kansas, said pretrial jail time should be reserved for ensuring court appearances, preventing harm to the public and avoiding judicial interference.
“But instead, many people spend up to months behind bars awaiting trial for low-level, nonviolent offenses simply because they can’t post bond, regardless of their guilt or innocence,” Callender said in a news release.
Judges in Kansas often apply bail uniformly, the report said, without consideration for individual circumstances.
The report urged judges to set bonds, the conditions of a person’s release on bail, based not on a set schedule but on individual assessments of flight risk, the danger to the public and financial standing.
The average total bond amount for people charged with crimes in Sedgwick County is more than $104,000, while the average income is less than $90,000. The median income is lower at around $66,000.
The median bond amount for people facing nonviolent charges in Sedgwick County is $1,500, which the report said can be burdensome for low-income groups.
The report found that Sedgwick County’s bail system mostly punishes people accused of committing nonviolent crimes, making up about 84% of all charges awaiting trial. More than half of those charges were tied to procedural violations, which the ACLU attributed to issues of poverty or substance use. Around 15% of the nonviolent charges were drug-related.
Men make up the majority of the population in the Sedgwick County jail. Black individuals make up around one-third of the jail population and about 9% of the county’s general population.
The report said the racial and gender inequalities “in Sedgwick County’s bail system are extreme even by standards of the American justice system.”
It continued: “Black individuals are more likely to be charged, held on bail, held longer, and held on higher amounts. Women, who make up just over a quarter of the incarcerated population, face distinct and compounded hardships, from financial strain to exacerbated mental health challenges.”
A majority of Kansas voters that the ACLU polled statewide in 2023 expressed concern about inequalities in the state’s criminal legal system. More than half of those polled said the system carries “different standards of justice for the rich and the poor.”
Micah Kubic, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas, said the issues within Sedgwick County’s bail system didn’t come from nowhere. It is directly tied to “decades of over-policing, surveillance, and disinvestment in vulnerable neighborhoods,” Kubic said.
Bail policy is set by statute in Kansas, leaving change up to legislators. A small handful of states have abolished commercial bail bonds, including Nebraska, and others have implemented reforms, which can include personal recognizance bonds. Those allow someone charged with a crime to be released from jail before a trial, but it is dependent on the person showing up for court.
The report suggested the Sedgwick County District Attorney, whose office did not respond to requests for comment, issue a memo requiring its staff to seek personal recognizance bonds for all defendants charged with crimes that don’t involve other people. Assault, murder and rape would be exempt for this requirement, and the report recommends the office tailor any cash bail amounts to the individual’s circumstances, including ability to pay.
Kubic said elected officials have an opportunity to alleviate cycles of harm within Sedgwick County’s bail system.
“Sedgwick County’s money bail system causes financial destruction, employment disruption, and strain on familial relationships that lead to broader socioeconomic consequences for communities — and it makes all of us less safe,” Kubic said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scales-of-justice-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

(Photo by Chloe Bennett-Steele/StateImpact Oklahoma)In Norman, scientists are working to significantly speed up tornado warnings while finding new paths to understanding deadly storms and protecting lives and property. A cooperative institute with more than 220 employees is studying ways to update weather radar facilities, investigate the dynamics of severe storms and more.
But the years-long research projects are at risk of termination under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) most recent budget estimate.
A document published Monday details the deep funding cuts to the nation’s leading weather and climate agency, which would result in the termination of the National Severe Storms Lab (NSSL) and the University of Oklahoma’s Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CIWRO).
StateImpact previously reported that the Trump administration sought to eliminate NOAA’s research arm, which includes the NSSL. The new budget is a detailed version of the passback document released in April. A request for comment from U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, went unanswered. U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin also did not respond.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. James Lankford said he would continue to monitor the budget request during the appropriations process.
“Senator Lankford believes NOAA and the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman do essential work in early detection, forecasting and research,” the spokesperson said in an email.
The latest plan states that a fraction of NSSL research funds would be funneled to the National Weather Service. It’s unclear whether the weather service would use the money for continued research or to cover operational costs.
Two large research projects led by the NSSL would be terminated. The Warn-on-Forecast is creating a system to increase tornado warning lead times, which are usually just a few minutes long. In 2024, the program resulted in a 75-minute lead for residents in Iowa.
The VORTEX USA project is a collaboration between meteorologists and social scientists to determine why tornadoes in the Southeast are more deadly than in other places. The program began in 2015, primarily developed by the NSSL.
“NOAA will evaluate options for supporting these specific activities within the NWS in the future,” the document reads.
Climate research and public information 
The budget request would terminate funding for many organizations focused on climate, weather and oceans. In Norman, the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program works with communities on hazard mitigation plans. The documents are usually stepping stones to getting federal funds after a natural disaster.
The program, located within the National Weather Center, is funded by NOAA grants and would likely be eliminated under the budget proposal.
Climate change is widely targeted throughout the budget request to recenter the agency’s focus on weather, according to the document. But meteorologists say the cuts will likely also disrupt scientists’ understanding of naturally occurring weather patterns.
“By eliminating climate research, we’re eliminating a lot of research that is separate from climate change and has direct societal benefits, like better understanding the El Niño, La Niña phenomenon, being able to understand how to make longer-range monthly to seasonal outlooks,” said Alan Gerard, meteorologist and former NSSL employee. “All of that benefits agriculture, benefits business.”
The news came the same day the website that hosts The National Climate Assessment shut down. The report includes details on how local communities are impacted by warming temperatures and other effects of human-caused climate change.
Both changes reflect the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate federally funded work on climate research.
The final budget will be decided by Congress, which has until the end of September to vote on the spending or provide interim funds for an extension.

Kay Ivey’s office said Wednesday it plans to name a member of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles within the next few days, whether or not that’s Chair Leigh Gwathney.
“The governor is in receipt of the list of nominations. She is reviewing and will make a determination by the Monday deadline,” Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement Wednesday.
Gwathney’s fate has become the subject of public contention, with the board’s falling level of parole grants and responsiveness to the Legislature at the center of the discussion.
In a letter released Tuesday, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and several sheriffs and prosecutors praised Gwathney and urged Gov. Kay Ivey to reappoint her to another term amid concerns from civil rights groups about declining parole rates and attempts to flaunt oversight from the Legislature.
“Reappointing Leigh Gwathney is about more than leadership — it’s about protecting Alabama families from violent criminals and honoring the voices of victims who too often go unheard,” the letter said. “Ms. Gwathney has never lost sight of what’s at stake: the safety of our citizens and the dignity of those who have suffered at the hands of violent offenders.”
Ivey will choose from a list of candidates submitted by the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives and the Alabama Senate president pro tempore.
Marshall, as well as sheriffs, police chiefs and prosecutors, commended Gwathney’s commitment to public safety.
“More importantly, her willingness to continue to serve in the face of unprecedented and unwarranted criticism by the liberal media shows a level of courage, conviction, and dedication to the cause that is rarely seen in Montgomery,” Marshall said in the letter. “Ms. Gwathney has earned the trust and respect of law enforcement, prosecutors, and crime victims across our state, all of whom now have a stake in seeing her reappointed.”
Gwathney was appointed to the board in 2019 after the Legislature made a series of changes to parole laws following the 2017 release of Jimmy O’Neal Spencer. Spencer, who was misclassified in the system, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2022 of murdering three people during a series of robberies in 2018. The victims included a 7-year-old child. The Legislature enacted a law that set stricter rules and regulations for applicants to be granted parole, especially if they commit violent offenses.
Parole rates have plummeted under Gwathney’s tenure, going from more than 50% in 2017 to 8% in 2023 before increasing to about 26% in 2025.
Criminal justice advocates have criticized the parole board for declining parole rates and not adhering to parole guidelines. The guidelines, though not binding on the board, are meant to serve as a guide for the parole board to follow when making parole determinations.
Along with the declining parole rates, the conformance rate, the frequency with which the parole board follows the guidelines, has also declined to the point that members’ decisions align with the parole guidelines only about a quarter of the time.
At an October meeting of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee, Gwathney struggled to answer direct questions about the parole guidelines and the board’s apparent lack of conformance with them when determining parole.
Over the past year, several lawmakers proposed legislation aimed at reforming the parole board, even going as far as to make funding for the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles contingent on the members adopting updated parole guidelines as required by the law.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_002-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) on the House floor on May 1, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonIn Michigan, where voters in 2022 approved enshrining the right to an abortion into the state constitution, legislation that would classify elective abortions as homicide has been introduced.
Last week, Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) introduced House Bills 4670 and 4671 to create the “justice for babies in the womb act”. The bill aims to adjust all definitions in assault, assault and battery, and homicide cases to apply to “an unborn child in the same manner as they would if the victim were an individual who had been born alive”.
The proposed legislation, which was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, seeks to extend legal personhood to fetuses and fertilized embryos and would allow for women who receive abortions to be charged with homicide. 
The bills would be unlikely to pass through Michigan’s Democratic-led Senate which has approved several measures to implement the constitutional right to reproductive health care, including abortions. However, the legislation has been applauded by anti-abortion advocates, including former Planned Parenthood clinic director turned anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson whose story is the premise of the 2019 movie “Unplanned”.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Another equal protection bill has been introduced in Michigan by @JoshuaSchriver and needs your support!,” Johnson posted on “X”. “It’s time to make our voices heard!!! Abortion is murder! I am proud to support Michigan house bills 4670/4671.”
The bills outline that the unintentional death of a fetus or fertilized embryo would not be subject to the outlined criminal penalties if it were the result of “a life‐saving procedure to save the life of the mother if accompanied by reasonable steps to save the life of the unborn child.”
The Foundation to Abolish Abortion applauded the bills’ introduction in a news release this week with the president of the foundation, Bradley Pierce calling the bills’ “righteous legislation”.
“House Bill 4671 is the first legislation in Michigan state history that would establish equal protection of the laws for preborn children,” Pierce said. “This bill would simply make murdering anyone illegal for everyone, in recognition that preborn babies are image-bearers of God and are just as worthy of legal protection as people who have already been born.
Since 57% of Michigan voters approved the constitutional amendment to add the right to reproductive health care including abortions to the state constitution, there have been unconstitutional efforts to subvert that decision, Chief External Affairs Officer at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan Ashlea Phenicie said in a statement Wednesday.
 “In 2022, Michiganders voted in record numbers to permanently enshrine reproductive freedom into our state constitution… Bills like HB4671 are just empty political grandstanding pushed by anti-abortion extremists who are out-of-step with Michiganders’ values,” Phenicie said. “While it’s unlikely to pass into law, it proves yet again how committed they are to defying the will of voters to control our bodies, lives, and futures.”
Several other states, including Georgia, Indiana, North Dakota and Texas have introduced bills in the same vein.
A request for comment was made by Michigan Advance to Schriver, but has yet to be returned.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)The state of Iowa has issued an emergency order suspending the license of a mental health counselor accused of improper sexual activity with two patients.
According to the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals, Giovanni Demezier of Davenport was issued an Iowa mental health counselor’s license in May 2021.
The board alleges Demezier began providing counseling services to a female patient, identified in board records as T.S., in January 2024. The counseling sessions took place in the patient’s home and at some point during the counseling relationship, Demezier allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with the patient.
According to the board, the patient alleges that after the two engaged in sexual relations, Demezier told her he needed to switch her from counseling to coaching services and had her sign a new contract for such services — implying that this made their sexual relationship permissible.

Demezier further stated to that it was “normal” to engage in sexual relationships with clients and that he “does it all the time,” the board alleges.
T.S. later became pregnant and believes Demezier is the father. Demezier allegedly provided money to T.S. to terminate the pregnancy, but it was too late for such a procedure once she discovered she was pregnant, according to the board.
The board states that Demezier was interviewed and admitted to having sexual contact with T.S.
Court records indicate Demezier worked for Davenport’s QC Counselor at the time of the alleged relationship. Police records indicate T.S. provided police with screenshots of text conversations with Demezier that included references to sexual activity, a pregnancy, and the change in their relationship from counselor to coach.
The police records also indicate QC Counselor said, in response to a subpoena, that Demezier had left the company on Aug. 21, 2024, and that he had retained all client records upon his departure.
On May 14, 2025, police executed a search warrant at Demezier’s residence and seized a laptop computer from his home office. The laptop was then sent to Johnson County Joint Forensic Analysis Cyber Team in Coralville for forensic examination.
No criminal charges have been filed in the case.
Board: Advances made toward second patient 
The Board of Behavioral Health Professionals also alleges that in 2021, Demezier began counseling services with a previous client, M.R., via telehealth sessions.
Approximately two years into the counseling relationship, Demezier introduced the idea of switching M.R. from counseling to coaching, claiming it would be more affordable, according to the board.
On Aug. 2, 2023, the patient became a client of Demezier’s private practice, after which Demezier allegedly encouraged her to communicate with him more frequently via his personal cellphone. According to the board, Demezier assured M.R. the rules were different given their new coaching relationship.
According to the board, M.R. claims that on Oct. 28, 2024, Demezier initiated a sexual conversation with her via text message. “The patient felt scared, trapped, and intimidated by the situation and the sexual comments” made by Demezier, the board alleges. She terminated the relationship with Demezier via email message on Oct. 31, 2024.
In connection with the allegations involving T.S. and M.R, the board has charged Demezier with improper sexual contact with a patient or making suggestive or lewd remarks or advances to a patient; failure to comply with a national code of ethics, and engaging in sexual activities or sexual contact with a client.
The board recently concluded Demezier had engaged in sexual contact with a client and engaged in improper sexual behavior toward a second client, making him “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.”
As a result, the board has issued an emergency order immediately suspending his license. Additional action may be taken after a hearing on the charges has been held.

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order.”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

The lawsuit says federal agents are stopping people only for being Latino, placing them in ‘deplorable conditions’ and not allowing them to speak with an attorney. 



A lawsuit filed Wednesday by civil and immigration rights groups accuses federal authorities of unleashing an unconstitutional siege by snatching workers and U.S. citizens off Southern California streets and denying them food, water and the right to speak with an attorney. 
The federal class action lawsuit aims to immediately stop immigration agents from conducting military-style raids across L.A. that prioritize “numbers, pure numbers,” according to the complaint. It also seeks to get access to counsel for those arrested who are now being held in overcrowded “dungeon-like” facilities where the conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional, the filing says.  
Federal agents in combat gear, some masked and armed with rifles, have stormed swap meets, car washes, bus stops, and churches since early June, grabbing people off sidewalks and dragging away mothers, workers, day laborers, and U.S. citizens without explanation, the complaint alleges. Civil rights groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, say the raids have been part of an illegal mass-arrest campaign driven by the Trump administration’s nationwide deportation quota policy. 
“Such seizures look less like lawful arrests and more like brazen, midday kidnappings,” the lawsuit states.  
In late May, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller issued a directive to Immigration and Customs Enforcement to make 3,000 immigration-related arrests every day, and stated there would be “consequences for not hitting arrest targets,” the lawsuit says, referencing a story in the Wall Street Journal. 
“Since early June, this District has been under siege,” the complaint states. The lawsuit is brought by the ACLU, Public Counsel, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, among others. It names Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol, and the FBI as defendants. 
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the raids have been “highly targeted.”
“Any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted’ by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE,” she wrote in an email. “These type (sic) of smears are designed to demonize and villainize our brave ICE law enforcement. This kind of garbage has led to a more than 700 percent increase in the assaults on enforcement officers. Politicians, activists, and “journalists” must turn the temperature down and tone down their rhetoric.”
Federal officials made similar claims about similar raids conducted in Kern County in January. After the ACLU challenged the raids in court, a federal judge later found they likely violated the Constitution’s ban on unreasonable searches, issuing a preliminary injunction banning those raids in the Central Valley. 
The new suit makes the same arguments about the Los Angeles raids. 
‘They don’t care if you have papers’ 
Filed on behalf of five individuals and four advocacy groups, including the United Farm Workers, the filing documents a sprawling crackdown that has targeted dozens of locations across Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties, terrorizing mostly Latino neighborhoods in the process. Among those locations are at least 15 Home Depot parking lots, nine car washes, a Santa Ana park, a swap meet in Santa Fe Springs, and several churches. 
The suit argues that agents are detaining people solely based on their race, clothing or occupation, which would be a violation of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and the Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process. 
“They don’t care if you have papers, as long as you look like what they want you to look like, they’ll take you,” recalled one witness who saw agents take away a dark-skinned man who only spoke Spanish from the Downey Memorial Christian Church on June 11. 
Another witness said she saw federal agents pulling people from the bathrooms during a military-style raid at a popular Los Angeles swap meet with 60 heavily armed agents. Videos taken from the scene of that crackdown show armed agents dressed in camouflage, some of whom wore masks concealing their identities. Border Patrol made a video boasting about its actions there. 
“If you looked Hispanic in any way, they just took you,” the witness said, according to the complaint. 
In Culver City, agents descended on a car wash on June 8 dressed in either camouflage fatigues or plainclothes, driving unmarked cars. One witness saw an agent carrying an assault rifle while running after a customer across a four-lane road. Other terrified customers shouted, “Don’t shoot!” In Westchester, that same day, armed agents in camouflage and helmets tackled a fruit vendor to the ground, according to the suit. 
In Orange County, on June 6, agents surrounded and questioned Latino men painting a house while ignoring white neighbors in nearby yards. 
U.S. citizens taken
Among those detained was Heidi Plummer, a U.S. citizen who got caught up in an immigration raid while taking a walk through a park in Santa Ana on June 14. She was handcuffed, put in a vehicle with others, and taken to a station and held for an hour and a half before she was released, the complaint states. 
Andrea Velez, another U.S. citizen, was being dropped off at work in downtown Los Angeles when she was grabbed without explanation and without anyone asking her for her identification. Her mother, who witnessed the attack, said it looked like “they’re kidnapping her.” 
“The only thing wrong with her … was the color of her skin,” said her mother, according to the lawsuit. 
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege federal agents have no prior information about the people they’re detaining, nor any warrants. They allege the agents are arresting people without considering whether or not they pose a flight risk before a warrant can be obtained, in violation of federal law. They also claim the agents are not identifying themselves or telling people why they’re being arrested, also in violation of federal law. 
Detention ‘conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional’ 
ICE detention capacity is buckling under the surge in arrests, causing the agency to hold people in a basement area in Los Angeles known as “B-18.” The basement is meant to be a short-term processing center for ICE, but now people are facing prolonged confinement there without access to attorneys, according to the complaint. The Immigration and Nationality Act says people have the right to call an attorney while in immigration detention. 
There, detainees have reported having little access to food or water. They say the holding areas have been so crowded that there hasn’t been space to sit or lay down. 
“In these dungeon-like facilities, conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional,” the complaint states. Facing the awful conditions at that site and others, some people have been pressured into accepting “voluntary departure,” the complaint says, which helps federal authorities continue to arrest more people. 
McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for Homeland Security, denied the accusations in the lawsuit about conditions inside ICE facilities. 
“Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false. In fact, ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens,” McLaughlin said.
McLaughlin said all detainees are provided proper meals that are certified by dieticians, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and family members.   
“This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she added. 
The 65-page complaint asks the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to block federal immigration agents from continuing the raids, declare their tactics unconstitutional, and allow access to counsel for those who have been swept up and detained. 
“Despite the fear and risks associated with speaking publicly,” the lawsuit says, the plaintiffs are “taking courageous action to enforce the rule of law.” 
The organizations that are part of the lawsuit are: the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers and the Immigrant Defenders Law Center.

This story was originally published by ProPublica. 
One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.
It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.
In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.
In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.
By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.
But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.
These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.
At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.
Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”
“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”
In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.
“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.
That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)
Scientists and advocates also said it’s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.
“I don’t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don’t understand it.”
Delays, confusion over PFAS
Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”
Without explanation, EPA restores some grants for PFAS research in Maine

The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA’s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.
Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump’s first term. Zeldin’s EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.
The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.
Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.
The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”
The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.
When Biden’s EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.
Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.
When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.

In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don’t benefit public health.”
The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.
“It’s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.
Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.
A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)
Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”
PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.
Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they’re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they’re angry.
“I feel like we’re walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”
“It’s one thing to say you’re going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It’s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”
Research under fire
The EPA of Trump’s first term didn’t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.
In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina’s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”
Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.
At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.
Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year’s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.
In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The contrast between the agency’s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State’s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.
“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we’re doing is we’re undermining our ability to translate the science that we’re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”
At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.
About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”
Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”
Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don’t know how much longer we will be operating as is.”
The EPA told ProPublica that it’s “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump’s first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.
The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.
“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”
The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA’s workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.
“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency’s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-DrinkingWater-PFAS-Getty.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

The state experienced unusually high spring temperatures and an average (in some areas, below average) snowpack, which led to a quick runoff season. 
Now, with summer underway, more than 90% of the state is either in moderate or severe drought, with some high elevation areas in central Utah classified as abnormally dry.

“Temperatures have soared, and with that comes a natural increase in outdoor watering,” said Utah Division of Water Resources Director Candice Hasenyager. “We want our lawns and gardens to look nice and there are ways to do this through smart planning and new technologies that save water.”
According to the division, reservoir levels around the state remain at about 8% higher than normal for this time of the year. In northern Utah, Strawberry, Deer Creek, Jordanelle, Rockport, Smith and Morehouse, Echo, East Canyon and Pineview reservoirs are all at about 90% capacity or higher. 
As of Wednesday, the Great Salt Lake was at about 4,192 feet in elevation, slightly below the state’s “ecologically healthy” level of 4,198 feet. Utah Lake was at about 91% capacity. 
Hot and windy weather prompts statewide fire restrictions and a call for prayer

But with the drought worsening and peak summer temperatures still ahead, water levels in the state’s lakes and reservoirs are expected to drop. 
“Right now, we’re generally seeing outflows from reservoirs begin to exceed inflows,” Hasenyager said. “That pattern typically sets in later in the summer, but this year’s heat is accelerating things. Across all sectors, we need to look for ways to be efficient with our finite water supply.”
The drought prompted Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to declare a state of emergency in 17 counties earlier this spring
The executive order allows farmers and ranchers to access low-interest loans from the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food. Agricultural producers in Beaver, Carbon, Emery, Garfield, Grand, Iron, Juab, Kane, Millard, Piute, San Juan, Sanpete, Sevier, Tooele, Uintah, Washington and Wayne counties can apply to receive up to $100,000, with loans available until the end of October. 
The drought is also contributing to the high fire danger in Utah. So far this year, the state has seen more than 52,000 acres burned in 438 fires. 
That includes the Forsyth Fire, which as of Wednesday afternoon was at about 13,419 acres and 42% contained, and the 33,362-acre France Canyon Fire, which is now 64% contained.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina deviated from party leadership to cast a vote in the negative.,"The U.S. Capitol on Sunday, June 29, 2025. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate narrowly passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” on Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote.
Senators voted 51-50, mostly along party lines. All Democrats voted in opposition, as well as three Republicans.
Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who announced Sunday that he will not seek reelection in 2026, deviated from party leadership to cast a vote in the negative.
The measure, if passed, would make drastic cuts to Medicaid, SNAP benefits, and student loan payment programs, to name a few components.
Here’s a look at how North Carolina’s congressional delegation is responding to the bill moving forward.
Tillis goes against his party
Tillis, a moderate Republican, joined fellow GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky to stray from party lines and vote against the bill.
He specifically voiced concern over the bill’s impact on Medicaid, saying the Senate draft contains “significant” changes that would be “devastating” to North Carolina.
“I did my homework on behalf of North Carolinians, and I cannot support this bill in its current form,” he wrote on social media.
Tillis added that the bill would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for the Tar Heel State, including in hospitals and rural communities.
Facing a primary challenge from a Trump-backed candidate, Tillis revealed just days before the vote that he would retire instead of running for reelection next year.
The move sets off a battle for the open seat in both major parties. Lara Trump and Roy Cooper appear to be frontrunners, but neither have declared their candidacy thus far.
Democrats rally against the measure
Rep. Alma Adams, representing North Carolina’s 12th congressional district, proposed an amendment to the budget bill on Wednesday as it appeared on the House floor.
The amendment “protects against any cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Adams said, asking to bring it in front of the chamber.
“The unanimous consent request cannot be entertained,” Republican Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said, shutting it down as he presided over the body.
Adams shared on social media about how Republicans “wouldn’t entertain” her amendment.
“We are going to keep fighting this One Big, Ugly Bill,” she wrote.
Rep. Deborah Ross of North Carolina’s second congressional district said she was back in Washington to vote against the bill.
It would “strip food assistance, health care, climate change support all from the American people and give huge tax breaks to billionaires,” she said in a video she posted online.
Ross pointed out that Vance had to vote on the topic.
“Even our Senator Thom Tillis could see through what this is going to do to people’s health care,” she said.
Other Republicans continue to back the measure
Aside from Tillis, North Carolina’s congressional Republicans have voiced their support for the budget bill.
Rep. Richard Hudson of the ninth congressional district has been one of the most vocal members from the state to defend the measure.
Hudson sent off a flurry of posts online outlining claims that Democrats are working against the American people.
He posted a series of messages saying, “if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn’t pass, it will have disastrous effects on…” ending with the economy, border security, national security, and fiscal trajectory.
“Today, House Republicans will vote to prevent the largest tax increase in American history,” Hudson posted Wednesday morning.
Gov. Josh Stein urges opposition
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein issued a letter on Wednesday to the North Carolina congressional delegation asking members to vote against the legislation.
He explicitly highlighted his “deep concern” for changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and tax credits for energy and manufacturing.
Stein said the bill poses both immediate and long-term threats to the health and wellbeing of North Carolinians, as well as the state’s economic stability.
“This bill has moved at a breakneck pace, leaving North Carolinians without ample time to provide feedback on the devastating impacts this would have on our state,” he wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitoljune292025_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

“Every contribution made through these official channels goes directly toward supporting the families in their time of unimaginable loss and need,” the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
The brush fire officials believe the suspect caused, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 38 acres by Tuesday morning, largely because of better mapping, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The fire is not contained.
The U.S. Forest Service on Tuesday closed roads near Canfield Mountain until July 15, unless the order ends earlier. A temporary flight restriction is still in effect for the area. Flying drones or aircraft in the area without authorization poses “a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities,” Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Structures are still not at risk from the fire, and no evacuations have been ordered, Department of Lands officials say. The fire is in steep terrain.
Crews on Tuesday will work to contain the fire by installing hose lays and setting up water access for the fire’s perimeter, officials say. Fire operations on Tuesday also changed from the Idaho Department of Lands’ Mica Fire Protection District to the North Idaho Type 3 Incident Management Team.
The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts. The fire’s cause remains under investigation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-02 17:51:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT employee union takes Lamont to arbitration after no raise offer,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/02/ct-employee-union-ned-lamont-arbitration/,"After the unit announced its plans, SEBAC said it ‘would not expect a single one of our units to accept’ Lamont’s wage freeze proposal.","While weighing a third term, Gov. Ned Lamont asked a key part of his political base — unionized state employees — to accept a wage freeze despite his administration projecting the second-largest budget surplus in Connecticut history.
The 1,300-member Judicial Professional Employees Union announced arbitration plans Wednesday afternoon and is one of just 35 state bargaining units working under contracts that expired Tuesday. But other worker groups, which still are negotiating with the Lamont administration, are expected to have received similar no-raise proposals.
“Negotiation teams representing their colleagues have been working tirelessly at each of the 35 bargaining tables to reach agreement on successor contracts that address pay and other issues,” Drew Stoner, spokeswoman of the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, or SEBAC, wrote in a statement. “However, after months of bargaining, our first unit has declared impasse.”
Stoner added the judicial professionals’ union, which represents probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other support staff, had asked for a 2.5% cost-of-living increase in the new fiscal year that began Tuesday, as well as a step hike for all but the most senior workers. A step hike typically adds another 2 percentage points to the value of the raise. This would match the increase Lamont negotiated, and legislators approved this past May, for state police troopers.
SEBAC, which includes all major state employee unions excluding the troopers’ unit, added that the administration’s offer for judicial professions “was no wage increase, no step, and no top step payment. We would not expect a single one of our units to accept this offer.”
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Wednesday, “The administration plans to present an offer to SEBAC regarding wages and work conditions as soon as next week. … Governor Lamont immensely values the contributions of our state employees, as evidenced by consistent wage increases and our offer will reflect that.”
Since Lamont became governor in 2019, his administration largely has negotiated matching pay hikes for all state employee unions.
And since 2021, as Connecticut has enjoyed unprecedented surpluses driven by aggressive and increasingly controversial budget caps, most unionized workers have received effective annual raises of 4.5%. That reflects a 2.5% cost of living adjustment and a yearly step increase.
Since those budget caps last were set in 2017, annual surpluses have averaged $1.8 billion, a huge sum that represents 8% to 9% of the General Fund. And the governor’s budget office projected two weeks ago that Connecticut would close the 2024-25 fiscal year with nearly $2.2 billion or 10% left over.
Though the outgoing fiscal year closed on Monday, the comptroller’s office won’t complete a final audit until September.
Despite those surpluses, and projections for more black ink in the next few years, the governor and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority adopted a new, $55.8 billion, biennial budget that assumed most unionized employees would not be getting their raises on time this July 1.
Legislators struggled to find enough room under the constitutional spending cap — which keeps most budget growth in line with household income and inflation — to cover raises and planned new investments in child care, municipal aid and education.
The expectation, though, was that workers still would receive an increase for the 2025-26 fiscal year, but that it would be delivered retroactively in 2026-27, when there would be more projected room to spend under the constitutional cap.
But despite the large surpluses, Lamont and state officials also are wary that Connecticut will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual Medicaid payments and other grants from Washington, D.C., as part of ongoing efforts by Congress and President Donald J. Trump to slash federal spending.Critics say budget caps were calibrated arbitrarily and the huge, post-2017 “surpluses” don’t reflect non-essential resources, but rather vital dollars stripped from education, health care, and other core programs to build state reserves and reduce Connecticut’s considerable pension debt.
The state entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Those obligations, coupled with bonded debt and funds owed to other retirement benefits programs, collectively approach $79 billion, making Connecticut one of the most indebted states, per capita, in the nation.
But much of that debt was due to poor savings habits over seven decades, between 1939 and 2010. And given that pension debt — even at the current pace Connecticut is paying it down — is projected to place pressure on state finances well into the 2040s, critics say Lamont is placing too much pressure on one generation to solve a problem created by three.
State employee unions have been some of the most vocal critics of those caps, and say they’ve led to dangerous understaffing levels in many agencies and departments.
“Our state workforce is the backbone of public safety, infrastructure, education and health — and the first line of defense when federal resources are held back,” Stoner added. “Yet with no contract in place, Lamont is asking workers to hold the line with one hand tied behind their backs. … Governor Lamont must recognize this reality and empower his representatives to  agree to fair and honorable contracts.”
The governor, a fiscal moderate, is expected to announce later this summer whether he will run in 2026 for a third term in office.
At a June 5 press conference, one day after the General Assembly closed the regular 2024 session, the governor gave his strongest indication to date of an inclination to seek another four-year term with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.
“I love the job,” he said. “I think we’ve had extraordinary progress compared to where we were, say, 10 years ago. I think Susan and I are a pretty good team.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC03422-e1541205352185.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Courtesy of Angel Peña) A U.S. Customs and Border Protection proposal to construct a 1.3-mile barrier along the southern skirt of a Sunland Park mountain threatens the area, local conservation groups say.
Most of Mount Cristo Rey lies in southern Doña Ana County, rising from the banks of the Rio Grande in an expanse of Chihuahuan desert, mottled with olive-green chaparral and ocotillo. The mountain hosts a 29-foot tall limestone statue of Jesus Christ on the cross, and draws thousands of people every year in pilgrimage from the surrounding areas in Las Cruces, El Paso and Juárez. The area is also a popular hiking and mountain biking area.
The proposal would widen roads to construct a 30-foot high steel barrier and an additional one and a half miles of roadway in Doña Ana County. The wall would stretch over the mountain’s southern portion, which stretches to the Anapra neighborhood in Juárez.

In announcing the project at the start of June, the Department of Homeland Security said it would “close critical gaps in the border wall and enhance border security operations” in the border areas in El Paso, Tucson and Yuma.
When reached by phone, CBP spokesperson Landon Hutchison added that Mount Cristo Rey “was a major human smuggling infiltration site for the cartels.”

Also in June, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem waived federal environment and water laws to speed up border wall construction projects, including more than 12 miles between Santa Teresa and Mount Cristo Rey. The waivers exempt projects from requirements of 24 federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) whose district encompasses Sunland Park, declined to say if he supports the project when reached for comment.
“I support responsible efforts to keep our border secure and our communities safe. That includes smart investments in technology and, where needed, physical barriers,” Vasquez said in a written statement. “We can keep our country safe while also respecting the environment, cultural heritage, and the people who call this region home.”










“I think by expanding the border wall, you threaten to turn this place of recreation, this place of worship, into a graveyard”


– Dr. Brian Elmore, El Paso emergecy room doctor


Members of El Paso-Las Cruces coalition No Border Walls on Mount Cristo Rey, however, urged the public to submit public comments on the project  — which they say threatens to worsen migrant deaths, erosion and habitat loss for the area — before a July 3 feedback deadline.
While CBP data shows border crossings declined by nearly 80% in the last year, deaths of people crossing the border in the area around El Paso and New Mexico have risen sharply since 2021, and, in 2024, it became the deadliest place for migrants to cross along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.

“It is pretty disheartening to see,” Antoinette Reyes, the Southern New Mexico coordinator for Sierra Club Rio Grande chapter, told Source NM. “By blocking off that section, which is already steep and difficult terrain as is, it forces people to go into more dangerous portions of the border to cross.”
Injuries from climbing over the walls can result in life-changing injuries, said Dr. Brian Elmore, an emergency room physician in El Paso. He’s treated people who fell from the border walls, which can cause severe ankle breaks, as well as head and back injuries. The summer’s heat, combined with difficult terrain, could pose additional concerns, he said.
“I think by expanding the border wall, you threaten to turn this place of recreation, this place of worship, into a graveyard,” Elmore said. “I would expect to see more people falling from the wall there, suffering heat injuries, in this area.”

Construction of the border wall would also require high water use for pouring concrete to reinforce the roads for heavy machinery, said Erik Meza, a coordinator for the Sierra Club Borderlands program in Tucson.
“They will probably need to widen some of those roads, so that means that they are going to start bulldozing some of the native vegetation of the area, reducing a habitat for species,” he said. “By compacting the soils, we’re probably going to have more water run-off and erosion.”
The area is crucial for species such as javelina and mule deer, but also the birds, reptiles and pollinators that cross the habitat, said Raymundo Aguilar, a member of the Juárez conservation group Colectivo Sierra de Juárez. He noted that scientists documented an endangered Mexican Gray wolf crossing the border in the area in 2017, and the construction of a wall with 4-inch gaps between steel bollards would prevent most species from moving freely.
“Protecting this corridor is not only urgent; it is a commitment to the life we share on both sides of the border,” Aguilar said in Spanish. “We believe that efforts should focus on restoring this connectivity, not fragmenting it.”

Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.

The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 17:32:45+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Everybody loves John’: Jackson mayor Horhn’s big party brings in big bucks,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/everybody-loves-john-jackson-mayor-horhns-big-party-brings-in-big-bucks/,Tuesday's gala was a spectacular party that helped generate half a million dollars in sponsorships for Jackson Mayor John Horhn's inauguration festivities.,"By Tuesday evening, the room where Jackson Mayor John Horhn took the oath of office between gospel performances by the Mississippi Mass Choir earlier in the day had transformed into a glittery gala, replete with a red carpet, lit candles and a classically raunchy gig by blues musician Bobby Rush.
It was a spectacular party that helped generate half a million dollars in sponsorships for Tuesday’s inauguration festivities. More than 140 sponsors across Jackson made monetary and in-kind donations to celebrate Horhn, a longtime state senator from northwest Jackson, finally attaining the office he’d sought for 16 years.
“What better way to kick off and put the cap on such a monumental day, a momentous day, than to come out to the Jackson Convention Center and throw a party,” Horhn said after he took the stage.
All told, Horhn’s inauguration committee raised more than $485,000 in cash sponsorships and $150,000 in write-off donations to organize yesterday’s events, including the bash that was free and open to the public and featured food from more than 20 local businesses and a pricey cash bar. 
While the final tally of what was spent yesterday or how many people attended isn’t complete, Jeff Good, a local restaurateur who oversaw the committee’s finances, said he had budgeted about $320,000 for the day and estimated 2,500 attendees. Horhn will be able to use any leftover funds to put on future events. 
Each sponsor had a different motivation for donating, Good said. Some were local companies who have sought city contracts, while other Jacksonians made financial contributions simply because they are fans of Horhn. 
“There’s so many things that John has done,” Good said at the gala. “Everybody loves John.” 
While past mayors have thrown similar balls upon their inauguration, Horhn’s party was especially well-attended and inclusive, multiple attendees said. 
In the weeks leading up to the gala, the inauguration committee circulated a digital chart inviting people to sponsor the event at different levels from the lowest tier, called “spark” at a minimum of $500, all the way up to the “drum major” at $15,000 or more. 
Sponsors were to make the checks out to a 501(c)4 set up by the inauguration committee, Good said, and send them to a P.O. Box managed by Willie Bozeman, Horhn’s chief of staff and interim campaign manager. 
What did the sponsors get in exchange for their contribution? Good pointed at gigantic screens on either side of the gala’s main stage that listed the sponsor’s names. 
“We read their names on the podium,” he said. “They get the notoriety that they supported the mayor. It’s no different than if you’re doing a charity ball.” 
Sponsors also got dedicated tables, an invitation to a VIP reception, a swag bag and acknowledgement in the event program — a list that reads like a who’s who of Jackson and included developers like the Mattiace Company and Gabriel Prado, prominent law firms such as Butler Snow, nonprofits, lobbyists, engineering firms and well-known city construction contractors. 
“When you read the sponsorship list in our program, it is Jackson businesses, Jackson families, Jackson couples,” Good said. 
Cynics might say these donations will be used to get the mayor’s ear down the road.  
“Some folks are doing it to reap the benefits of contracts,” said David Archie, a former Hinds County commissioner recently hired by former Mayor Chokwe Lumumba after running for mayor himself, as he was looking for a table to sit at. “Some folks are doing it to be on the staff or to have family members on the staff.” 
But many others felt their sponsorship was more akin to a “thank you.” Carla Kirkland, the chief executive officer of an education consulting company that works with Jackson Public Schools, said she didn’t need to donate to get Horhn’s attention — she’s known him since he was a senator. 
Instead, Kirkland said she donated $15,000 to show Horhn that she has his back, much more than she’s given past mayoral administrations. 
“I think it shows the support that we are showing for the new administration and just letting them know that we are behind you,” she said. “We will put our money behind you, and we will put our name behind you.” 
Kirkland went even further, helping to fundraise for the gala, which she said was easy to do. Through her group chat network, she said she sold over 100 “spark” sponsorships. 
“I am in a GroupMe with the AKAs, with the Jack and Jills … with Women for Progress,” she said. “So I just pulled together my network.” 
The gala also proved to be a good networking opportunity: While talking to a reporter, Kirkland spotted Errick Greene, the Jackson Public Schools superintendent. He took a picture with Kirkland and her team.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/02120100/20250701_212641.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 17:25:34+00:00,Mississippi Today,Ridgeland nonprofit joins lawsuit over EPA’s funding pause,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/ridgeland-nonprofit-joins-lawsuit-over-epas-funding-pause/,Ridgeland nonprofit has joined a national lawsuit over EPA-terminated grants focused on climate resilience.,"2C Mississippi, a Ridgeland-based nonprofit focused on climate resilience in Mississippi, recently joined a national lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency after the government terminated over $20 million in grant funds for the organization.
In February, the lawsuit says, the EPA followed directives from President Trump to cut federal spending by terminating grants for a variety of environmental justice and climate resilience projects. Lawyers from a number of groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, filed the complaint in federal court in Washington D.C. on June 25. The complaint asks for full funding of the roughly 350 awarded grants impacted by the EPA’s cuts.
The Ridgeland organization, federal data shows, was set to receive about $20.5 million for two projects in Jackson: $20 million for a self-sustainable “resilience hub” and $500,000 to complete a “microparks” project aimed at tackling flooding and blight in the city. 2C Mississippi, one of the over 20 plaintiffs from around the country, received just $300,000 of those funds so far.
In a March memo the EPA sent to 2C Mississippi, the agency wrote, “This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”
Dominika Parry, who founded the nonprofit in 2017, called it a “nearly impossible task” to obtain the $20 million elsewhere for the resilience hub, a concept she said is growing around the country, such as in New Orleans. The idea, she explained, is to provide shelter both during emergencies but also during general times of need.

“ This is a place where people can come, stay overnight, have access to energy, be in healthy conditions,” Parry said. 
Features would include a tornado shelter, 150 beds, showers and charging stations, as well as job training and community spaces. Parry added the facility would be self-sustainable with an independent well water system as well as solar panels with battery storage. Working with Jackson nonprofit Voice of Calvary Ministries, Parry secured a site for the hub at a former church in west Jackson. 
The microparks project, which she discussed with Mississippi Today last year, seeks to take on both blight and flooding by turning dilapidated properties in flood zones into communal green spaces with public art and gardens. Despite having already selected the locations and cleared the land for the parks to live in, Parry said she’s had to pause the project since the EPA’s termination. She was optimistic that funding could come from elsewhere, but it’s unclear how long that would take. 
Without the grant money, Parry’s unsure if her organization as a whole can survive. Already, she said, she’s had to start working for free as well as reduce her employee’s salaries. 
“Losing that funding is a pretty existential change to our functioning,” she said.
In a separate project, 2C Mississippi secured a $1.5 million federal grant for a recently unveiled green space on Farish Street.
“So far we’ve been incredibly grateful and lucky that we were able to keep delivering and build trust, and now the idea we are going to go and tell people we don’t have the funds, that weighs on me,” Parry said. “People in Jackson have been promised many, many things that never happened.”
Other Mississippi groups whose grants were terminated include the Gulfport-based Steps Coalition and Jackson State University. Steps Coalition, according to federal data, received just $122,000 of a $500,000 grant to engage residents in local land-use and leadership training. JSU received about $60,000 of $100,000 from two EPA grants to train water technicians, support grant writing in underserved communities, and provide water to a garden at Blackburn Middle School in Jackson.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/05115716/Farish-Street-Green-Commons-6.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Photo byArielle Robinson / Verite News)Tulane University is no longer pursuing disciplinary action against seven students who were originally facing consequences for their participation in an off-campus protest advocating for Columbia student activist Mahmoud Khalil to be released from immigration detention in Louisiana.
The students announced on June 9 that the school had dismissed the charges.
The protest took place on March 11 near Tulane University and proceeded peacefully as participants called for both Tulane and Loyola universities to take action against deportation and recent actions taken by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Rory Macdonald, one of the seven students, said that initially receiving the charges was devastating.
“It was a terrible overreach on Tulane’s part,” Macdonald said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Macdonald and some other students went through a similar disciplinary process after participating in an encampment at Tulane during the spring of 2024, which resulted in a semester-long suspension.
“We tried to fight [those suspensions] too, and we weren’t successful,” Macdonald said. “But I think that what’s different here is that we had the legal support that really let us show them, this will not stand.”
After the protest, the Office of Student Conduct sent emails to the students informing them of their charges, including “failure to comply,” “disruptive conduct,” and “acting in collusion to violate the Code of Conduct.”
According to a letter written by legal counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), the students were told that their actions were not protected by the university’s freedom of expression policy because of their association with Tulane Students for a Democratic Society, a student group that was suspended from campus after organizing the spring 2024 encampment.
Cameron McLaren, one of the students who was facing charges, told Verite News in an email that she believes the university was operating politically without explicitly saying so.
“The school was trying to police our affiliation with a national organization and hid their motives by retroactively enforcing copyright/branding rules,” McLaren wrote.
FIRE, a nonprofit organization focused on protecting free speech, criticized Tulane for penalizing the students for protesting off-campus.
“Once an organization is no longer affiliated with the university, Tulane has no further interest in prohibiting students from associating with the group off campus, just as it has no interest in barring membership in any other local political organization, sports league, or theater ensemble,” the letter reads.
Zach Greenberg, a lawyer with FIRE, told Verite that the organization is involved with hundreds of cases regarding free speech on college campuses each year.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We’re glad to see that Tulane dropped the charges and did the right thing,” Greenberg said. “However, the charges should never have been brought to begin with. The universities, before they bring these charges, should understand what free speech protects and refrain from punishing students for exercising their rights.”
According to Macdonald, the process of disciplinary hearings typically involve Tulane’s legal representatives asking students questions in a format similar to that of a legal deposition.
“It’s a very one-sided process and we fought to change the process,” Macdonald said. “We eventually were able to get a meeting between the students who were under attack, faculty who were supporting them and the dean of students.”
Leading up to these meetings, the students asked members of the public to call into the dean of students’ office and express their concerns about penalizing the students. In their second meeting with administrators, the students were informed that the charges were being dismissed.
Tulane has not made a public statement about the reasoning behind the charges being dropped. Macdonald said that the students were not given any additional information regarding the decision when it was made.
Tulane spokesperson Michael Strecker said that the university cannot comment on individual conduct cases. In a written statement provided to Verite, Strecker emphasized that Tulane’s conduct process is “educational in nature.”
“There are multiple paths for resolving cases, ranging from major matter investigations to informal resolution processes,” Strecker wrote. “The path any individual student’s case takes may change along the way based on the information provided and available.”
McLaren was relieved when the charges were dropped because it meant that she could graduate this past May as planned, with a degree in psychology and computer science.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I knew that the decision wasn’t due to Tulane having a change of heart; rather, we ran a successful political defense campaign,” she wrote, referring to the letter from FIRE and calls from the public.
Macdonald, who will be returning to Tulane in the fall to finish their studies as a history major, says that they are still concerned about the state of free speech on campus.
“We won the right to keep organizing Tulane students off-campus, but a lot of us feel like we need to keep fighting until there is actually some measure of free speech on campus,” they said. “The only way we can make any progress in our universities is to be loud and public about it.”

Phil Murphy in 2025. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, is entering the general election season with a double-digit lead over her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, according to a new Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Wednesday.
The first major gubernatorial poll since the June primary shows Sherrill with 51% of voters’ support, and Ciattarelli with 31%, if the Nov. 4 election were held today.
Including voters who lean toward a candidate, her lead grows by one point. About 3% say they’d vote neither, and 6% are uncertain.
While Sherrill holds a comfortable edge, the poll also suggests economic issues could take front and center to narrow the race as November approaches. Pollsters also found “an intense national political landscape” will have an impact yet to be seen, and that this gap will likely shrink in the next several months.
“Early polling on the governor’s race should serve as a baseline or a barometer of how voters are feeling in the moment — not as some crystal ball predicting the future four months from now,” said Ashley Koning, an assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling. “A lot can happen between now and November.”
She said 2021 showed how much a race can shift in just a few months. Ciattarelli, who was also the GOP gubernatorial candidate then, narrowly lost to Gov. Phil Murphy in a closer-than-expected race. Polls had showed Murphy ahead by double digits, but he only won by about three points.
President Donald Trump remains a looming presence in the race, with 52% of voters polled saying Trump plays a “major factor” in their vote, Wednesday’s poll showed. Nearly three-quarters of Sherrill supporters cited Trump as a top concern, compared to 27% of Ciattarelli backers.
Koning noted that while Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli may have boosted him in the primaries, these numbers are “an early sign” that the endorsement could play out differently in the general election.
“Trump’s influence appears to be more of a benefit to Sherrill right now,” said Koning.
With four months to go, both campaigns are battling for the bloc of independent voters that could sway the race. Sherrill, whose name recognition and favorability has surged since April, has been seen as the more moderate candidate between the two, according to the poll.
Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, still commands strong enthusiasm from the Republican base, with about 80% of his supporters saying they are “very” or “somewhat enthusiastic.” But Sherrill outpaces him nearly 2-to-1 on health care, education and infrastructure.
She loses her edge on taxes and affordability, the two biggest issues New Jerseyans face, the poll states. On handling taxes, Sherrill leads 39% to Ciattarelli’s 34%, and on cost of living, 45% say they’d trust Sherrill more while 29% support Ciattarelli.
Voters also are split on who would handle crime and safety better — 39% support Sherrill compared to 37% backing Ciattarelli.
Ciattarelli’s team took to social media to blast the poll. Chris Russell, a political strategist for the candidate, called it “pure fantasy” and compared it to 2021 polls that they said incorrectly predicted the gubernatorial results. He also suggested the data contains inaccurate calculations and “methodological malpractice,” saying Kamala Harris and Murphy supporters were overrepresented.
An Eagleton spokesperson did not immediately respond to Russell’s comments.
Seventy-eight percent of voters said they will “definitely” cast ballots in the November election, and another 15% said “probably.”
Pollsters surveyed 621 adults, including 579 registered voters, in mid-June. The poll has a margin of error of 5.4 percentage points.

The accelerated phaseout of wind and solar energy tax credits could raise rates in Wyoming by an average 29%, according to one consumer group.
The post Big Beautiful Bill could inflate Wyoming electricity rates, some observers say appeared first on WyoFile .","Though bargaining continues, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could land on President Donald Trump’s desk later this week with major implications for Wyoming’s energy economy and, very likely, residents’ electric bills.
For better or worse? Depends on whether you believe renewable energy is a help or a hindrance to meet the exploding electrical demand. 
Wyoming’s top politicians suggest the bill, in its Senate form, is a panacea for affordable fossil-fuel and nuclear energy. It will “unleash affordable, available, reliable Wyoming energy,” Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso said this week. 
Critics, meantime, warn that renewable energy is left out of the bill’s unleashing. Instead, the sweeping budget and policy bill will deliver a punishing blow to wind and solar projects by stripping key federal tax credits and solidifying Trump administration efforts to suppress permitting and other support for the industries, likely jeopardizing hundreds of projects slated throughout the country, they say.
This graph predicting the potential impact of the Big Beautiful Bill Act on electricity prices is based on analysis by the National Electrical Reciprocal Alliance. (Clean Energy Buyers Association/screenshot) 
Estimates of what that means for U.S. ratepayers’ monthly electric bills over the next several years range from a 10% to 20% increase. 
One consumer advocacy group — Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose 400 members include Microsoft, Amazon and Google — warned that if the renewable energy sector loses the 45Y and 48E production and investment tax credits, it would raise the cost of electricity in Wyoming by an average 29% — the steepest increase in the nation.
“There is no question that removing tech-neutral energy credits would cause economic harm and job losses and drive up electricity prices in more than half the country,” the association’s CEO, Rich Powell, said in a prepared statement last month.
Reached Tuesday by WyoFile, the association said it could not provide further details regarding its Big Beautiful Bill analysis for Wyoming. You can read highlights and find links to its full report here. For now, many local utility officials are reserving comments as they review the 900-plus-page bill.

The average Wyoming household pays about $105 per month for electricity compared to the U.S. average of about $135, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Renewables’ growing role in Wyoming
For all of Wyoming’s fossil fuel might, tilting federal policy toward coal, oil and natural gas and away from renewables doesn’t cleanly translate into more affordable electricity, according to industry watchers. The U.S. fleet of coal-fired power plants, for example, is old and increasingly expensive to operate, utilities say. 
Meantime, wind and solar — albeit with the help of federal tax incentives — continually improve their cost efficiency while helping meet an insatiable demand to power artificial intelligence and other computational industries. Wind and solar are the fastest-growing sources of new electrical power in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Wind power in Wyoming has doubled since 2019, making up more than 21% of electrical generation in the state.
If that momentum goes away, it will be difficult for utilities to maintain rates and meet burgeoning new demand, said Jonathan Naughton, director of the University of Wyoming’s Wind Energy Research Center.
“If you take a look at what could be built and installed today, it’s wind, solar and [energy] storage,” Naughton told WyoFile. 
Adding more nuclear power generation takes a long time, Naughton added, and no utility is proposing to build a new coal plant. Thanks to AI and industrial competition for direct power additions, “if you try and buy a [natural] gas turbine right now, you’re looking at five to six years before you can get one.”
Naughton declined to speculate on the Big Beautiful Bill’s potential implications for Wyoming’s electric ratepayers. However, increasing competition for new power, he said, has developers scrambling to build whatever form of power generation that can be installed the fastest.
“It comes down to, ‘How can government and the administration affect these things?'” Naughton said. “The bottom line is, we need a lot of electricity generation developed over the next 10 years. And what is ready? I think wind and solar and [energy] storage are really ready to do that.”

The auditor says the Education Department failed to use $250 million that could have gone into bolstering underfunded areas of education during fiscal years 2021-24 — a conclusion the department disputes in its response to the report.
The disagreement between the department and auditor appears to revolve around their conflicting interpretations of state budget language.
The auditor’s report specifically says pupil and vocational transportation were underfunded areas that could have benefitted had the department reallocated excess funding as the state budget allows. Instead, the department returned or “lapsed” the $250 million to the state’s General Fund or Budget Reserve Trust Fund.
The money in question was allocated through the state’s basic education funding SEEK (Support Education Excellence in Kentucky) formula.
Earlier this year, Fletcher wrote that KDE was predicting a $40 million SEEK funding shortfall in the 2024-25 academic year.
The SEEK formula determines the amount of state funding to local school districts. The formula has a base per-pupil funding allocation, along with additional funding for factors like transportation costs or the number of students in a district who qualify for additional resources like special education, free or reduced-price lunch and English language assistance.
Other findings included: 

“Kentucky still has significant work to do related to closing achievement gaps and
ensuring all students are prepared for future success.”
When reviewing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, auditors “did not observe any program or activity at KDE that indicated non-compliance with current federal guidance” as of May 2025. 
KDE and the state’s other education and labor agencies “have gaps in communication, in alignment around strategic resource planning, and in goal-setting for a unified state-level vision for student success in K12, postsecondary, and career.” 

The auditor’s office conducted the examination with PCG Consulting Group on KDE’s activities between July 2020 and June 2024. The full report includes a June 2025 response to the audit from Fletcher on KDE’s behalf, saying there is “what may be perceived as a conflict of interest” with PCG. Fletcher said the consulting firm held contracts with KDE and was an active bidder on two KDE solicitations during its involvement in the examination. PCG was not awarded either contract. 
Ball said in a follow-up letter dated July 1 that KDE did not inform her office or PCG about the possible conflict of interest but instead “decided to raise this issue for the first time now,” after seeing the report. Ball also asserted that PCG and her office “worked side-by-side to critically analyze KDE, without reservation.” 
PCG also included a reply to KDE’s claim saying it conducts a “conflict check” before responding to any request for proposals or other opportunities, and that it has other state-level clients in Kentucky.

In a statement about the audit as a whole, Fletcher said it “took many, many hours of staff time to speak with the auditors and provide the documents that were required for this deep look at how the agency operates.” 
“In every section, the report highlights the good work agency staff have been doing to support the students and educators of Kentucky,” Fletcher said. “The audit showed that morale at KDE is high, our staff members truly believe in the agency’s work and that superintendents believe they can rely on KDE to provide them with high-quality resources.
“KDE is an organization focused on continuous improvement. We look forward to utilizing the APA’s final report to identify opportunities for future growth and plans for continued improvement in service of Kentucky’s public school students. We welcome the opportunity to work with the Kentucky General Assembly for the legislative changes necessary to accomplish recommendations within the report.” 
Though they acknowledged they are still reviewing the audit’s findings, Republican House Speaker David Osborne and Rep. Scott Lewis, the chair of the House Primary and Secondary Education committee, said in a Tuesday press release that “it is abundantly clear that it provides an invaluable road map for improvements.” 
“The Department of Education holds arguably the most important mission in state government: preparing the next generation of Kentuckians for success. Yet, far too many students fall short of their academic potential because of failed programs, broken systems, and antiquated processes that no longer serve today’s needs,” the statement said. “Education continues to be a priority for the legislature. We’ve provided historic levels of funding — even after adjusting for inflation — and adopted policies to improve curriculum, behavioral issues, and attract talented educators.” 
The Republican lawmakers added that legislators “must consider recommendations and implement the changes necessary to create real, measurable improvement” and they look forward to working with KDE, educators and administrators “to address the concerns identified in this audit and to build a stronger, more accountable educational system for all Kentucky students.”
The Kentucky General Assembly will convene in Frankfort for the 2026 legislative session in January. One of the top legislative priorities will include deciding the next two-year state budget. 
The Republican Party of Kentucky issued a statement criticizing KDE for the “improperly returned” $250 million in SEEK funding, particularly amid the predicted shortfall earlier this year. 
“Until Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Department of Education can properly manage the funding already available for local school districts, they have no business requesting more money or using taxpayer-funded public relations stunts to pressure the General Assembly into launching new education programs — especially when Auditor Ball’s report clearly shows this administration is incapable of managing the ones already in place,” said RPK spokesperson Andy Westberry.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/231107Gubernatorial_Night11_MM-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Jetta Productions Inc./Getty Images)Indiana scored a $6.25 million boost from the federal government to expand registered apprenticeships across the state – growing a path to high paying, in-demand careers for Hoosiers. 
The Indiana Department of Workforce Development Work-Based Learning and Apprenticeship team secured the federal grant as part of a nearly $84 million national push by the U.S. Department of Labor to expand apprenticeship capacity. 
“These federal dollars ensure Indiana is in a prime position to deliver on President Trump’s Executive Order to modernize American workforce programs,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a press release. “We’re not just equipping employers with vital tools for skills development; we’re cementing Indiana’s leadership in workforce innovation and economic prosperity.”
The award includes: 

$1.28 million in base funding to bolster existing apprenticeship infrastructure.
$4,9 million in competitive expansion grants aimed at launching new apprenticeship models and reducing barriers for employers.

The RAP combines on-the-job learning, classroom instruction and mentorship to train individuals in their field. The program is offered in in several industries including agriculture, building and construction and health and life sciences. DWD Commissioner Josh Richardson said RAP is a pathway to good paying careers. 
“The resources allotted allows us to deepen partnerships with Indiana businesses, community colleges, and training providers – strengthening our talent pipeline and ensuring Hoosiers have the skills employers need today and into the future,” he said in a press release. 
For fiscal year 2025, there were a total of 25,250 active apprentices across the state – putting Indiana near the lead. 
Indiana’s demand for apprenticeship is rising after education officials approved a massive high school diploma redesign last year. The new graduation plan includes more personalized learning pathways and experiences, including taking college courses while in high school and gaining hands-on experience.

The $26 million in federal grant funding supported after-school and summer programs, professional development for teachers and staff, as well as English language instruction for students.

The Trump administration announced this week it was withholding $26 million in federal grant funding to Vermont’s public schools, part of a broader freeze of more than $6 billion nationwide for after-school and summer programs and English language instruction.
Funds for these programs were supposed to be distributed on July 1. But the U.S. Department of Education alerted the state Agency of Education they were holding the funds back “on the evening of June 30,” according to a press release by the Agency of Education.
The federal department told state education officials they will conduct a review of the programs, but did not provide a timeline for when that would be completed, according to the agency’s press release.
The abrupt pause in funding will likely disrupt local school districts’ operations. Those federal funds are built into local districts’ budgets for the 2025-26 school year, according to the release.
Vermont Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders said in the release the decision to withhold these funds, “disrupts districts’ ability to staff critical positions and provide a wide range of programming, including efforts to reduce chronic absenteeism and improve literacy outcomes.”
“This decision also contributes to a culture of uncertainty that takes away from the important work our schools need to focus on to support our students,” Saunders said.
Six federal grant programs were affected by the funding pause, according to the Agency of Education, including programs to provide instructional and support services to migrant children and their families.
The funds supported the University of Vermont-run Vermont Migrant Education Program that serves children who have relocated alone or with their families to obtain seasonal or temporary employment in agriculture, the Agency of Education release said.
Another program has supported instructional services and supports within school districts for English language learners. Those grant dollars were used to fund multilingual liaisons to help families integrate into their schools and communities through summer school and after-school English language services.
Other federally funded programs helped finance mentoring programs and professional development for teachers. The state agency said in its release the programs were “essential to improving academic outcomes as well as supporting the retention of effective educators.”
Another program supported programming for mental health services, which the state agency said was critical to reducing chronic absenteeism.
The Agency of Education said it was “actively working with districts to mitigate the impact of this decision by conducting outreach and providing one-on-one intensive support to the field.”
“The Agency is proud of the critical investments that Vermont public schools have made using these federal funds and will continue to support districts in navigating the uncertainty in the federal funding landscape,” the agency said in its release.

A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with […]","Guns on display in February 2023 at Caso’s Gun-A-Rama in Jersey City, New Jersey. (Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Gun-industry companies and groups give $2 million to help build state-owned shooting range

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

But people are far more likely to win their cases — and not get deported — with one.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Renata Daou to discuss her article, “A lack of immigration lawyers in CT means big court backlogs,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Renata’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Renata. You say a shortage of judges and immigration court staff has been an issue during the Biden administration, but it hasn’t been discussed much since President Trump ramped up his mass deportation policy. So what prompted you to do this analysis, and what do the numbers show?
RD: So it wasn’t much of a matter who the president was when I started doing the analysis. It was last year that I went to a self-representation clinic that groups were hosting in Hartford, in a church. So I just went, kind of like, to see what it was about. And when I was there, I was talking to the people who were hosting the clinic and the lawyers that were there, and I was like, ‘Oh, why are you doing this? How many people are usually coming?’ And I was just chatting with them. And, one thing that they told me that caught my attention was that they were doing this because a lot of these people who are coming to the clinics wanted to be represented by lawyers, but they couldn’t find anyone available, or they didn’t have the money to afford a lawyer. But this clinic is free, so that was an option for them.
And one of the lawyers that I was talking to was quite frustrated, because she was like, there are too many people. Like, I cannot handle more cases than I already have. There are way more people than like, and all of us can. Even if we try to take as many people as we can, it’s just impossible. So I was wondering if that is a problem across Connecticut? Is this a Hartford problem? I remembered that last year, the problem seemed to be a bit worse. I remember that Connecticut was like, maybe, like 12, in the ranking of not being represented. So it was actually worse last year than it is this year. So I remember that I looked at that and I was like, wow, that wasn’t like something that I really expected for Connecticut. I didn’t know that there was, like the shortage. So I just started talking to a bunch of different lawyers about their experience. Looked at the data like and that’s how it came to be.
WSHU: It’s interesting that the backlog has actually gone down from 46,000 in 2024 to 42,364. Is that from 2023 to 2024, or is this the 2025 number?
RD: I believe those are like pending cases.
WSHU: Pending cases, yes, it’s going down. The number of pending cases is going down.
RD: Yeah. It kind of spiked in 2023 and 2024, and now it’s decreasing a little bit.
WSHU: Now, why is that happening? Do you have any ideas?
RD: So I talked to a few of the lawyers about why they thought this was happening. But the maximum that I can say is just like anecdotal evidence, there isn’t really a set answer as to why it was going down from 2024 to 2025 when I talked to them. I know that some of them are like, maybe, like student clinics. They’re representing these people, and they’re trying to take on more and more people. It’s just like people rushing; the process is just like trying to get it done faster. But no one really knows.
WSHU: You visited the immigration court in Hartford. What was your experience? What was the process like?
RD: I went to a merits hearing. For most people, it was either the first or second hearing. So basically, what happened was that the judge was asking, like, ‘Oh, have you filed for asylum?’ Most people had already filled out the application. So he would ask, like, ‘Do you have a lawyer?’ Most people didn’t. So he was just setting another court date. But of course, he couldn’t be sitting forever. So like, for most of them, they’re like, Okay, next time they come, we third our lawyer, we’re gonna go through with the process. So it wasn’t when they actually presented all the evidence. It was just like those initial hearings.
WSHU: How difficult is it for someone in immigration court to represent themselves without a lawyer? What difference does having a lawyer make in an immigration case?
RD: Your success rate if you have a lawyer is way higher than if you don’t have a lawyer. I believe it’s just like the knowledge of the law, because, like, a lot of people don’t know, like, what documents they need to fill, what programs they are eligible for, because there’s a lot of different visas that you can apply in the US. There are a lot of different programs that you can qualify for, depending on your situation. And if you have just arrived in a new country, some people speak English. Some people don’t. If you just like, arriving and you don’t really know where to start, what you’re eligible for, it’s kind of like, hard to create a case and to have all this documentation ready and prepared, if you’re doing all this by yourself, and you don’t even know what the process looks like, if you’re like, going completely like blank, I don’t know. You think, like, realistically, like, what are the chances that you’re actually going to be able to, like, defend yourself against, for example, like the government lawyer who knows the house, and those are the programs, and knows everything.
WSHU: You’re not on the same level as them.
RD: Yeah, and having a lawyer who knows all these processes and everything you’re eligible for makes a huge difference.
WSHU: What’s the situation? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? What’s your takeaway from doing this analysis?
RD: It’s kind of difficult to say if it’s getting better or not. I think the backlog might be coming down.
WSHU: Could that be because there are fewer people who are going through immigration court these days, because a lot of people are self-deporting?
RD: I don’t know how many people are self-deporting. I would say that I think it’s just, like, going down, just because, like I said, a lot of people cannot find lawyers. So, the cases get resolved quickly.
WSHU: You spoke to some lawyers. How do they feel about the future of immigration courts, for people who have to go through immigration court? I have Melissa here who says, “The biggest thing I wish people knew is just how wonderful my clients are, just how wonderful the immigration immigrant communities in our state and throughout the country are.” So they feel that if people got to know the immigrants, they would be less supportive of the harsh way that immigrants are being treated right now.
RD: Yeah, I was going to say that, like when it comes to the lawyers, all of them are very passionate about what they do, because this is a type of law that the like, financial return, for example, if you compare to corporate stuff litigation, you make way less money and the stress. So from what I saw, like the people who are in this type of work, they actually really passionate about getting their clients to get a better life and all of that, so that you can tell that these people are in this type of job, because especially those who are doing a lot of pro bono work.
Yes, I’m not sure how much they’re making, but the people cannot pay for the services. Like an immigration lawyer, if you’re paying out of pocket, it might cost $20,000; most people cannot afford that. So they’re very passionate about it, and they want their clients to succeed. But I also like the laws keep changing really fast, so it’s kind of, okay, how are we going to keep up with this? How many people can we truly represent and not leave them hanging? So there’s this balance.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/npr.brightspotcdn-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

In a letter add[...]","Screenshot of Key West Police Chief Sean Brandenburg speaking to City Commission on June 30, 2025.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier says the Key West City Commission violated Florida law by voiding its police department’s 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) earlier this week.
Uthmeier says they need to reverse that vote, or face the possibility that Gov. Ron DeSantis will remove commissioners from office.
In a letter addressed to the seven members of the Key West City Commission, Uthmeier says that by declaring the Key West Police Department’s existing 287(g) agreement void, “Key West has made itself a sanctuary city.”
Sanctuary cities have been banned in Florida since 2019.
“Prohibiting its police officers from receiving the necessary federal training to adequately enforce U.S. immigration laws not only prevents city police from enforcing current federal immigration law but also effectively prevents the city police department from participating in federal immigration operations,” Uthmeier writes.
“In this instance, however, it’s even worse. The Commission didn’t merely prevent the Police Department from entering a 287(g) agreement; it affirmatively voided an existing 287(g) agreement under which the Police Department was actively operating. Bad policy, and illegal.”
The Key West City Commission voted 6-1 on Monday night to void the agreement, put in place by the city’s chief of police, Sean Brandenburg, on March 4, with City Manager Brian Barroso’s knowledge but not the approval of city commissioners.
Several commissioners said on Monday night that they only learned of the agreement recently, calling the decision by the city manager to give approval “improper.”
Brandenburg told the City Commission on Monday night that he began receiving emails about the 287(g) agreements from the Florida Police Chiefs Association earlier this year. He said he also received phone calls from members of the Florida Sheriffs Association telling him that signing the agreement was mandatory “and that I should start moving forward.”
“Shortly thereafter, I was advised that the governor had laid out exactly how he could now remove a police chief from office if we did not enter into a 287(g) agreement,” he said. “This obviously made the situation more urgent for me. I found the most up-to-date version and brought it to [the] legal [department] for approval.”
The resolution approved by the Key West City Commission requests that Barrosso and Brandenburg “refrain” from entering into any new agreements until the courts have ruled on the obligations imposed on local governments. And it affirms that the Key West Police Department must assist federal immigration activities “when requested.”
As of July 1, ICE has signed 744 memorandums of agreement with local law enforcement agencies for 287(g) programs covering 40 states, including more than 280 with counties or cities in Florida, according to ICE’s website. That includes every sheriff’s office in the state.
This is not the first time that Uthmeier has threatened local elected officials. In March, Uthmeier warned three members of the Fort Myers city council that the governor could remove them from office if they didn’t allow the city police to question people about their immigration status and detain those subject to deportation.
“The City Commission must immediately reverse its June 30, 2025, action and allow the Police Department to resume cooperative engagement with ICE under its 287(g) agreement,” Uthmeier writes. “Failure to take corrective action will result in the enforcement of all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal from office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution.”

“Any seam that had an issue where there was water leakage has already been fixed overnight,” DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, told reporters following a press conference Wednesday.
The governor’s spokesperson also said the Florida Division of Emergency Management is in charge of the site at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport with federal oversight from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman wrote in a statement that vendors had tightened any seams at the base of the structures that allowed water to come in during the storm. She described the water intrusion as minimal.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.

In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Performance indicators released Friday show Louisiana’s economy shrank by 1.7% over the first few months of 2025 and is moving in what one expert called a “sideways” direction marked by sluggish growth and contractions at both the state and national levels. However, it’s not yet in recession territory, analysts say. 
New first-quarter data that became available last week showed the U.S. economy slowed further than analysts had initially thought. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of the goods and services produced, shrunk for the first time since 2022 and Louisiana posted the worst GDP rate in the Southeast region.
With a shrinkage of -1.7% GDP for the first quarter, Louisiana dropped in the state rankings from 15th to 38th, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce report released Friday. The sectors performing the worst included minerals extraction (mining, quarrying and oil and gas drilling), construction and finance and insurance. 
Louisiana economist Loren Scott said there is broad consensus that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are a big cause of the economic contraction. 
Trump’s tariff threats prompted American businesses to stock up on products, causing a surge of foreign imports into the U.S. that far exceeded the production of American-made goods and services, Scott said. 
Still, Scott is expecting GDP growth to improve for the second quarter at both the national and state levels. Those figures are set to be released at the end of July.  
  Real gross domestic product decreased in 39 states in the first quarter of 2025, with the percent change ranging from 1.7% at an annual rate in South Carolina to –6.1 percent in Iowa and Nebraska, according to statistics released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)
“The second quarter is gonna be totally reversed,” he said, though he hedged his forecast with a caveat. “If the tariffs stay in place, you’re going to see the economy slow down and inflation creep back up.”
David Dismukes, an economist with Acadian Consulting Group in Baton Rouge, was less optimistic, pointing to signs of inflation already increasing and a tight labor market. He expects both indicators to remain problematic for the remainder of the year with Louisiana continuing to mirror the U.S. economy.  
“We’ve been moving pretty much sideways,” Dismukes said. “I don’t think the economy is very strong … though we haven’t quite entered recession territory.” 
A U.S. Department of Commerce report released Thursday indicated that inflation ticked up in May. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Federal Reserve’s inflation reading to track the prices of goods and services, has risen 3.7% from December, bringing the average annual inflation rate to 2.4% nationally and 2% for Louisiana and the southern region. 
The main inflation culprit continued to be food and grocery prices. The cost of food, overall, in Louisiana has increased 2.8% since May of last year. That includes a 3.6% hike on food from restaurants and a 2.2% hike on groceries over the same period, according to the Consumer Price Index.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy to more accurately measure long-term trends, posted a 0.2% spike in May, increasing the state’s annual core inflation by 2.5% since last year.
Rising prices for goods and services often leads to wage growth. Wages on average began outpacing inflation over a year ago and continue to do so, though they have held steady at 4.3% since February, according to a Fed wage growth tracker. 
There are other signs of uncertainty on the horizon. After several months of gains, the average personal income of Americans fell 0.4% in May. And more significantly, consumer spending fell to unexpected levels, according to a Commerce Department report released Friday.  
The downturn in consumer spending is what pulled down the GDP, signaling there was more uncertainty in the economy than most had thought, Scott said. 
“The business sector doesn’t like uncertainty,” Scott said. “Uncertainty is the bane of economic growth.”
Until now, spending had remained strong throughout the high inflation period that began three years ago. Following steady gains through last December, analysts had estimated slower growth of just 1.8% for the first quarter of 2025, but they missed that mark by more than a percentage point as the latest consumer spending data showed just 0.5% growth. That disparity is what caused the Federal Reserve to revise its first-quarter economic report.   
One bright spot has been the labor market. Louisiana’s jobs market finally recovered from the hemorrhaging that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic five years ago. After lagging behind the rest of the country, the state reached its pre-pandemic mark in February with nearly 2 million non-farm jobs, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That number has been inching upward, though it remains to be seen if the trend will continue or level off.
Scott said he believes Louisiana can continue to post job gains. He cited a string of recent announcements from large companies moving into the state such as Meta’s planned data center and Hyundai’s steel plant. 
Sharing a different take, Dismukes said he doesn’t see much more room for job gains unless Louisiana can grow its population. 
Complicating the labor market is a series of high-profile raids by U.S. immigration officials targeting sectors that generally employ migrant workers. One of those is the construction sector.
Dan Mills, CEO of the Home Builders Association of Greater New Orleans, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have “absolutely” affected his industry. 
“I continue to hear more stories about empty job sites and builders having trouble finding people,” Mills said. 
Even documented legal immigrants are not showing up for work because they’re afraid of getting swept up in the raids and accused of having fake documents, he said. 
“The fear that is created by these officials showing up in unmarked cars and masks, they don’t know if they’re being illegally detained or kidnapped,” Mills said. 
He said the ICE raids are exacerbating what was already a tight labor market with not enough workers in the residential home building sector. 
“We’ve seen labor prices increase 38% over the last four years, and we have 350,000 job vacancies in residential contracting nationwide,” Mills said. “Any exacerbation of that is only gonna push that number up.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)As the U.S. House of Representatives debates whether to give final passage to Congressional Republicans’ signature tax break and spending cuts package, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer released an analysis Wednesday that indicates implementation of the proposed Medicaid and food assistance cuts could cost Michigan billions in lost revenue.
 “Republican cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will rip healthcare away from our most vulnerable friends and family and create a ripple effect that cuts jobs and drives up costs for middle class Americans,” Whitmer said in a press release. 
The analysis highlighted three reports, the first from the Washington Center for Economic Growth. Compiled by Professor Robert Manduca of the University of Michigan, the report indicates Medicaid amounts to an average of 11.2% of the economic base of regions nationwide. According to Manduca that means Medicaid contributes roughly as much to metropolitan Detroit as the auto industry. 
Additionally, the report says many recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would no longer be able to afford their groceries, resulting in grocery stores losing revenue and impacting their ability to pay their employees, as well as buy food from suppliers, ultimately impacting farmers and other food manufacturers.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Another report cited by Whitmer, this one from the Commonwealth Fund, estimates that if the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP proposed in the GOP budget bill are allowed to take effect, Michigan’s gross domestic product would drop by $3.57 billion by 2029. A third report from the Michigan Health and Hospital Association found that the hospital industry in the state could see up to 17,300 jobs in health care cut, with more than 16,000 others indirectly tied to the industry also slashed.
“The cuts to Medicaid included in this bill will result in the loss of healthcare access throughout all of Michigan,” Brian Peters, CEO of Michigan Health & Hospital Association, said in the news release. “Healthcare providers will be forced to reduce services, impacting all Michiganders and harming the health and wellness of our communities.” 
The legislation, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump, would extend the 2017 tax cuts for wealthier Americans passed during his first term, which would be offset by vastly scaling back spending from the federal government.
Whitmer, in the press release, said that Republican cuts to Medicaid, combined with the loss of $2.95 billion in direct federal funding, Michigan faces a total loss of more than $4.5 billion in gross domestic product as well as 41,500 total jobs. The job losses alone, she said, means Michigan would lose out on $319 million in state and local tax revenue. 
“With fewer people able to afford groceries or pay their hospital bill, local communities will lose spending, business, and jobs. Raising costs for working families to pay for a tax cut for the rich is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I’ll keep working with anyone to lower costs, create jobs, and protect access to affordable, quality health care.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMR_1282-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Twenty-two businesses and nonprofits across Delaware have been awarded grants through the Delaware Grocery Initiative, part of the state’s effort to fight food insecurity and expand access to nutritious food in underserved communities.
The initiative, also known as the First State Food System Grants, is run by the Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) and aims to support food access in areas classified as food deserts or at risk of becoming so.
Grants ranging from $5,000 to $12,500 were awarded, with a total of $25,000 distributed in this round of funding.

The money will help recipients improve supply chains, expand cold storage, and strengthen partnerships among community-based food providers.
“The Delaware Grocery Initiative is about bolstering economic development and uplifting some of our most vulnerable communities,” said State Senator Darius Brown, who sponsored the legislation that created the program. “Access to nutritious food is essential for living a long and healthy life. This program ensures that critical component of personal health is a reality for all Delawareans, regardless of their tax bracket or the neighborhood they live in.”
More than 50 applications were submitted for this round of funding. DSB officials said they prioritized projects that focused on infrastructure improvements such as food aggregation, transportation, and storage—key elements in strengthening Delaware’s local food system.
Among the 22 grant recipients are organizations like Native Roots Farm Foundation, Lutheran Community Services, The HOPP, Jefferson Street Center, and YWCA Delaware.
The list also includes small businesses like Woodenhawk Farms Inc., Forever Freeze Co., and Farmacy Market.
All projects supported by this grant must be completed by December 31, 2025.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)In a 4-3 decision, Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state’s 1849 law banning abortion had been “impliedly repealed” by the Legislature when it passed laws over the past half century “regulating in detail the ‘who, what, where, when, and how’” of abortion. 
The Court’s majority opinion, authored by Justice Rebecca Dallet and joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, finds that the Legislature could not have passed laws regulating abortion access if the 1849 statute was believed to remain in effect. 
“This case is about giving effect to 50 years’ worth of laws passed by the Legislature about virtually every aspect of abortion including where, when, and how health-care providers may lawfully perform abortions,” Dallet wrote. “The Legislature, as the peoples’ representatives, remains free to change the laws with respect to abortion in the future. But the only way to give effect to what the Legislature has actually done over the last 50 years is to conclude that it impliedly repealed the 19th century near-total ban on abortion, and that [the statute] therefore does not prohibit abortion in the State of Wisconsin.” 
Dallet wrote that when the Legislature passed laws restricting abortion under narrower circumstances, guiding “where, when and how” health care providers could perform an abortion and outlining how public money could fund abortion providers, it was repealing the 1849 law. 
The ruling comes three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark Court ruling that found there was a constitutional right to abortion access and marks the conclusion of a legal dispute that helped Protasiewicz win election to the Court in 2023 and Susan Crawford win election this April. 
In response, the Court’s three conservative justices filed dissents, accusing the majority of “propaganda,” “smoke-and-mirrors legalese” and “pure policymaking.” 
“The majority’s smoke-and-mirrors legalese is nothing more than ‘painting a mule to resemble a zebra, and then going zebra hunting. But paint does not change the mule into a zebra,’” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Those in the majority know better, but they do so anyway because they like the result and promised to deliver it.” 
In his dissent, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that the majority failed to show when the law was presumably repealed by the Legislature, saying that the opinion doesn’t properly address the Legislature’s actions in 2011 and 2015 amending the 1849 law.  
“The majority does not say when over those 40 years the Legislature once and for all repealed [the statute],” he wrote. “Was it when the Legislature passed a postviability ban? A partial-birth abortion ban? A twenty-week ban? A waiting period? A physician licensing requirement? The majority fails to say.”
23AP2362 Mandate
Following the ruling’s release, the state’s Democratic elected officials and abortion access activists celebrated the decision as a “win” for reproductive health care in the state. 
“Thanks to our lawsuit, today’s decision affirms that access to reproductive healthcare will continue to be available, helping ensure Wisconsin women today are not forced to face firsthand what it’s like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today is a win for women and families, a win for healthcare professionals who want to provide medically accurate care to their patients, and a win for basic freedoms in Wisconsin, but our work is not over. I will continue to fight any effort that takes away Wisconsinites’ reproductive freedom or makes reproductive healthcare, whether birth control, abortion, IVF, or fertility treatments, any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. That is a promise.”
Wisconsin’s state and federal Democratic lawmakers responded to the ruling by saying it wasn’t enough, promising to continue working to codify abortion access in law. 
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she will continue to work to enact her proposal to ensure women across the country have access to abortion care. 
“Today’s ruling tells women across Wisconsin that we will not go back,” Baldwin said. “Today’s ruling tells women that our government trusts you to make decisions about your own body and your future. Today’s ruling tells women in our state that they are not second-class citizens. But, this fight is not over. Every woman, in every zip code, in every state deserves the same rights and freedoms. I will not stop fighting until we make that a reality and pass my bill to restore the right to abortion nationwide and allow women to make their own health care decisions without interference from judges or politicians.”
State Sen. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said the Legislature must now pass a bill guaranteeing the right to an abortion. 
“Now that the courts have made it clear that Wisconsin does not have a total abortion ban, we must go further,” Subeck said. “It’s time to protect reproductive rights not just in practice, but in law. We must pass the Abortion Rights Restoration Act to guarantee the right to abortion and eliminate the medically unjustified, politically motivated restrictions that still exist in our state statutes. The people of Wisconsin deserve nothing less than full access to safe and legal reproductive health care without unnecessary barriers and free from judgement.”
In a concurring opinion, Karofsky wrote that interpreting the 1849 law as banning abortion gives the state the authority to “exert total control” over women and “strips women and pregnant people of the dignity and authority to make intimate and personal choices by exposing medical professionals who perform abortions to 15-year prison terms.” 
In her opinion, Karofsky details the history of abortion access in the U.S. and highlights four women who died because of restrictive abortion bans, including the recent deaths of two Black women in Georgia and a Honduran immigrant in Texas as well as the death of her own great-grandmother in Boston in 1929. 
“I tell the stories of Amber, Candi, Josseli, and my great-grandmother Julia to remind us that severe abortion restrictions operate like death warrants,” Karofsky wrote. “Under such restrictions women, children, and pregnant people are denied life-saving medical care while medical professionals are forced to sit idly at their bedsides, unable to do their jobs. Extreme abortion restrictions revive a time in our history driven by misogyny and racism, divorced from medical science; it is a world that must be left behind.” 
In her dissent, Justice Rebecca Bradley accused Karofsky of rewriting history to achieve a desired outcome in the case. 
“Not content with effacing the law, Chief Justice Jill Karofsky rewrites history, erases and insults women by referring to mothers as ‘pregnant people,’ slanders proponents of the pro-life perspective, and broadcasts dangerously false narratives about laws restricting abortion,” Bradley wrote. “Laden with emotion, steeped in myth, and light on the law, the concurrence reads as a parody of progressive politics rather than the opinion of a jurist.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_8328-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.
It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.
In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.
In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.
By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.
But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.
These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.
At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.
Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”
“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”
In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.



“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.
That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)
Scientists and advocates also said it’s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.
“I don’t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don’t understand it.”
 Delays, confusion over PFAS
Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”
The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA’s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.
Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump’s first term. Zeldin’s EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.
The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.
Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.
The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”
The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.
When Biden’s EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.
Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.
When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.
In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don’t benefit public health.”
The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.
“It’s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.
Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.
A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)
Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”
PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.
Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they’re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they’re angry.
“I feel like we’re walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”
“It’s one thing to say you’re going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It’s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”
  A letter dated April 29, 2025, notifying Michigan State University about the termination of a grant for research into PFAS, one day after the EPA said in a press release that it was committed to combating PFAS contamination by, in part, “strengthening the science.” (Obtained by ProPublica)
 Research under fire
The EPA of Trump’s first term didn’t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.
In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina’s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”
Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.
At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.
Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year’s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.
In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The contrast between the agency’s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State’s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.
“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we’re doing is we’re undermining our ability to translate the science that we’re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”
At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.
About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”
Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”
Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don’t know how much longer we will be operating as is.”
The EPA told ProPublica that it’s “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump’s first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.
The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.
“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”
The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA’s workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.
“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency’s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3m-nocrop-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

During the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, President Calvin Coolidge also did.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

On the evening of April 5, my phone and our community’s emergency siren both started screaming at once, jarring my husband and me to our feet. I clicked my phone and heard an automated voice begin to speak, warning of a tornado near Oxford. 
My husband, emergency bag in hand, called for the dogs to follow as we hurried down the stairs to our “safe place,” a windowless storage room in the basement. Even there, we could see angry bursts of lightning and hear the siren as it continued to wail. 
My family — as do others across the state — knows how to respond to the severe storms and dangerous tornados that interrupt our lives, often with devastating results. 
In the past, the federal government, through FEMA, has also responded. But now the Federal Emergency Management Agency is threatened by an administration that wants to overhaul it. President Trump has said he wants to “fix a terribly broken system” by shifting emergency disaster response to the backs of the states. 
Together with Congress, we need to insist, as we’ve repeatedly done in the past, that the executive branch work alongside us when disaster strikes our communities. 
*
The Trump administration is not the first to downplay its role in providing emergency relief to Americans during disasters. President Calvin Coolidge took a similar stance during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. 
That year, months of persistent rain combined with runoff from melting snow pushed levees that had been engineered to constrain the Mississippi River beyond their limits. Beginning in mid-April, levees from Illinois to Louisiana began to crumble, and as they did, waves of turbulent water flooded fields and swept through towns.

While numbers hint at the destruction –hundreds of souls lost, hundreds of thousands of people displaced and thousands of square miles flooded — they don’t reflect the agony or suffering of those whose lives were capsized during the flood.
*
In late April of 1927, President Coolidge created a commission, headed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, to respond to the massive flooding that had by then spread across at least seven states. Unwilling to allocate any federal money to the effort, Coolidge instead called on the American public to donate $5 million. 
Hoover, an engineer by training, leveraged the public’s donations with the capacity of the American National Red Cross. Their volunteers provided food, clothing, medical care and temporary housing to those whose homes were destroyed. 
Meanwhile, the president stood steadfast, refusing to use federal tax dollars to provide relief. 
Or rebuild bridges or roads that had been swept away. 
Or invest in future flood-control efforts.
Newspapers up and down the Mississippi River Valley criticized President Coolidge’s insistence that the states absorb the cost of rebuilding their communities while also bracing for seasonal floods that would occur again. 
“It seems obvious,” wrote the Memphis Commercial Appeal, “that neither the head of the nation or any one of his responsible advisors realizes either the nature or the immensity of the problem.” 
The paper went on to question how a nation as wealthy as the United States could impose the “burden of tremendous loss, sacrifices, agonies and destruction,” on individual states. 
In Jackson, the Clarion-Ledger also questioned the government’s response, particularly since President Coolidge had repeatedly refused to witness the flooding in person. “Not a dime has the government appropriated. The truth of the matter is that it has been necessary to school President Coolidge day by day a bit more towards the realization of the immensity of the catastrophe.”
The public and Congress continued to demand that the federal government assume a new responsibility for its citizens, one that included disaster relief, recovery and prevention. 
Eventually, Coolidge struck a deal with Congress and in May 1928, Congress enacted the 1928 Flood Control Act. The law authorized the Corps of Engineers to design and construct projects that would control flooding on the Mississippi River and the Sacramento River in California. 
The new law also ended the philosophy that regional disasters were solely the responsibility of the states. Instead, it acknowledged that the wealth of the country would be used to alleviate the suffering of its citizens. 
In 1950, the Federal Disaster Relief Act created the pathway for states to ask the president for federal help during crises.  This was followed by the establishment of FEMA in 1979.
*
So far this year, more than 60 people have lost their lives due to tornados in the United States, including at least seven people in Mississippi. Though storms have uprooted trees, flooded streets and caused property damage in Oxford, our community has largely been spared the heartache these deadly tornadoes caused elsewhere. 
We don’t know what the future holds for FEMA. In April, President Trump appointed former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant to a council charged with recommending changes that may overhaul the agency. 
But as tornado season rolls into hurricane season, we know that the destruction caused by these severe storms is more than any of us can bear alone. We must insist that the federal government keep its sleeves rolled up and support our communities during times of disaster.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Progressive groups are rallying around New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin after legislators moved last month to take the state police from his control.
Advocates from eight grassroots groups Wednesday denounced bipartisan legislation that would make the New Jersey State Police — now a division under the state department of law and public safety, which Platkin heads — its own department answerable directly to the governor.
They criticized the bill’s timing, coming as “federal law enforcement and judicial practices have become politically weaponized under an increasingly authoritarian Trump administration.”
“This misguided legislative effort could not come at a worse time, as we can no longer expect the U.S. Department of Justice to serve as a backstop to hold state police accountable for discriminatory conduct,” said Jim Sullivan, interim policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “New Jerseyans – and all people who enter our state – deserve better.”
Antoinette Miles, who heads the New Jersey Working Families Party, urged legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Murphy to reject the bill.
“At a time when our civil rights are under attack from Donald Trump and extreme Republicans in Washington, we need our elected officials in Trenton to be working with General Platkin more closely than ever to ensure that New Jerseyans’ rights are protected,” Miles said. “This dangerous bill, the apparent product of a political vendetta, threatens to erode the progress we have made.”
Other groups blasting the bill Wednesday included New Jersey Citizen Action, Make the Road NJ, New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, New Jersey Policy Perspective and the Latino Action Network.
Tensions have increasingly grown between the state police — the largest police force statewide with 3,000 members — and Platkin, whose office investigates fatal police encounters, oversees police licensing, and publicly reports on police major discipline and use of force.  The office issued two scathing reports last fall on racism in the agency’s hiring and promotions, which renewed civil rights leaders’ calls for a clean sweep of its top brass.
Such investigations are why Platkin should retain oversight, said the Rev. Charles Boyer, founder of Salvation and Social Justice.
“The New Jersey State Police has a long, well-documented history of racism embedded in their culture,” Boyer said. “To allow them to separate from the oversight of the Attorney General’s office is not just irresponsible — it’s an assault on the Black community. Their record with Black people is abominable, and if the legislature permits this, it will echo the same disregard for justice we see under the Trump administration.”
Spokespeople for the state police and Platkin’s office didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Lawmakers pushing the bill have cited the attorney general’s lack of law enforcement experience, interference with the ability of police do their jobs and tedious bureaucracy in the attorney general’s office, among other concerns.
The legislation does have some tentative initial support from the NAACP New Jersey State Conference.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Harmful “forever chemicals” flow from wastewater treatment plants into surface water across the U.S., according to a new report by a clean-water advocacy group.
Weekslong sampling by the Waterkeeper Alliance both upstream and downstream of 22 wastewater treatment facilities in 19 states saw total per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations increase in 95 percent of tested waterways after receiving discharge from the facilities. Some of the waterways supply drinking water to nearby communities.
The study also found increased PFAS levels downstream of 80 percent of waterway-adjacent fields treated with “biosolids,” solid matter recovered from the sewage treatment process and spread on farmland as fertilizer.
Research on PFAS has linked the chemicals to multiple types of cancer, liver and kidney damage, reduced fertility, lower birth weights and endocrine system interference. Now, scientists suspect the chemicals can also impair immune system function, said toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program, who was not involved in the new report.
The study is the second phase of Waterkeeper Alliance’s National PFAS Monitoring Initiative. Phase 1, conducted in 2022, revealed PFAS contamination in 83 percent of tested U.S. rivers, lakes and streams. That number rose to 98 percent of the sites included in the most recent study.
“PFAS pose one of the most urgent environmental and public health threats of our time,” Waterkeeper Alliance CEO Marc Yaggi said at a press briefing after the report’s release last week. PFAS from industrial sources flow through wastewater treatment plants and into waterways of ecological, cultural, recreational and public health significance, he said.
“These wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove PFAS, and they face significant challenges managing this pollution, while accountability from industrial source polluters remains limited or nonexistent,” said Yaggi.

PFAS are a class of more than 9,000 man-made compounds designed to resist water, grease, heat and oil. Found in a wide range of consumer products, from clothing and nonstick cookware to cosmetics and fire retardant foam, PFAS are also released as industrial waste by the facilities that manufacture these goods.
Once in the environment, they do not break down, instead accumulating in water, soil and air. That’s how they got their unnerving “forever chemicals” name.
“It really doesn’t matter how you’re exposed to PFAS, whether you eat it, drink it, inhale it or even if some of it gets in through your skin,” Birnbaum said. “They’ll build up in us.”
While advanced treatment technology to remove PFAS from wastewater exists, most facilities do not have it. None of the 22 facilities included in the study employed PFAS removal technology, the Waterkeeper Alliance said.
The report’s findings underscore the need for stricter limits on PFAS discharges from industry sources, said Kelly Hunter Foster, the alliance’s senior attorney. Absent federal standards, restrictions on PFAS discharge are left to state or municipal authorities, she said.
The lack of Environmental Protection Agency guidance places an unfair burden on cities that lack both the technology to remove PFAS from treated water and the expertise to determine the acceptable level of any given chemical, said Hunter Foster.
The result is a regulatory free-for-all. All but one of the treatment facilities analyzed in the study process water from industrial users that have no restrictions on the concentration of PFAS in their wastewater.
In 2024, the EPA under the Biden administration set its first nationwide, enforceable limits on six PFAS compounds in drinking water.
Countless more PFAS chemicals may be harmful to humans and wildlife alike. “I don’t know that any of these chemicals are completely non-toxic,” said Birnbaum, the former federal toxicologist. PFAS left out of EPA regulation are less understood, not necessarily less dangerous, she added: “If you don’t look, you don’t know.”
And the new EPA rules are now slated to be pared back. The Trump administration said in May that it plans to delay enforcement of two of the Biden-era PFAS limits while rescinding the other four.
The Waterkeeper Alliance study identified as many as 14 different PFAS types in a single sampling site, and a total of 19 across the locations. Several of the compounds most commonly found at elevated levels downstream of treatment facilities in the study are not among those with EPA drinking water limits.
Currently, the EPA does not have any PFAS effluent limits or pretreatment standards, regulations that would restrain the ability of industry sources to discharge PFAS in the wastewater they send to treatment facilities.
“The lack of federal standards makes it impossible to keep the PFAS out of the system,” said Hunter Foster.
The new report includes policy recommendations calling for nationwide regulation of PFAS that treats the chemicals as a class, rather than individual substances, and the eventual phasing out of PFAS production and use.
A complete reduction in PFAS production is critical, Birnbaum argued. “Turn off the tap,” she said. “We’ve got to stop making these things.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2667-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

The contest — coordinated by the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Nebraska Manufacturing Alliance — has become an increasingly popular way to draw attention to the state’s manufacturing industry and products made in Nebraska-based facilities. Voter participation in the contest has grown each year.
“Manufacturing is so much more than meets the eye. It’s technology, agriculture, energy, and a driving force behind the Nebraska economy,” said Nebraska Chamber President Todd Bingham.  “We’re thrilled to showcase the cool things made right here in Nebraska every day that benefit the lives of Nebraskans and beyond.”
Voting is open to the public, with all Nebraskans invited to advance their favorite product to the next round. The winner will be announced at the NE Chamber’s 2025 Manufacturing Summit, this year to take place Oct. 6 in La Vista. 
The summit coincides with National Manufacturing Month in October.
“Manufacturing drives innovation and growth across countless industries throughout the state,” said Marc Hock, Pinnacle Bank president, which also is a partner in this year’s competition.
Last year, the “Coolest Thing” top honor went to Valley Irrigation’s center pivot irrigation machine. The year before that, the winner was Rocket Mobility’s all-terrain tracked wheelchair made in Columbus.
In 2022, the inaugural winner was Kawasaki’s subway car built in Lincoln to run on the rail tracks of New York City.

(Photo courtesy of Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)The Oregon Department of Transportation plans to lay off up to 700 employees as soon as the week of July 7, with layoffs taking effect by the end of the month, according to emails from agency leadership obtained by the Oregon Capital Chronicle.
The move comes after the Oregon Legislature adjourned for the year Friday without passing a transportation funding bill that the department needs to maintain staff and close a more than $300 million shortfall.
ODOT Director Kristopher Strickler said in a 12:22 a.m. email to staff Saturday — sent just hours after House Republicans voted not to move on a funding bill for the agency — that the Legislature’s inability to pass a transportation package to keep the agency solvent is “shocking, scary and frustrating.” 
Strickler said the email was “the hardest message I’ve ever had to send in my career.” Employees who do jobs that are funded by the state highway fund will be most vulnerable to layoffs, he wrote, but the agency is trying to save as many positions as possible by leaving current vacancies unfilled. Still, they said, between 600 and 700 employees would likely be laid off.
The consequences of the Legislature’s inaction go beyond staffing cuts, according to transportation advocates and local transit agencies, which are preparing for broader challenges to maintain their own aging infrastructure.
House Bill 2025, in its original form, would have raised the state gas and payroll taxes, increased vehicle licensing and registration fees and created new taxes on car sales to generate nearly $14.6 billion for the Oregon Department of Transportation and local governments over the next 10 years. By the last day of the session, lawmakers failed to pass a watered-down version that would’ve raised $2 billion over the next decade only for the state transportation department, by raising the state gas tax 3 cents and increasing licensing and registration fees.
Strickler said the only way out of the agency’s budget problem is for the Legislature to dedicate additional funding or provide more flexibility in how current funds are spent. He said the costs for inaction from the Legislature will be long-term.
“It’s sure to cost the state more in the long run as our assets deteriorate. And that doesn’t even account for the immense cost of losing the valuable, irreplaceable knowledge that resides in the ODOT people who have dedicated years – sometimes decades – of their lives to making our agency and transportation system safe and reliable,” he wrote to staff.
 Local officials, transportation advocates express disappointment

Some advocates and public officials are urging lawmakers to take action in a special session.
The Oregon Transit Association expressed concern that Oregonians would lose access to public transit, pointing to the financial strain and high operation costs transit agencies are already facing. The original transportation proposal would have increased the portion of state payroll taxes that go to public transit from 0.1% to 0.3% over several years. Without an increase, officials at TriMet, Portland’s public transit agency, said they have to cut 27% of their bus service, eliminating 45 of 79 bus lines.
“Vital infrastructure jobs are on the line, and our ability to deliver basic safety services like filling potholes and improving traffic conditions is at risk,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson told the Capital Chronicle. “I urge the legislature to act quickly and deliver a solution that supports all Oregon communities, including Portland.”
Like Wilson, Bend Mayor Melanie Kebler previously testified in favor of House Bill 2025, which she said would have especially helped fund safety maintenance needed throughout Highway 97 in Central Oregon.
However, Kebler opposed lawmakers’ last attempt at a transportation package, House Bill 3402, which proposed to raise taxes and fees to fund the Oregon Department of Transportation and would not have extended any additional funding to cities and counties.
“Any revenue increase for transportation needs to be shared fairly with cities so that we can keep up with increasing demands on our local systems in the face of rising costs,” Kebler told the Capital Chronicle.
The City of Bend has worked in past years to increase its transportation funding, but it cannot do it alone, Kebler said, adding that she’s hopeful lawmakers will return for a special session.
Without a transportation package, counties will be unable to afford safety upgrades such as reflective striping, rumble strips and guard rails, according to Erin Good, a spokesperson for the Association of Oregon Counties. Investments in bridge replacements and improvements to emergency response routes won’t happen, and counties will face staff reductions, resulting in less resources for pavement repairs, pothole fixes and routine infrastructure maintenance, she said.
Brett Morgan, a lobbyist and transportation policy director at the nonprofit environmental group Climate Solutions said the package could have saved lives.
“These investments could have made a real difference for Oregonians: they would have meant fewer crashes, more lives saved, and stable transit funding that would have enabled people to get to work, school, or the doctor’s office,” Morgan said. “Oregonians deserve a transportation system that is safe, clean, and fair. We will continue to fight to make that vision a reality.”

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.
“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

The costliest scam, however, has remained largely unquestioned: economic development incentives.
Providing tax breaks and subsidies to relocating corporations was agreed to be a dreary but unavoidable burden of being Southern, like sweating through a hot, humid August. But there has recently been a bit of a glasnost–an opening of debate–on this long-closed topic. Many North Carolinians are coming to understand that incentives are an irredeemable racket.
A determination to recruit northern businesses has been part of North Carolina’s political DNA for over 100 years. Long burdened by a history of rural poverty, state leaders believed that North Carolina must lift itself out of provincial deprivation by persuading Yankee enterprises to move south.
“Industrial recruitment” became so deeply lodged in the state’s political DNA that few people questioned even the most extravagant efforts to woo the cigar-smoking panjandrums on Wall Street and State Street. In the 1950s, Luther Hodges played Governor Goof Ball by posing on a magazine cover with his pants pulled down to reveal North Carolina-made underwear. North Carolinians did not consider this an embarrassment.
We’ve always been the eager seekers gazing at corporate prizes–jobs, factories, relief from grinding poverty. But we did not go so far as to directly subsidize industrial prospects until the 1990s. When Alabama won a big Mercedes plant that the German automaker had dangled before several southern states, North Carolina leaders decided that we needed to “get in the game” by providing corporate incentives. Since then, we have distributed countless millions of dollars to out-of-state corporations in return for the promise of jobs.
This policy was never based upon sound economics. Economists have long been nearly unanimous in the conclusion that incentives are not an effective economic development tool. Incentives create some jobs by bringing in new companies but destroy other jobs by causing local firms, which are placed at a disadvantage by the subsidies going to out-of-state rivals, to cut jobs on their own shop floors.
Recruitment “deals” also necessitate tax increases by increasing the demand for roads and schools, which further mitigates the benefit of the new company’s investment. States that offer incentives are like Lewis Carroll’s Red Queen, moving tirelessly but making no progress.
Still, North Carolina has offered incentives for decades. But the wasteful nature of this “game” has become so undeniable that abolishing incentives has become a topic of debate. It reflects well on our state’s political culture that the practice of providing incentives has become controversial. In South Carolina, corporate welfare is civic religion. We, by contrast, seem to be learning a lesson from a growing roster of deals gone bust.
One incentives-funded project after another has been cancelled by its corporate benefactor, with the state struggling to recover losses from subsidies already paid out.
Telecommuting has made it effectively impossible to recruit the best knowledge industry jobs, and the manufacturing plants we’re attempting to woo to our state sometimes aren’t getting built. And as the left-leaning writer Harold Meyerson has observed, non-union manufacturing jobs (which is what they are most likely to be in a state where the anti-labor “right-to-work” policy has been enshrined in the state constitution) are often not even good jobs at all. Median income in knowledge economy Raleigh is $14,000 higher than in Greenville, South Carolina, which with the help of incentives has brought in thousands of non-union jobs in auto manufacturing.
I used to think that at least some economic development incentives could pay off. Specifically, I was persuaded by the work of Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti that huge “Million-Dollar Plants” could create so many ancillary jobs that they could transform an entire regional economy. With thousands of new jobs reshaping an area, even a large fiscal subsidy could be justified.
But North Carolina has attempted to play that game, and the state has offered such lavish subsidies for these plants that it has simply become unreasonable. For example, the state offered one auto manufacturer a $1.5 billion package for a $1.6 billion plant. If the state had landed that deal, taxpayers would have subsidized almost the entire cost of the company’s facility.
This has gotten out of hand. At a time when public finances are already under stress, we are allocating scarce resources to corporations that have serially reneged on their promises to create jobs. We have spent decades playing a dirty game with other southern states that has served largely to enrich corporations that have little genuine commitment to North Carolina. It’s finally time to desist. Perhaps, going forward, public dollars should support the public good.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Money-chalkboard-Getty.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Brian Hardin of Gering, a bill that included a provision from Hardin at Pillen's request to outlaw child sexual abuse material generated with artifical intelligence. May 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As the federal “one big beautiful bill” continues to move through Congress, one provision related to AI that Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and 16 other Republican governors opposed has been removed, at least for now.
The ever-changing federal legislation, a key priority of President Donald Trump, passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22, 215-214, and the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, 51-50. The House version would prohibit states from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade, raising concern it could entangle state laws against AI-generated child sexual abuse material or the nonconsensual use of someone’s likeness in intimate images. The Senate voted 99-1 to remove the provision related to AI.
However, as the priority legislation of President Donald Trump returns to the House, the AI components could return. U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., has already introduced an amendment to revert the bill to the House version and “delete their dud.”
Nebraska lawmakers passed two laws in May related to AI that Pillen signed into law. They currently are set to go into effect in early September:

Legislative Bill 172, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering at Pillen’s request, prohibits AI-generated child pornography. Passed 46-3 as part of LB 383.
LB 371, from State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, provides civil liability for sharing AI-generated or computer-generated intimate images without the depicted person’s consent. Passed 49-0.

Pillen has joined a push led by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders against the AI moratorium and said he was proud to defend “smart, commonsense protections.”
“AI holds great promise for innovation across our economy, but it also poses a grave threat to our kids if it is abused,” Pillen said in a Saturday post on X, formerly Twitter. “State leaders know best how to strike this balance, and Congress should respect that.”
Senate votes 99-1 to remove AI moratorium from megabill

Hardin, who joined Pillen for a bill signing of the “commonsense” legislation May 30, said lawmakers could never have envisioned the world of AI decades ago when writing existing laws protecting children. Pillen said he knows “it turns all of our Nebraska stomachs because of the values of what we believe in,” that there are predators taking advantage of young people.
Said Hardin: “Thanks so much to [Attorney General Mike Hilgers] and his staff for helping us wade through these dangerous waters that, frankly, our federal government has been waiting for other leadership to happen.”
The Nebraska Examiner asked Hilgers and his office at that bill signing if the Nebraska laws would be impacted by the federal legislation. They were unsure at the time.
The governors argued that the technology is already “deeply entrenched in American industry and society” and will be used throughout society over the next decade, “for harm and good.”
“That Congress is burying a provision that will strip the right of any state to regulate this technology in any way – without a thoughtful public debate – is the antithesis of what our Founders envisioned,” the governors wrote.

Critics said it went too far by cutting off access to documents such as receipts and reimbursements that would not risk personal safety. (John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)
The Republican officials said they support Trump’s bill and his “vision of American AI dominance,” but they said they couldn’t “support a provision that takes away states’ powers to protect our citizens.”
“Let states function as the laboratories of democracy they were intended to be and allow state leaders to protect our people,” the governors wrote.
Also joining the letter: Govs. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Mike Dunleavy of Alaska, Brian Kemp of Georgia, Brad Little of Idaho, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Jeff Landry of Louisiana, Mike Kehoe of Missouri, Greg Gianforte of Montana, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Larry Rhoden of South Dakota, Bill Lee of Tennessee, Spencer Cox of Utah and Mark Gordon of Wyoming.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who led the amendment to remove the AI moratorium altogether, had briefly struck a deal to at least protect the AI laws related to online safety and protecting children that Nebraska and other states had enacted. 
“I regret that we weren’t able to come to a compromise that would protect our governors, our state legislators, our attorney generals and, of course, House members who have expressed concern over this language,” she said in a floor speech.
Blackburn continued: “But what we know is this: This body has proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology.”

Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, with his stack of bills at the end of the 69th Montana Legislature. (Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)The problem didn’t start this year. In fact, it probably started, like so many things, around the COVID-19 pandemic when lawmakers had to figure out how to hold legislative meetings safely, without the spread of the virus.
But as the Montana Legislature has seen a record number of bill drafts, more interim committees in between legislative sessions, and implementation of a new database because the longtime computer server was nearly dead, the number of compensatory hours, — or additional work hours — Legislative Services Division employees have banked has ballooned to more than 15,000 hours.
The issue, first reported by the Montana Free Press, can be broken down in a number of ways. For perspective, 15,000 hours is roughly the equivalent of two-years’ worth of time. In a state department that numbers around 100, that translates to an additional work-month of time off for the average full-time employee, although the director of Legislative Services, Jerry Howe, notes that the comp time is not necessarily evenly distributed among all of its employees.
However, the burgeoning number of comp-time hours is an issue that continues to grow, and recently Howe and the Legislative Council, the bipartisan committee that manages the operations of the Legislature, met to talk about how to meet the challenge.
Comp time, which is used as a benefit to fairly treat staff members during the long and sometimes grueling legislative session held every two years for 90 days, is a tool to avoid what would be either an oversized staff or exorbitant overtime.
However, Montana law caps comp time at 120 hours per employee, Howe explained, and at the end of the year, any comp in excess of the equivalent of three full-time weeks off is wiped out, essentially shorting employees who have worked the hours but didn’t get compensated. That thought keeps Howe up at night.
“It’s not just that this happens every two years, for a busy session. It’s that we have people who work here their entire careers. Employee morale is my top concern,” he said. “I’ve got to figure out how we get our staff time to decompress, recharge the batteries and enjoy this beautiful state we all love.”
Montana Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said that he wants to make sure the state is fair to its employees who have worked such long hours at the behest of the lawmakers.
“They deserve to either have the vacation time or a buy-out,” he said.
One of the other compounding factors in this comp-time puzzle is that the additional time is already on top of normal benefits, like personal time off or vacation time.
  More work, same staff 

The causes for the comp time conundrum are multi-faceted: High numbers of bills introduced, high number of amendments, extra committees during the interim, and new technology, including remote meetings that take considerably more time and expertise to run.
For example, two special committees created after the 2023 session included one established to consider voting regulations and another to look at the state’s judiciary, a top priority for the Republican majority. Then, there was a special committee during the 2025 session that investigated former Senate President Jason Ellsworth for ethical violations. Howe told the Daily Montanan that the committee took huge staff time, amounting to more than 1,000 hours after it was completed.
During session, the Legislative Services Division wrestled with a new database to track and display the committee meetings, all the bills and their respective amendments. It replaced technology that had been in use for nearly two decades, but was on the verge of failing after the original software developer said that it would no longer be supporting it, causing Howe and his information-technology team to begin migrating to a new server and software that would normally be a four-year process. Instead, his team attempted to do it in 14 months.
Also, a lawsuit now before the Montana Supreme Court regarding whether junque files, which are the drafting files kept by Legislative Services for every bill and resolution introduced, are part of Montana’s public records. That lawsuit, which is being litigated in part by a coalition of media, including the Daily Montanan, has also taken considerable time, Howe said — one of many atypical but not necessarily rare occurrences that has contributed to the increase in comp time.
“None of those things can be put off,” Howe said. “One thing that impresses me about the Legislative Services staff is how dedicated they are to the legislators and the legislative process.”
Howe said Montana has experienced busy legislative sessions previously. It has experienced busy interims — the time between the legislative sessions. But, it has never experienced busy times back to back to back, seemingly without an end. That trend, Howe said, is new.
  No one solution, but several possible solutions 

Howe also identified four different options or “levers,” the Legislature has to address the problem, including adding full-time staff; buying out compensatory time; limiting the number of interim studies; or limiting the number of bill drafts or changing rules about bills requiring legislative hearing.
“We have these different levers we can pull, and we have to decide which ones to pull and when, and it will probably be a combination of all of them,” Howe said. “You don’t get into this situation with one really busy interim or one long session. They build up. They accrue.”
Previously, the Legislature has considered “buying back” the comp time, Howe said, but that measure failed this session. In 2023, the Legislature spent $325,000 to buy down comp time. This session, there was a proposal for “buying back” another $300,000, but that failed.
Regier has been both the Senate’s top leader as well as a former Montana Speaker of the House. As a part of the Legislative Council, he said lawmakers from both parties are wrestling with this issue.
He said unexpected things, like the thousand-plus hours of work for the “Ellsworth investigation,” were unforeseen.
“I hope to never have another ethics committee meeting again,” he said.
Instead, Regier said the problem of too much work is something that is being created by the Legislature, therefore the solution probably lies within the Legislature, as well.
He said that legislative leadership needs to better prioritize bills and amendments to bills — which take top priority during the busy legislative session.
“Our legislative staff has delivered. They have an incredible work ethic,” Regier said. “Sometimes, our lawmakers don’t know what they’re asking.”
For example, holding a remote session can take days of advance notice and technological hurdles for the IT department in order to ensure that public participation, mandated by state law, can be available virtually anywhere in the state.
Regier said even some very small changes could make big impacts. For example, as the legislative session winds down, some lawmakers have less to do — no new bills to introduce. Instead, they begin proposing topics for lawmakers to study when the Legislature is not in session. And the number of study bills and topics has ballooned. Regier suggested that simply walking back the deadline for interim study bills could help lighten the workload.
  Not just Montana 

Howe, who has worked for the Utah Legislature and stays in contact with counterparts from other states, especially those in the West, says the problem is one that many western states are experiencing as national issues bleed down into state politics.
Howe said that in a place that prides itself on being a “citizen Legislature,” many Montana lawmakers aren’t experts in law or even how state code works. Sometimes, ideas from constituents come to Legislative Services scrawled on the back of a napkin or scratch paper. But taking those ideas and changing laws through the state’s code can take weeks or months, even for ideas that seem straightforward.
“These ideas seem so easy,” Howe said. “But most people just don’t have the understanding of how laws relate to one another and how they are organized in code. Public policy is not a simple endeavor. If it were, we would not need to meet constantly and continuously.”
Some of the increase in work is also natural, Howe said. Montana, like many other states in the West after COVID, is growing. And that growth can challenge laws or aspects that haven’t been touched for years — if not, decades.
“The policies of the 1940s and ‘50s don’t work anymore, and the policy needs to adapt to that environment,” he said.
Some of the work increase is also related to term limits. Many lawmakers request fewer bill drafts and have a better handle on state law the longer they serve in the Legislature, Howe said. However, with term limits, legislative staff is often re-teaching or explaining the legal and legislative process to new members.
“People kind of hit their stride when they’re nearing the end of their limits,” Howe said.
Howe would love to believe that the long hours and the complex back-to-back-to-back sessions and their interims were an outlier, but he said as the appetite to legislate continues to be brisk, driven in part by national politics, he is also looking ahead. And Montana, like many other states, may be called into special session to patch budget holes created by Congress.
If that happens, there’ll be a sort of double-whammy: More demand for legislative services and less time to spend down comp time.
“We don’t know what is in the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and how will affect us,” Howe said. “But cuts in Congress could mean a special session in Montana as well as other states.”
And that translates to more staff time for Legislative Services.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4046.jpg,,,2025-07-02 11:02:36.924430

State takeovers have been employed during the recent era of education reform aimed at closing the achievement gap separating lower-income students and students of color from their better-off, white peers. But the evidence supporting the moves has been decidedly underwhelming. 
The post As Holyoke schools exit state oversight, new scrutiny for receivership l[...]","WHEN THE FORMAL announcement came at last week’s state board of education meeting that the Holyoke public schools were being released from receivership after 10 years of state oversight, board member Michael Moriarty said the quiet part out loud. 
“Academic outcomes are not the reason we’re coming out of receivership,” Moriarty said. “We all acknowledge it, we all know that’s the work we’re going to be working very hard at doing.” 
The press release from the state education department announcing the exit from receivership touted Holyoke’s improved graduation rates, greater high school enrollment in advanced coursework, and other outcomes. But it steered clear of any mention of core academic outcomes. 
That may be because driving achievement gains was a central argument for the 2010 law that gave the state authority to take over chronically underperforming districts. The legislation, dubbed The Achievement Gap Act, was seen as a way to charge through the thicket of local in-fighting, poor management, and restrictions imposed by teachers’ contracts in order to get schools and students on track in the most troubled districts. Under the law, a state-appointed receiver is given broad power to make changes in the district, including reconfiguring schools, making curriculum changes, and overriding provisions of union contracts.  
State takeovers have been employed during the recent era of education reform aimed at closing the achievement gap separating lower-income students and students of color from their better-off, white peers. But the evidence supporting the moves has been decidedly underwhelming.  
In Holyoke, on the most recent MCAS, just 8 percent of its students in grades 3-8 met or exceeded expectations in English language arts and only 6 percent did so in math. 
One of the most comprehensive reviews of the state takeover strategy, carried out by Beth Schueler, an associate professor of education at the University of Virginia, and Joshua Bleiberg of the Annenberg Institute for Education Reform at Brown University, looked at 35 districts, spanning 14 states, that were taken over by state authorities between 2011 and 2016. The analysis included two Massachusetts districts, Lawrence and Holyoke, that were under state control at the time. “Overall, we find no evidence that state takeover improves academic achievement,” they wrote in a 2021 paper.   
While state takeovers did not, overall, lead to clear gains in student achievement, some districts did see improvement, while achievement in others was flat, and some saw a dip in performance. That prompted Schueler to explore whether there might be common features of districts that saw positive outcomes under state receivership.  
In a new paper, Schueler suggests that state takeovers that provide some role for decision-making at the local level may produce better results. She looked at the three Massachusetts districts that have been put in state receivership under the 2010 law – Lawrence, Holyoke, and Southbridge – as well as a cohort of Springfield schools operating under a state-district partnership that was formed in 2014 as an alternative to full state takeover.  
Schueler found little evidence of improvement in Holyoke and Southbridge but found gains in the early years of the Lawrence takeover, especially in math, that have largely been sustained and “generally positive to neutral effects on student academic outcomes” in the Springfield Empowerment Zone. In both Lawrence and Springfield, the takeover models allowed for more school-level decision-making as well as some local say in the governing oversight boards directing the turnaround.  
That kind of “multilevel governance,” Schueler said, might be a model that uses state authority to make necessary changes in things like school schedules and curriculum while avoiding the “potentially more negative effects of takeovers” that might come from cutting out any local voice in decision-making.  
Paul Reville, who authored the 2010 reform law as state education secretary under Gov. Deval Patrick, called it a “reasonable hypothesis” that including some local voice in state takeovers could make them more effective.  
Critics, including the state’s two main teachers unions, have called for stripping the state of authority to take control of underperforming districts. But even as he welcomed the return of the school system to local control, Holyoke Mayor Joshua Garcia said the takeover made sense at the time, with the district mired in dysfunction. 
“The temporary pivot was necessary,” Garcia said last Monday at the Holyoke School Committee’s weekly meeting. Garcia, who, as mayor, chairs the school committee, was an elected school committee member at the time of the 2015 takeover, and said he was “frustrated about what was going on in our district and happy that receivership came in to help blow things up a little bit.”  
Reville still thinks the takeover authority is an important tool for the state to use when districts are struggling to gain traction or suffering from persistently poor local management, but he said it’s increasingly clear that school-focused reforms alone – including receivership – can’t overcome the impact of entrenched poverty and disadvantage present in districts targeted for state intervention. It’s “insufficient to remedy the achievement gap in places like Holyoke,” said Reville. Of the district’s 4,800 students, 84 percent live in low-income households and almost 20 percent are English learners.  
“I think it’s a good step in the right direction,” said Reville of the measures taken under receivership, such as expansion of Holyoke’s dual language programs, addition of pre-K seats, and redesign of the city’s high school. “But a schools-only solution isn’t going to do it,” Reville said, pointing to broader factors such as stable housing for the city’s high-poverty population and adequate health care as out-of-school variables that can play a huge role in student success. 
Reville, now a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, directs a project there called the EdRedesign Lab, focused on identifying ways to promote that kind of holistic approach to student learning. If society is serious about closing yawning achievement gaps, he said, it must be willing to tackle things like housing insecurity and lack of access to extracurricular enrichment activities that put lower-income students at such disadvantage.   
“It just takes more to educate kids who have significant challenges associated with poverty to a level we recognize as sufficient,” he said. “We don’t want to reckon with it because of the cost.”

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order.”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents’ status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that was a misinterpretation of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which he contends was never intended to apply to everyone.
Judge sets deadline for administration to put birthright citizenship plans in writing

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S. democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order.
In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
It allowed Trump’s birthright citizenship order to take effect in the 28 states, including South Carolina, that were not part of the initial lawsuits challenging it.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally.
That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The latest filing involves pregnant immigrants living in nine states, including South Carolina.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard.
On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

Ned Lamont’s recent veto of a sweeping housing bill focusing largely on zoning reform, several other laws signed this year will help more people find affordable places to live.
Advocates for housing affordability programs say one major achievement during the most recent legislative session, which ended in early June, was an increase in funding and capacity for Connecticut’s Rental Assistance Program (RAP).
An approved bill will provide $18 million for the program, according to Chelsea Ross, executive director of the housing advocacy nonprofit Partnership for Strong Communities.
The bill provides 275 vouchers for families with young children through Head Start on Housing, 100 for people with intellectual disabilities and 325 for elderly and disabled people, with a priority for those most at risk of homelessness, Ross said.
“That was a big win for housing stability for folks, and RAP typically serves people who are experiencing homelessness and other high need populations,” Ross said.
The new state budget includes a 9% increase in RAP funding for the new fiscal year, which starts this month, and a 30% increase for fiscal year 2026-27, Ross said.
With six housing-related bills that passed, state lawmakers are chipping away at Connecticut’s housing affordability crisis, Ross said.
“They’re wins, but they’re very small, and they weren’t things that folks were pushing,” Ross said. “They’re more of technical changes and fixes that strengthen existing practices, not things that people sort of have been hard fighting for.”
The small wins include establishing an interagency council on homelessness and a task force to study the rise in corporate ownership of apartment buildings, she said.
A bonding bill also included an annual $150 million for the next two years to support the state’s Housing Trust Fund, which would primarily go toward developing workforce, or middle-income, housing developments.
“There’s also programs around supportive housing, middle housing in smaller towns, home ownership initiatives and housing for people leaving incarceration,” Ross said. “The administration and the legislature was able to show real recognition of the need to build and preserve affordable housing at scale.”
Lawmakers and housing advocates are also looking to the future, and considering which measures that failed to pass this year should be reconsidered in a special session this summer or during next year’s legislative session.
One such measure would place limitations on the ability of landlords to not renew a lease. Ross said the push for so-called just cause eviction protections will be renewed next year.
State Rep. Eleni Kavros-DeGraw, a Democrat who represents Avon and Canton, recently said the proposal is evolving as lawmakers reconsider it each year.
“I certainly think that there were more people who understood it and were leaning in the direction of voting for it than we have had before,” Kavros-DeGraw said. “There’s something to be said for the iterative process. I think that that iterative process will be important for just cause.”

(Photo by Sundry Photography/Getty)Rhode Island now has one of the highest maximum fines in New England for those convicted of driving the wrong way on a highway or a highway entrance or exit ramp after after Gov. Dan McKee signed legislation significantly increasing the penalty into law last week.
The penalty if convicted is now a fine of up to $500 and the suspension of a driver’s license for up to six months under legislation sponsored by House Deputy Speaker Raymond A. Hull, a Providence Democrat, and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Matthew L. LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat. Previously the maximum fine was $85.
McKee signed the legislation on June 26.
“We have all seen the tragic news stories about horrible accidents occurring because people were driving the wrong way on the highway,” Hull said in a statement. “Such actions are beyond dangerous for the driver and anyone else unlucky enough to be using the road at the same time. Hopefully, these increased penalties will deter such unsafe behavior.” 
“Driving the wrong way on the highway puts everyone at considerable risk and this danger is only increased if it takes place during the night,” LaMountain said in a statement. “This legislation will hold people accountable for such hazardous conduct and hopefully, it will protect innocent people on our state’s highways from becoming victims in catastrophic accidents.” 
In Massachusetts, traveling in the wrong direction could lead to a fine between $50 and $500, the higher range for Boston’s Sumner, Callahan, or Ted Williams tunnels.
The maximum fine for a wrong way highway violation is $220 in Vermont, $183 in Connecticut, $180 in Maine and $150 in New Hampshire, according to state police officials in those states. But other charges may apply as well. In Maine, for example, an additional charge of driving to endanger is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and six months in jail.
The legislation received strong support from AAA Northeast. Fatal wrong-way driving crashes on U.S. divided highways led to 2,008 deaths between 2015 and 2018, according to a report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety cited in a letter submitted to the House Committee on Judiciary in March by AAA Northeast Vice President of Public and Government affairs Mary Maguire. That number represented a dramatic spike in fatalities across the country: A total of 375 deaths resulted from wrong-way driving in the years spanning 2010 to 2014.
Alcohol impairment, increasing age and driving without a passenger were identified as three main factors contributing to wrong-way driving, the AAA report found.
Approximately 43% of fatal crashes in Rhode Island involve drunk driving, which ties the state with South Carolina for the highest percentage of alcohol-related fatal crashes in the nation. The national average is 30%.
The Rhode Island Department of Transportation installed wrong way driver detection systems at 24 high-risk areas, mostly in the Providence area, in 2015. A driver who enters a highway off-ramp activates a series of flashing signs and the system also notifies the Rhode Island State Police and takes a picture of the vehicle. The system displays a message on overhead signs to warn drivers heading in the opposite direction.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Corrections announced that 35 men that were arrested and detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from out of state and held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex were transferred out of state on Monday.
ICE transferred 42 men to Alaska from out of state on June 8, as part of an ongoing agreement between the Department of Corrections and the U.S. Department of Justice, amid a nationwide deportation crackdown. The move sparked daily protests, a fact-finding hearing by the Alaska House Judiciary Committee, and concerns from attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska around the punitive conditions of detention, violations of due process and criminal confinement.  
A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said department Commissioner Jen Winkelman was not available for an interview on Tuesday to discuss the transfer, concerns around conditions of detention, and ongoing plans to house ICE detainees in Alaska.
“The ICE detainees who were transferred due to severe overcrowding in the Washington facility are no longer in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections,” said DOC spokesperson Betsy Holley in an email, in which she included the italics and underlining. She added that all questions on the details of the transfer should be directed to DHS/ICE. 
Cindy Woods, a senior immigration law and policy fellow with the ACLU of Alaska, said the transfer was not unexpected, since DOC had said they agreed to hold detainees for 30 days. She also said she and several other attorneys were not notified of the transfers. 
“Yesterday evening, I flagged the attorneys that I know represent folks who had been transferred, to let them know that they were being transferred again, and but none of them had been told by ICE prior to that,” she said. 
Woods said all the detainees were going through civil immigration proceedings, and faced no criminal charges. 
“These individuals were all in civil detention, so they were not being detained as part of an ongoing criminal proceeding. They were all in administrative immigration proceedings,” she said, and a number of the men have applied for or received asylum protections.
“And then there were also a handful of folks who were waiting for their immigration proceedings to commence,” she said. “And so (they) were waiting for the opportunity to speak with a judge about either a potential asylum claim or some other request for immigration relief.”
The ICE transfer of detainees to Alaska DOC custody raised serious concerns around standards of detention from legislators and advocates. Attorneys testified before the June 20 hearing of the Alaska House Judiciary Committee that despite no criminal charges, their clients reported that they were subject to lengthy lockdowns, overuse of handcuffs and overcrowding — sleeping three to a cell. In addition, they were denied or had limited access to calls with family and attorneys, regularly strip-searched after visits with attorneys, and subjected to use of force by DOC staff members, who pepper-sprayed a unit to stop a “verbal demonstration” on June 12, the attorneys said.
The ACLU of Alaska sent a letter on Saturday to Alaska state officials and ICE demanding detainees be removed from Anchorage Correctional Complex custody, and a stop to any additional transfers “unless and until constitutionally adequate conditions of confinement and attorney access can be guaranteed.”
The letter provided further detail on the pepper-spray incident: “This ‘verbal demonstration’ consisted of detainees requesting access to their belongings, including an individual who was trying to access his property to get the phone number for his consulate. Following the incident, many individuals experienced respiratory distress, including coughing, burning sensations in their mouth, nose, and eyes, and nosebleeds, and did not receive medical attention. They were also unable to change their clothes for an extended period of time.”
Holley said in the Department of Corrections’ emailed response to an interview request that the state did not make the call to transfer the detainees.
“The decision to transfer these detainees out of Alaska rested solely with the federal government. The decision was not influenced by the recent House Judiciary Committee hearing or the letter issued by the ACLU this past weekend,” Holley said. 
“It is important to note the Alaska DOC routinely houses both civil detainees and federal prisoners. While we do not currently know whether ICE will request additional placements in the future, the Alaska DOC remains fully prepared to support DHS/ICE in coordinated efforts that prioritize public safety and the efficient use of government resources.”
The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections in May challenging what they say is “inadequate, dangerous and inhumane” health care provided for incarcerated Alaskans. 
Woods said the DOC protocols and detention conditions are unnecessary, and violated the men’s right to due process. “The conditions that they were all held in were punitive, whether or not that was the intention of the government, and such punitive nature are clearly outside the scope of the law, and especially when it comes to the standards and the requirements for civil detainees, who are not being held under criminal charges,” she said.
ICE did not respond to requests for comment about why the detainees were transferred to and from Alaska. Woods said she was able to search in the ICE inmate locator and confirm the men were transferred back to the ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, with reportedly better conditions.
Woods said detainees reported the experience in DOC custody as humiliating.
“They were being held in really substandard conditions, being subjected to pepper spray and strip searches, and handcuffs, and all of those things. And so it was really hard for a lot of people to deal with that shift,” she said, referring to being transferred from Washington state to Alaska custody. “And especially because they were also largely cut off from those outside relationships that sustained them, particularly those who, you know, regularly spoke with their children and their parents and their loved ones who were not located in the United States — having that kind of completely shut off really impacted the individuals who experienced that.”
On Friday, seven U.S. congressional representatives from Washington and Oregon sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security questioning why detainees were transferred to Alaska,  as well as the cost and criteria for who is transferred. The letter also raised concerns that “ICE is wasting taxpayer dollars, flying dozens of people between detention centers thousands of miles apart, in efforts that do nothing to help protect Americans.”

As factions in Congress go head to head over the Senate and House versions of the bill, here's what it could mean for people in Massachusetts. 
The post 5 ways Trump tax and spend bill would affect Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS CONGRESS WORKS out its sweeping tax cut and spending legislation — the budget reconciliation bill also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the word “cuts” is being thrown around a lot. But in Massachusetts, should you expect to see cuts to the government programs you rely on?
The giant policy bill has advanced through Congress with only Republican votes. After weeks of divisive debate, the U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill 51-50 on Tuesday and sent it backt to the U.S. House. Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson are eager to get it on President Donald Trump’s desk before his July 4 deadline. 
As factions in Congress go head to head over the Senate and House versions of the bill, people in Massachusetts wonder how it will impact their lives. 
Five key pieces of the legislation that will impact Massachusetts ↓ 
Tax cuts: significant if you’re high-income
Tax cuts are one of the most talked-about items in the reconciliation bill. The Senate version of the bill looks to expand tax deductions, including raising the cap on deductions for state and local taxes (SALT, for short). Both bills extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Evan Horowitz, executive director of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University said for most people in Massachusetts, their experience of paying taxes will largely stay the same, because the bills mostly extend 2017 tax policies. But, he said, for people earning between $200,000 and $500,000, higher deductions on their state and local taxes would constitute a significant cut. 
For tipped workers, about 2.5 percent of the US workforce, a new change eliminating taxes on tips could be a helpful cut, although it might impact fewer people than many realize. More than a third of tipped workers didn’t make enough money to pay federal income taxes last year, according to the Yale Budget Lab, and half earn less than $37,000 a year. This means they can already claim the standard deduction, and receive other tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. 
Roughly 68 percent of the tax cuts in the House version go to the richest 20 percent in the US, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
While working-class families — the bottom 40 percent of earners — could expect an average tax cut of $361 in 2027 under the House proposal, the nation’s highest-income families — the top 0.1 percent — would receive an average tax cut of at least $255,670 in that year, according to the Institute. These figures don’t account for anticipated cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance, which could increase costs for working-class families.
Viviana Abreu-Hernandez, president of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, said she worries about how these regressive taxation policies, which see low-income people contributing a disproportionate share as compared to high-income people, will impact the wealth gap in Massachusetts. This wealth gap, Abreu-Hernandez said, is already made worse by sales taxes in Massachusetts, which have an outsized impact on low-income people. 
Medicaid cuts: significant, especially for able-bodied adults
The House version of the bill proposed changes to Medicaid that could deprive 7.6 million people of health insurance. The Senate version would cut Medicaid even further.
In the Southcoast Health system that serves New Bedford, most people are on public pay programs like MassHealth. This puts the region at heightened risk.
Both bills propose work requirements for low-income, able-bodied adults on Medicaid. The Senate bill expands work requirements to the parents of older children as well. The requirement carries a heavy paperwork burden and would deny coverage at application if people could not demonstrate that they are employed, or otherwise engaged.
Josh Archambault, the Pioneer Institute’s senior fellow on health care policy, said this type of requirement would push people towards working.
But others say limited research does not indicate work requirements increase employment. And advocates worry that many would lose health care. 
“It’s not just the feds saying, ‘we won’t pay.’ You can’t pay. These people are ineligible for Medicaid. You can’t cover them,” said Horowitz, of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University. “In some ways, it’s actually a cost saving for the state. But I don’t think it’ll be treated that way. I think it’ll be treated as a disaster … but it’s not a budgetary problem, it’s a welfare problem.”
Ultimately, Horowitz said, people who lose insurance will still need medical care, and those costs may eventually trickle back to the state. Uncompensated care costs, he said, will be a problem to watch over the next few years should work requirements pass through Congress.
SNAP cuts: will mean significant changes to the state budget
The bills look to push some costs of the country’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto the states. SNAP, or food stamps, helps pay for groceries for more than 12 percent of the country. In fiscal year 2024, one in every six people in Massachusetts relied on SNAP, over half of them in families with children.
Under the bills’ legislation, states would have to cover a potentially large portion of SNAP funding. Horowitz worries some states may not be able to do so, opting instead to drop the portion they’d have to fund. 
“Massachusetts is not that kind of state,” Horowitz said. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario where Massachusetts … doesn’t fill in the missing federal dollars. … I think that will be a top state priority.”
Still, Horowitz said, the money to cover such a large expense has to come from somewhere, meaning other state programs face cuts. 
Student financial aid cuts: uncertain — the House bill’s changes are significant; the Senate’s are not
One such area could be student financial aid — one of the key topics the House and Senate disagree on.
The House bill’s restrictions on financial aid borrowing include cuts to Pell Grants. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey released a statement which said the bill that passed the House would result in 42,000 Massachusetts students at public colleges and universities losing $57 million in federal financial aid annually.
Healey, positioning Massachusetts as a hub for higher education and touting the success of the state’s expanded MASSGrant Plus program, called on the Senate to reject the cuts. 
While the Senate bill does bar students from qualifying for a Pell Grant if they’ve received a full scholarship separately, it would not increase the credit hours required for full- and part-time students to receive Pell Grants. 
Pell Grants are subsidized to help low-income students pay for higher education. The House bill would change eligibility requirements, causing reductions in aid and at least 10 percent of students nationally losing their grants completely. As the bill would eliminate Pell Grants entirely for students attending college less than half-time, community colleges would see the greatest impact.
While important, Horowitz said making up for Pell Grant funding is not likely to be a priority for the state. As he sees it, if the House policies on this won out, the state would not be able to make up the funding. 
Inflation Reduction Act cuts: significant for offshore wind
Former President Joe Biden’s 2022 climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, offered tax credits to clean energy projects such as wind and solar energy. That gave a big boost to the offshore wind industry, which has flourished on the South Coast. The Trump administration is seeking to end IRA tax credits, with legislation in both versions of the bill furthering this aim.
As it stands, the House bill would require all energy projects receiving tax credits to begin within 60 days of the bill implementation, and be completed by 2028, before ending the credits for any other projects. The Senate version of the bill is softer on the IRA, giving projects until 2028 to begin. 
Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey told State House News Service he was working with Republicans in the Senate to save IRA funding. Markey said he was especially focused on legislators from red states, “because 80 percent of all that funding has gone to red states in the IRA, and it’s already created 400,000 new jobs.” 
The Trump administration’s clean energy cuts could have an outsized impact on clean energy on the South Coast, and according to Kris Ohleth, director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, the House cuts would only worsen those impacts. 
The IRA made it easier to manufacture for clean energy in the US, Ohleth said, but current projects aren’t safe from changes from sweeping tariffs or changing tax credit policies. 
“There’s a very small margin in profit for these offshore wind developers,” Ohleth said. “So, any half percent change in the cost of steel, or whatever it might be, will ripple through the project and potentially make the projects unfinanceable.”
As the demand for electricity soars in coming years, thanks to technology advancements like the use of artificial intelligence, Ohleth worries about the impact of slowing a “shovel ready” energy source like offshore wind, and its supply chain, for a minimum of four years. 
“It’s not just four years,” Ohleth said. “It’s four years, plus re-establishing that type of supply chain and market confidence that we are losing.”

Laura Kelly objects to 1.5% across-the-board budget cuts ordered by Kansas Legislature,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/07/02/gov-laura-kelly-objects-to-1-5-across-the-board-budget-cuts-ordered-by-kansas-legislature/,"Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins lauds, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly criticizes of mandated 1.5% across-the-board budget cut on state agencies.","Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins, photographed during Kelly's 2025 state of the state speech in January, disagreed on the appropriateness of the Legislature's decision to compel the governor to make 1.5% spending reductions in state agencies. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly denounced across-the-board spending reductions ordered by the Kansas Legislature that sliced $189,000 from the Kansas School for the Deaf and $124,000 from the Kansas School for the Blind.
The Kansas Adjutant General’s Office lost $118,000 because of the budget mandate, while the Kansas Office of Veterans Services was nicked for $64,000.
It was all part of the $7.1 million reduction required by a bill approved by the House and Senate that took effect Tuesday with start of the state government’s new fiscal year. The Legislature mandated the governor take the money out of state general fund operating expenditures, which included agency salaries, contractual services, commodities and capital expenses.
Kelly said the Legislature’s preference for blanket reductions, rather than precision adjustments, was flawed because the result was “neither targeted nor thoughtful.”
“As governor, I have worked to get Kansas back on the right fiscal track and provide Kansans with the resources they need to prosper without risking the future of the state,” Kelly said. “I share the Legislature’s goal to reduce spending where possible and to increase efficiency in state government. However, the Legislature’s mandate to cut state agencies’ budgets across the board is not the way to increase efficiency.”
Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who is a candidate for state insurance commissioner, said the governor was wrong to oppose what he viewed as the “small 1.5%” reduction in spending decreed by Senate Bill 125.
The House voted 89-36 for the bill and Senate approved it by a margin of 24-16.
Kelly said the Legislature compelled her to strip millions of dollars from state agencies managing programs that were “vital lifelines to the most vulnerable Kansans.”
The cuts required of the governor took the biggest bite out of the Kansas Department for Children and Families by stripping $2.2 million from the agency. The second-largest loser in the Legislature’s budget was the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, which lost $1 million.
Taken together, the two agencies serving children, seniors and people with disabilities absorbed 44% of the reduction because a larger portion of their budgets came from the state general fund.
Hawkins, who controls the debate calendar in the House, said Kelly didn’t present options for shrinking state spending to the 2025 Legislature.
“This year the Legislature forced her hand with a small 1.5% across-the-board reduction,” Hawkins said. “I challenge Governor Kelly to come to the table before next session with meaningful ideas on how to make government agencies more efficient and reduce spending.”
He said if Kelly declined to present the 2026 Legislature with potential steps for lowering expenditures, “you can expect to see another across-the-board reduction.”
Typically, the starting point for annual budget debates in Kansas would be a governor’s recommended budget. GOP legislative leadership departed from precedent by establishing a special committee that drafted a budget bill for consideration by the 2025 Legislature. The objective was to set aside Kelly’s preferences so House and Senate members could concentrate on their objectives.
The final budget bill approved by the Legislature included the 1.5% across-the-board cut to state general fund expenditures.
Other reductions above $100,000 to meet the Legislature’s directive: Kansas Board of Indigents Defense Services, $919,000; Kansas Department of Health and Environment, $799,000; Office of Information Technology Services, $247,000; Kansas Department of Education, $314,000; Kansas Department of Revenue, $266,000; Kansas Department of Agriculture, $219,000; Kansas Department of Administration, $146,000; and Kansas Department of Labor, $142,000.
And, cuts to agencies with annual budgets at or below $5 million: Kansas Historical Society, $75,000; Office of the Governor, $73,000; Kansas State Library, $45,000; Kansas Board of Tax Appeals, $22,000; Kansas Guardianship Program, $21,000; Kansas Human Rights Commission, $18,000; Kansas Office of Child Advocate, $11,000; Kansas Public Disclosure Commission, $8,000; and Kansas Department of Commerce, $2,000.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kelly-SOS-3-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-02 10:03:03.139449

Like everyone who works around the state Capitol, I was shocked when I learned of the assassination of Melissa Hortman. The intimate, horrifying violence of the act, combined with the loss of such a colossal figure in our state’s politics, was one of the most jarring events of my lifetime. As a child growing up in Brooklyn, I experienced 9/11 up close. That is the only other moment I can compare it to. 
I didn’t know Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman on the same personal level as many legislators, staff and long-time politicos who might read this column, and so I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to everyone personally affected, as well as all of those who, like myself, are fearful of an increasingly violent and unstable political environment. 
There is little in the way of eulogy I could add that hasn’t already been said. She was brilliant, kind, effective, humble and a great many other wonderful things. But in the interest of commemorating a woman I greatly admired, I wanted to write about one issue on which we shared a passionate interest: Planting trees. 
I always appreciated Speaker Hortman’s love for trees and I think it is worth reflecting on the essential wisdom that this interest imparts.
From cooling and cleaning the air around them, to reducing carbon in the atmosphere, trees are one simple and elegant treatment for so many of our social challenges. Trees have been associated with greater economic activity, improved community health and even reduced violent crime.
But far more important than their tangible benefits, it is worth pausing to consider Hortman’s interest in trees as embodying a set of values about how we care for one another and our collective future. 
A commitment to trees is a commitment to future generations. It grows from an understanding that the world we want to create may not come about in our lifetimes, but is still worth our efforts. It is an acknowledgment that the process of democratic governance is one of stewardship, of envisioning and fighting for the world we want to pass on. 
At Hortman’s urging, the state passed tens of millions of dollars worth of funding for new programs aimed at increasing the density and the sustainability of Minnesota’s urban and rural forests. Our state will be healthier and more beautiful because of her efforts. 
But her even broader legacy is reflected in the countless ways she sought leave things better than we found them, often while considering the long-term horizon in which we have the greatest opportunities to improve health of our society. 
Investments in public education, for example, might not benefit high school seniors, but they could forever alter the trajectory of young children and families. Similarly, our investments in infrastructure may take time and result in frustrating disruptions to our daily routines. But in the long run they will provide us with new avenues to connect with one another.
The speaker pushed and supported countless initiatives like this, aimed at ensuring a brighter future for all. 
She also sought to stop policies that might seem pleasing in the moment but would carry negative effects in the future. One particularly close to my heart was the Social Security tax fight of 2023. Hortman was one of a relatively small number of key elected officials who recognized the damage that a top-heavy tax cut for wealthy retirees could do to our state budget. 
As a result of her leadership, the 2023 state budget cut taxes on Social Security income for those making less than $120,000 per year, but maintained them for households earning in the millions or high six-figures. As difficult as that fight was — with many Republicans and Democrats who wanted to deliver on a catchy but universally discredited policy idea — it didn’t take decades to see the importance of Hortman’s long-term thinking: Had Gov. Tim Walz signed a full Social Security income tax elimination, the 2025 deficit would have been over $1 billion larger for the recently budgeted 2026-27 biennium, and the state would have had to put more investments in health, education and environmental protections on the chopping block. 
I am going to miss Hortman’s grounded, thoughtful, far-seeing leadership, and I hope that many others follow her example.
With so much tension and vitriol focused on every headline and latest policy battle in Washington, Hortman’s passion for something as simple as trees reminds us of a larger picture and a longer story. One in which we are not separated by partisanship and geography, but intrinsically connected through our shared planet and a fluid human history of which we are all a part. 
Trees, like much of the work of creating a brighter future, are also easily taken for granted. When we are surrounded by them, we assume that they are an unalterable part of the world we live in. Or worse yet, we don’t even notice them. But the truth is that the healthy, mature trees on our streets and in our backyards were all planted by caring people decades in the past — many of whom never sat in their shade. Another essential reminder of the great collective, ongoing effort it requires to build and maintain a just society. 
Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark committed so much of their lives to the Minnesotan endeavor of creating a better world for all. 
I don’t know that we are living up to that aspiration right now, but maybe the trees all around us can serve as a grounding reminder of all that we share and owe one another as human beings.

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

The number of homeless students in California has risen in the last year.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, schools are required by federal law to count their homeless students. In the most recent data published in June, the state had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year. For the purposes of this data, the definition of homelessness is broader than the state’s point in time count. 
Though some of that increase can be attributed to California’s housing crunch, schools are also getting better at identifying students who are struggling with housing. Part of the reason could be due to a 2021 state law requiring schools to train staff to recognize potential signs of homelessness. Despite falling enrollment numbers last year, for example, the state identified 21,000 more homeless students than the year before. 
Compared to their housed peers, homeless students experience worse learning outcomes and higher rates of discipline and absenteeism. But once schools can identify who is homeless, they can also offer these students extra support, such as transportation to and from school, free school supplies and tutoring.

Barbara Duffield, executive director of Schoolhouse Connection, a national homeless youth advocacy group: “Schools can’t solve homelessness, but they can ensure the students are safe in the classroom and getting the education they need to get out of homelessness.”

Speaking of schools: CalMatters’ Tara García Mathewson and Carolyn also report that California school districts are scrambling after President Donald Trump’s administration sent notice on Monday that it is withholding crucial federal grant money that schools had already budgeted for this year. 
In March Congress approved earmarking about $6.2 billion for K-12 schools nationwide, including nearly $811 million for California. The U.S. Department of Education was expected to release the money on Tuesday, but instead sent an email to schools saying it was still reviewing the funds. The grants go toward teacher professional development, after school programs, services for students learning English and other programs. In response, the state is considering suing the Trump administration.

Congress nixes AI moratorium proposal

In a 99-1 vote, the U.S. Senate struck down a measure Monday that would have included a decade-long ban on state governments from regulating artificial intelligence in Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Tate.
Republicans joined Democrats to oppose the measure during its final vote, with some GOP lawmakers publicly denouncing the proposed moratorium as a violation of states’ rights. U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was the lone “no” vote to not strip the provision from the budget bill.
Had it passed, the proposal would have made enforcing over 20 AI-related laws California passed last year illegal, and jeopardize 30 bills the state Legislature is currently considering. 
State Sen. Josh Becker, a Menlo Park Democrat who authored a law to increase AI transparency, said in an email that he was encouraged that Congress “came to its senses.”

Becker: “In the absence of a strong federal standard, states must retain the flexibility to advance AI in ways that do not compromise safety, privacy, or the rights of our residents.”

Incarcerated firefighters closer to wage hike

Following years of advocacy, California is poised to pay its incarcerated firefighters the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour during an active fire, reports CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich. 
The proposed wage hike comes with the finalization of the state budget deal on Monday, which sets aside $10 million of ongoing funds for incarcerated firefighter wages. The Senate would still need to approve the bill that would mandate the pay raise, which advanced through the Assembly last month with strong bipartisan support. If passed, the hike will take effect Jan. 1.
For the physical and mental health strains they must undergo while carrying out their jobs, incarcerated firefighters are paid between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, and an additional $1 per hour during active emergencies.
Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat who authored the bill, said the move was “long overdue.”

Bryan: “It feels really beautiful and life changing for folks who have sacrificed to save others during their time being held accountable for whatever harms they may have caused in their past.”

During the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires in January, Cal Fire deployed at least 800 incarcerated firefighters.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year.
Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site. They require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
SC nuclear reboot sees interest from big tech, large utilities

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan.
In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push.
Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal.
Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives.
But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast.
The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller.
The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center.
The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.

“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.










We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics


Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years.
He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

,California,2025-07-02 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,How deep-pocketed groundwater users are stalling California’s sustainability plans,Scott Hayman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/groundwater-bill-california-sustainability-plans/,A legal loophole in California law is being exploited by deep-pocketed water users who use lawsuits to challenge the technical findings of plans critical to achieving sustainability.,"Guest Commentary written by

Scott Hayman
Scott Hayman is chair of the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority.


California is at a groundwater management crossroads as legal loopholes threaten to undo the state’s progress toward responsible groundwater sustainability.
At the core of this legal conflict are two legal processes. The first is the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, the landmark law passed in 2014 to bring order to overdrafting of basins and ensure long-term sustainability of the state’s groundwater resources. The second is groundwater adjudications, a legal tool to determine water rights of who can pump water and how much they can use.  
Increasingly, these two legal processes are clashing. As a result, it is causing confusion, delaying  implementation of groundwater sustainability plans and further putting California’s water future at risk. In fact, nearly a quarter of state-approved groundwater sustainability plans are being challenged in a groundwater adjudication. 
Litigants are using groundwater adjudications to challenge the technical findings of state-approved groundwater plans, data from the Department of Water Resources reveals. These plans are the product of years of science-based research, independent modeling, local stakeholder input and millions of dollars in public investment. 
The lawsuits bypass groundwater management law and are dragging every groundwater user in a basin into costly, years-long litigation, which ultimately is paid for by users who did not choose this water battle. The result? Delayed projects, regulatory uncertainty and a system that favors those who can afford to litigate over those who can’t. 
One of these legal challenges involves the critically overdrafted Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Basin, 597 square miles spanning Kern, Inyo and San Bernardino counties. As the chair of the groundwater authority responsible for managing this basin, I know firsthand the detriment of these legal loopholes.
Assembly Bill 1413 is sensible, straightforward legislation that would strengthen the state’s efforts to manage this precious resource. AB 1413 is intended to protect the right to challenging a sustainability plan, but at the same time, preserve the integrity of the groundwater law’s process and provide clarity to judges in adjudications.
AB 1413 addresses this growing problem by reaffirming the Legislature’s original intent: To afford the ability to challenge a sustainability plan by first introducing evidence as part of a validation  action. This process would be open, transparent and focused — unlike adjudications, which are  broad, expensive and often heard in a court far removed from the communities they affect.
Clarity is needed now. Judges in current adjudications have voiced frustration at the lack of legal  guidance, noting the difficulty of reconciling state law with the demands of adjudication. AB 1413 gives them the tools they need to respect both processes without compromising either. 
The bill also does not take away anyone’s legal rights. It simply ensures that technical disputes are handled in the appropriate venue, without undermining broader groundwater management law. 
Opponents state that adjudications and groundwater management law are separate and can coexist. But in practice, adjudications are being used to override local efforts and delay  sustainability measures. 
This isn’t coexistence — it’s conflict. 
Without legislative action, this conflict will only grow, negatively impacting most groundwater users, and leaving it to legal teams who can afford to fight for wealthy clients who simply want to kick the implementation of sustainability plans down the road. 
AB 1413 is not just a legal fix. It’s a defense of public process, scientific integrity and equitable  access to water governance. It ensures that all Californians — not just those with the deepest  pockets — have a voice in how our groundwater is managed. 
If lawmakers pass AB 1413, they can reaffirm California’s commitment to sustainable, community-driven water management. The future of our groundwater and the communities that depend on it are at stake.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/070622_Kern-Drought_LV_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

For months, a plan to create an infrastructure financing agency largely shielded from the public eye sailed smoothly through the state Senate. Lawmakers only backtracked when transparency advocates sounded the alarm. 


California lawmakers wanted to create a nonprofit agency authorized to borrow limitless taxpayer money to finance infrastructure projects — all while shielding most of its operations from the public eye.
Sponsored by state Treasurer Fiona Ma, SB 769 would create the Golden State Infrastructure Corporation, a nonprofit organization within the treasurer’s office that would use public and private financing for projects from transportation to housing. 
The measure initially sought to exclude virtually all of the nonprofit’s records from public disclosure and allow the organization to make decisions behind closed doors.
That kind of authority deserves public scrutiny, good government groups argued, especially as corruption scandals plagued state agencies in recent decades. The proposal follows state officials’ efforts in recent years to shroud themselves in secrecy by using burner phones and non-disclosure agreements and by introducing measures to reduce public access to records and meetings.
After good government advocates and legislative analysts raised transparency concerns, lawmakers on Tuesday approved a new version of the bill that narrows the scope of documents that would be exempt from public disclosure, though it would still allow some to remain secret.
“This is exactly the kind of business (of) the state the public has a vested interest in being able to monitor. Excessive secrecy will only undermine public trust in the corporation,” the First Amendment Coalition and Oakland Privacy wrote in a joint letter to lawmakers last month.
The nonprofit would be overseen by a five-member board including the treasurer, controller and other state appointees. 
The proposal would give the organization full discretion over its finances and would not cap how much debt it can incur. The state would also not be held liable for the organization’s financial decisions. 
Some documents would still be secret
Under the revised legislation, the nonprofit would only be allowed to keep records private if they are corporate financial documents or “critical infrastructure information” that has not been made public. The group would also only be able to hold closed sessions while discussing those records.
“I believe the amendments we are taking today strengthen the bill and strike the right balance,” Sen. Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat who authored the measure, said in a hearing Tuesday. “It will ensure the success of the infrastructure fund while maintaining the type of open and transparent governmental body the public deserves.”
Neither Caballero nor Ma responded to CalMatters’ request for comment Tuesday on why they sought to keep deliberations and records secret. 
The initial sweeping exemptions went unnoticed for months as the measure sailed through the Senate with no lawmaker raising transparency concerns. The only two senators to vote against the legislation — Sens. Brian Jones of San Diego and Steven Choi of Irvine, both Republicans — did not cite the exemptions as part of their concern. 
When asked about the lack of disclosure, Jones said in a statement that he’s deeply opposed to the entity “being completely exempt from the Public Records Act, especially in California, where government is already notorious for its lack of transparency.”
Choi spokesperson Kelley Rooney told CalMatters: “Senator Choi has consistently voted in favor of legislation that promotes government transparency and public input in the decision-making process.”

Ginny LaRoe, advocacy director of the First Amendment Coalition, told CalMatters she only flagged the proposed exemptions after the measure arrived in the Assembly. She said she wished lawmakers had raised the issue early on in the legislative process.
“We would have better policy debates, and ultimately, better policy if these key public interest provisions were analyzed and discussed early,” she said. “It’s probably not good government if we’re only really grappling with the public’s right to information and meetings at the very end stages of legislative proposals.”
While the proposal limits the nonprofit’s discretion to hold private meetings, Tracy Rosenberg, advocacy director of Oakland Privacy, told CalMatters she hopes the discretion wouldn’t be abused.
“We would hope that when taxpayer money is involved, you know, the (open meetings laws) should just apply without all these special carve-outs,” she said.
Other proposals to block transparency loom
The infrastructure proposal is only one of many this year that would exempt state entities from the open meetings law or reduce their public disclosure requirements, according to a CalMatters analysis. Most of those measures cite concerns about releasing sensitive, investigative or proprietary information as rationale.
At least three proposals would completely shield various entities such as task forces, working groups and advisory committees from the state’s open meetings requirement. They’ve all cleared the Assembly and are being debated in Senate committees.

Another proposal green lit by the Assembly is AB1103 by Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward of San Diego. It would shield certain members of the Research Advisory Panel of California, a controlled substance study review group, from the open meetings law, and allow the group to continue meeting in private. Members of the group stopped meeting altogether in 2023 after being subject to open meetings requirements, arguing they could not publicly discuss studies without violating copyright and patent protections.
Additional measures aim to loosen public disclosure requirements and reduce the scope of records the state is required to release. One of them, AB 973 by GOP Assemblymember Josh Hoover of Folsom, would allow plastic manufacturers to ask CalRecycle to keep information they submit to the department private. Under the legislation, the department director could grant that request if they believe doing so “is not detrimental to the public interest.”
Two other measures, SB 495 by Sen. Ben Allen and AB 1339 by Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, would require insurers to report more information to the state but would keep it from public disclosure. 
And AB 1504, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat, would have subjected the California Massage Therapy Council, a nonprofit created by the state to certify massage therapists, to the California Public Records Act. 
Berman balked after the language drew fierce opposition from district attorneys and massage therapists, some of whom argued the requirements represent “government interference with the right of private parties” and would identify the council as a “quasi-public entity” 16 years after it was created. His current proposal merely “encourages” the council to make its information public.
“Despite the significant amendments, I still believe that greater transparency is essential for this Council to remain trusted and effective,” Berman said in a Monday hearing.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/041323-QUITO-VILLAGE-MHN-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627
,California,2025-07-02 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Homeless student counts in California are up. Some say that’s a good thing,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/07/homeless-students-california/,"In the latest state enrollment data released, California had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year.","In summary
In the latest state enrollment data released, California had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year. 


In Kern County, the first rule in counting homeless students is not saying “homeless.”
Instead, school staff use phrases like “struggling with stable housing” or “families in transition.” The approach seems to have worked: More families are sharing their housing status with their children’s schools, which means more students are getting services.
“There’s a lot of stigma attached to the word ‘homeless,’” said Curt Williams, director of homeless and foster youth services for the Kern County Office of Education. “When you remove that word, it all changes.”
Largely as a result of better identification methods, Kern County saw its homeless student population jump 10% last year, to 7,200. Those students received transportation to and from school, free school supplies, tutoring and other services intended to help them stay in school. For the purposes of this data, the definition of homelessness is broader than the state’s point in time count.
The trend is reflected statewide. In the latest state enrollment data released last month, California had 230,443 homeless students — a 9.3% increase from the previous year. Some of the increase is due to the state’s ongoing housing shortage, but most of the increase is because of better identification, advocates and school officials said.
Homeless students face numerous obstacles in school. They have higher rates of discipline and absenteeism, and fare worse academically. Last year, only 16% of homeless students met the state’s math standard, some of the lowest scores of any student group.
“Schools can’t solve homelessness, but they can ensure the students are safe in the classroom and getting the education they need to get out of homelessness,” said Barbara Duffield, executive director of Schoolhouse Connection, a national homeless youth advocacy group. “That starts with identifying the child who’s homeless.”
Challenges of counting homeless students
Under the federal McKinney-Vento Act, schools are required to count their homeless students throughout the school year and ensure they receive services. Homeless students also have the right to stay enrolled in their original school even if they move.
For many years, schools struggled to identify homeless students. Under state law, schools must distribute forms at the beginning of the school year asking families where they live — in their own homes, in motels, doubled-up with other families, in shelters, cars or outdoors. 

Some schools were less-than-diligent about collecting the form, or reassuring families understood the importance. Often, homeless families were reluctant to submit the form because they were afraid the school might contact a child welfare agency. Immigrant families sometimes feared the school might notify immigration authorities. And some families didn’t realize that sharing quarters with another family — by far the most common living situation among homeless families – is technically defined as homeless, at least under McKinney-Vento. 
A 2021 bill by former Assemblymember Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta in the San Fernando Valley, sought to fix that problem. The bill requires schools to train everyone who works with students — from bus drivers to cafeteria workers to teachers — on how to recognize potential signs of homelessness. That could include families who move frequently or don’t reply to school correspondence.
The bill seems to have helped. Last year, the state identified 21,000 more homeless students than it had the previous year, even as overall enrollment dropped.
Still, that’s probably an undercount, researchers said. The actual homeless student population is probably between 5% and10% of those students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, according to the National Center for Homeless Education. In California, that would be a shortfall of up to 138,713 students.
Influx of funding
Another boost for identifying homeless students came from the American Rescue Plan, the federal COVID-19 relief package. The plan included $800 million for schools to hire counselors or train existing staff to help homeless students. Nearly all schools in California received some money.
About 120 districts in California won grant money through the McKinney-Vento Act, which last year dispersed about $15.9 million in California to pay for things like rides to school, backpacks, staff and other services. Districts are chosen on a competitive basis; not all districts that apply receive funds.
But those funding sources are drying up. Most of the pandemic relief money has already been spent, and President Donald Trump’s recently approved budget does not include McKinney-Vento funding for 2026-27.
The cuts come at a time when advocates expect steep increases in the number of homeless families over the next few years, due in part to national policy changes. Republican budget proposals include cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other programs aimed at helping low-income families, while the immigration crackdown has left thousands of families afraid to seek assistance. For families living on tight budgets, those cuts could lead to a loss of housing.
And in California, the shortage of affordable housing continues to be a hurdle for low-income families. Even Kern County, which has traditionally been a less pricey option for families, has seen a spike in housing costs as more residents move there from Los Angeles. 
Joseph Bishop, an education professor at UCLA and co-author of a recent report on homeless students nationwide, said the loss of government funding will be devastating for homeless students. 
“California is the epicenter of the homeless student crisis, and we need targeted, dedicated support,” Bishop said. “Folks should be extremely alarmed right now. Will these kids be getting the education they need and deserve?” 
Better food, cleaner bathrooms
In Kern County, identification has only been one part of the effort to help homeless students thrive in school. Schools also try to pair them with tutors and mentors, give them school supplies and laundry tokens, and invite them to join a program called Student Voice Ambassadors. There, students can tour local colleges, learn leadership skills and explore career options. 
As part of the program, staff ask students what would make school more enticing — and then make sure the suggestions happen. At one school, students said they’d go to class if the bathrooms were cleaner. So staff improved the bathrooms. At another school, students wanted better food. They got it.
Williams credits the program with reducing absenteeism among homeless students. Two years ago, 45% of Kern County’s homeless students were chronically absent. Last year, the number dropped to 39% – still too high, he said, but a significant improvement.
“Without McKinney-Vento funds, the Student Voice Ambassador program would go away,” Williams said. “How will we keep it going? I don’t know.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/020223-T.-Griffin-Stege-Elementary-SK21-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

Church officials complained after several men on the grounds of two Inland Empire Catholic churches were detained by immigration enforcement officers.  


ICE arrests near two churches in San Bernardino County last month show how ramped up immigration enforcement is disturbing places that were once deemed protected.
On June 20 federal agents picked up a longtime parishioner of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Montclair on church property, according to the National Catholic Reporter. In a separate incident that day, agents chased several men onto the church parking lot of St. Adelaide parish in Highland. 
Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin disputed what she said were news reports that agents had entered the church hall. 
“The accusation that ICE entered a church to make an arrest are FALSE,” she stated in an email to CalMatters.  “ICE conducted a traffic stop on an illegal alien on June 20 in the general proximity of Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Montclair, California. The illegal alien chose to pull into the church parking lot. Officers then safely made the arrest.”
For almost a decade and a half, U.S. immigration officers steered clear of churches, complying with a directive by former President Barack Obama that limited immigration enforcement at sensitive locations, including schools, hospitals and places of worship. Former President Joe Biden maintained those guidelines to deter immigration action in areas that provide essential services.
On his inauguration day Jan. 20, President Donald Trump revoked that protection, stating that the Biden-era restrictions “thwart law enforcement in or near so-called ‘sensitive’ areas.” 
Catholic leaders have denounced ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics and protested that many detained immigrants are denied the right to plead their cases.
“Authorities are now seizing brothers and sisters indiscriminately, without respect for their right to due process and their dignity as children of God,” wrote Bishop Alberto Rojas, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino, in a letter to parishioners June 23.
John Andrews, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino, said the man detained at Our Lady of Lourdes is a longtime parishioner whose family is involved in the ministry. 
“There was no one present at Our Lady of Lourdes when he was taken into custody,” Andrews told CalMatters in an email. “He was doing some landscaping work there. He is in custody so there is no one who can really speak to what transpired in that apprehension.”
The men arrested at St. Adelaide Church didn’t appear to have a connection to the parish, Andrews said: “Neither the parish nor the diocese has any information about them, their whereabouts or whether or not they were arrested.”
Rojas stated in his letter that church leaders respect law enforcement efforts to keep communities safe from violent criminals, but raiding homes, workplaces and churches creates fear and confusion: “It is not of the Gospel of Jesus Christ — which guides us in all that we do.”
He asked elected leaders to “reconsider and cease these tactics immediately, in favor of an approach that respects human rights and human dignity and builds toward a more lasting, comprehensive reform of our immigration system.”
The Catholic Church has been increasingly vocal on the plight of immigrants and refugees in recent years. The late Pope Francis traveled to Sicily to meet with immigrants from Libya on his first pastoral visit outside Rome and later rescued 12 Syrians from a refugee camp in Greece. As Trump took office in January, Pope Francis denounced his mass deportation plans as “a disgrace.”
On June 20, the day of the Inland Empire church arrests, also World Refugee Day, Michael Pham, the newly appointed bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, joined a group of clergy to witness immigration proceedings at the federal building in San Diego. 
Pham came to the U.S. as a refugee from Vietnam in 1981. He told reporters that he prayed for “wisdom and insight to help our poor brothers … through the crises in their lives.”

The raids also are beginning to draw criticism from some California Republican lawmakers. Six signed a June 27 letter calling for more moderate immigration action, arguing that raids are hurting communities and businesses.
The lawmakers — including state Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, a Redlands Republican — endorsed the letter by Senator Suzette Martinez Valladares, a Santa Clarita Republican, asking Trump to “focus deportations on criminals” and modernize immigration policies.
While they support immigration enforcement against violent criminals, they said, immigrants without criminal records are being swept up in raids, “creating widespread fear.”
ICE workplace raids at farms, construction sites, restaurants and hotels, “are harming the communities we represent and the businesses that employ our constituents,” the letter states.

It's moving toward paying them minimum wage for their work in emergencies.,"In summary
California sent incarcerated firefighters to battle blazes in Los Angeles this year. It’s moving toward paying them minimum wage for their work in emergencies.


In a historic policy change, California is moving to pay incarcerated firefighters the federal minimum wage during active fires. 
The wage increase, funded through the new state budget, follows years of advocacy to improve pay and working conditions for incarcerated labor. That effort took on a new urgency after hundreds of incarcerated firefighters were deployed to battle deadly wildfires that hit Los Angeles in January. 
Incarcerated firefighters currently earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. During active emergencies, Cal Fire compensates them an additional $1 per hour. 
That appears to be changing. Gov. Gavin Newsom last week signed a new state budget with $10 million to pay incarcerated firefighters $7.25 an hour when they’re on a fire. It will take effect Jan. 1 as long as the Legislature passes a bill that would mandate the policy.
“It’s the right thing to do and it’s long overdue,” said Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat from Culver City who authored the bill that would raise incarcerated firefighter pay. “It feels really beautiful and life changing for folks who have sacrificed to save others during their time being held accountable for whatever harms they may have caused in their past.” 
Bryan initially set out to raise wages for incarcerated firefighters to $19 per hour, but settled on the federal minimum wage after budget negotiations. The bill, which received bipartisan support from nearly two dozen lawmakers, was opposed by the California State Sheriffs’ Association over concerns of its potential fiscal impact on counties. 
“To have a bipartisan moment where we’re dignifying incarcerated labor with a federal minimum wage – I think that is the best of who we are,” said Bryan. “My colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on this particular effort, are demonstrating what it really means to be Californian.”
Bryan introduced the bill after voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have ended forced labor in prisons and jails. California’s incarcerated firefighters have long provided critical support to state, local and federal government agencies in responding to various emergencies, including wildfires and floods. 
Over 1,800 incarcerated firefighters live year-round in minimum-security conservation camps, also known as “fire camps,” located across 25 counties in California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Those numbers have dwindled in recent years due to a declining prison population. 
The wage increase is an acknowledgment to the people fighting the fires, said Katie Dixon, policy and campaign coordinator for the organization California Coalition for Women Prisoners, which supported Bryan’s bill. 
“I feel like this is a statement of value – in saying: we value you, we honor you, we see you,” said Dixon. 
Dixon dreamed of becoming a firefighter after spending two years on a hand crew while she was incarcerated. But despite her experience fighting hundreds of fires, she found that the career path was not available to her when she was released from prison in 2012 due to her criminal record. 
“It felt like a dream deferred. A dream that’s been cut off due to systemic policies designed to keep people like me — Black people — out of certain professions,” said Dixon. “Deep down inside, I’m supposed to be a battalion chief.”
Both state and federal legislation have been introduced this year to try and shore up the pipeline for incarcerated people to land in firefighting careers once they’ve been released. 
U.S. Reps. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Judy Chu, both from California, introduced a bill that would establish national protections for incarcerated firefighters, including a uniform framework to clear their records that would ease the barriers to employment. 
“As we are seeing departments contract, as we are seeing that it is harder to recruit and retain firefighters, why would you miss an opportunity like this to connect a pipeline that is trained right into municipalities that need more firefighters?” said Kamlager-Dove. “At the end of the day, it’s jobs and economic stability that help all of us.”

(Courtesy photo)Salt Lake City’s Ballpark neighborhood likely won’t completely lose its namesake, a final design for Smith’s Ballpark unveiled Tuesday shows. 
The 13.5-acre space left behind by the minor league team Salt Lake Bees is set to preserve its west bleachers, with a 3,700 seating capacity, as well as part of the field and other elements at the stadium’s main entrance.
The vision, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said, is a place that accommodates year-round activities, including different sports, concerts and festivals, but is also a more accessible spot preserving “a lot of the green space that the kids in this neighborhood have never touched.”

“There’s really good bones in this part of the stadium, the steel structure is actually much more sound than we expected it to be before the engineering assessment was done,” Mendenhall said. “So we’re in a good space to preserve this section of the stadium, which is also cost savings to the public when we take it out to it.”
The Salt Lake City Community Reinvestment Agency will review the design and hear public comment on the proposal next Tuesday at 2 p.m. A final decision is expected in late summer, the agency said in a release.
All options are on the table for Smith’s Ballpark, including demolition

The goal, according to the design plan by the firm Perkins&Will, is to bring new life to what has been a city landmark for over 75 years, with walkable streets and prime views of the Wasatch Range.
The spot is designed to host a new fire station, a library branch and housing units with home-ownership options. Also a linear park of about 0.7 acres along 1300 South, as soon as work to bring the Red Butte, Emigration and Parley creeks back to the surface. 
Salt Lake City Council member Darin Mano, who represents the area, said that after all plans are completed, he imagines the neighborhood looking a lot like “a little second downtown, or another Sugar House-type of place.”
“Another place where you can go and have great food, grab a drink, work here and live here,” Mano said. 
The city has other big plans that could turn the neighborhood into a destination, as well.

“Festival street activation has long been part of our station area plan for the Ballpark neighborhood that is also incorporated here,” Mendenhall said, “which means that West Temple becomes a tree-lined accessible space for markets, different little festivals that can happen, street-facing restaurants, bars and shops.” 
There’s also a proposal for a hotel and ground-floor retail along the edges of the development, where the city hopes to accommodate local businesses.
Phase 1 of the development will focus on the partial demolition of the ballpark, while hosting some interim activities and community events on streets and parking lots, in addition to building multi-family housing on the northern surface parking block at the corner of West Temple and Paxton Avenue, and some lower-density units along West Temple. 



Let us know what you think...


 


There isn’t a set timeline on when the full project will be completed. But, the city may issue a development request for proposals late this year. And demolition won’t start for probably a year or two. 
With offering different types of housing being one of the community’s priorities, Mano said that the city will watch for developers that can deliver different housing alternatives.
“Some of the things that we’re going to be looking for is who feels confident that they can deliver market rate for sale, family-sized housing, mixed in with what we all know we need, which is affordable housing,” he said
The final design comes after the Ballpark NEXT Design Competition launched after the Bees announced their move to South Jordan in January 2023. That effort highlighted professional, resident and student projects, including a hub for small businesses and a women’s multi-sport venue. Ultimately those ideas helped build the design, Mendenhall said.

Presenters and advocates warned last week that Medicaid cuts in the tax-and-spending bill that passed Congress Tuesday could devastate health care in Alabama's Black Belt. (Will McClelland/Alabama Reflector)Researchers and advocates warned the public in a media briefing last week that proposed Medicaid cuts in the massive tax-and-spending package that passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday would devastate a region that relies heavily on the federal program.
In 2023, 21 of the 24 counties that comprise the region had some of the highest percentages of Medicaid enrollees in Alabama.
“About 28% of people living in the average Black Belt county are covered by Medicaid, compared to 20% in non-Black Belt counties and  23% overall in the state,” said Garrett Till, a graduate research assistant with the Education Policy Center at the University of Alabama.

The bill that passed the Senate on Tuesday includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income individuals. In Alabama, most of those covered by Medicaid are children, the elderly and those with disabilities. Non-disabled adults only qualify for Medicaid if they have qualifying children and make 18% of the poverty line or less — about $2,817 a year for an individual and $4,797 for a family of three.
According to the report published by the Education Policy Center, 38% of Perry County’s residents were enrolled in Medicaid in 2023, the highest in the state. The Black Belt county with the lowest percentage of Medicaid enrollees was Lamar County at 20%, the only one that is equivalent to the average of a non-Black Belt counties.
“What is in the air is not spelling out well for rural situations here,” Till said. “As we see with all these counties in the Black Belt, which are going to be predominantly, if not all rural counties, are going to be hurting the most.”
About 38% of Medicaid dollars are allocated to hospitals, according to a report from the Alabama Medicaid Agency. Rural areas, like much of the Black Belt, struggle with retaining hospitals after several medical centers have already closed in the past several years.
According to the report from the Education Policy Center, 10 have already closed since 2005. Further cuts, the report says, will endanger the future viability of those that continue to operate. The report states that 27 are reportedly in danger of closing their doors, while 19 are at immediate risk of closing.
Presenters during the briefing spoke of the Medicaid provision that allows the state to impose a tax on providers that is then used to help pay for the state’s portion of the cost it shares with the federal government.  The budget proposal places a cap on the provider tax, which would limit the amount the state can generate to pay for its share of the federal program.
That shortfall becomes an additional cost that Alabama must bear on behalf of residents who are eligible for the program.
Till said the freeze would “just in turn is going to kick more and more people off Medicaid, period.”
Areas in the Black Belt have some of the worst outcomes for diabetes, heart disease and infant mortality. Twelve counties in Alabama with the highest rates of diabetes are located in the Black Belt. In Bullock County, about 20% of the residents suffer from the disease.
Medicaid reimbursements for physicians and other medical providers also remains low.
“The issue is if a provider, a new doctor, comes to Thomasville, Alabama, because of that lowest cost reimbursement per claim per patient in Alabama being the lowest in the nation, guess what, they go to Georgia or they go to North Carolina or they go to Arizona, or they go to another state,” said Sheldon Day, mayor of Thomasville, which is in the Black Belt. “They can see the same 40, 30, 40, 50 patients a day in their practice and probably make $100,000 more a year for the same work.”
Presenters provided several policy recommendations to address the issue. Among them is to oppose the reductions to Medicaid and the freeze to the tax on providers. They also urged communities to invest in health literacy and community initiatives along with finding solutions to the provider shortage.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

The image was captured by the Research Technologies Branch of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana. Alaska officials have now recorded a death from disseminated gonococcal infection, a rare complication of the sexually transmitted disease. (Image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)An Alaska woman has died from a severe complication of gonorrhea that is rare but has increased in frequency in the state, health officials reported.
The woman, in her 50s, had disseminated gonococcal infection, or DGI, in which the bacteria that causes gonorrhea spreads to bodily organs, according to a bulletin issued Monday by the Department of Health’s epidemiology section. She arrived in the spring at the emergency department of an Anchorage hospital with septic shock and heart failure, and the DGI diagnosis followed before she died, the bulletin said.
She was one of eight Alaskans identified with DGI between January and May of this year, according to the bulletin. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 59. Five were women. All were treated in Anchorage, according to the bulletin.
The woman who died had been treated twice in the prior six months for opioid abuse, but there was no record of her being tested for gonorrhea in the year prior to her death, the bulletin said.
While gonorrhea is curable with antibiotics, some infected people may have no symptoms and therefore miss testing and treatment, said Dr. Liz Ohlsen, a staff physician with the Alaska Department of Health who authored the bulletin.
That puts those people at risk that their untreated gonorrhea will develop into much more serious DGI, she said.
As state health officials track DGI cases, there are concerns that a particular strain may be circulating in Alaska that is less likely to cause symptoms, Ohlsen said.
“We think the most likely explanation for the rise in DGI cases is that more people with gonorrhea are not getting tested and treated in a timely manner. Asymptomatic infections are thought to pose a greater risk of persistent untreated infection because people are less likely to have sought care,” she said by email.
Through a public-education effort, the department is urging Alaskans with multiple sexual partners — or anyone who has a partner with multiple partners — to be tested for gonorrhea regularly, every three to six months, she said.
Alaska has consistently had among the nation’s highest rates of gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections. Last year, the state recorded a spike in DGI, with 27 cases reported in 2024 after having had three in 2022 and eight in 2023. That represented 1.3% of total reported gonorrhea cases in 2024, a much higher percentage than what has been reported in earlier years.
In cases of DGI, the gonorrheal infections that are normally confined to mucus membranes of the genital, rectal or mouth areas spread internally. Potential effects include joint or tendon problems, heart infections and meningitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.
“Deaths from disseminated gonococcal infection are rare, but DGI can cause serious complications like heart problems that can lead to death. The more cases of DGI we have, the more likely it is that some people have serious complications or death as a result,” Ohlsen said.
Statistics about DGI and DGI-related deaths are difficult to pinpoint, however.
While diagnosed cases of gonorrhea are required to be reported in Alaska, as in other states, cases of DGI are not, Ohlsen said.
There are a few available studies that give some information about DGI occurrences.
One study from California found that from mid-2020 to mid-2021, 0.24% of reported gonorrhea cases had developed into DGI.
Another study of cases in several Western U.S. states found that of 274 confirmed and probable DGI cases reported between 2020 and 2022 to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.2% of the patients died.

On his 21st birthday, Medgar Evers and six other World War II veterans, including his brother, Charles, tried to vote in Decatur, Mississippi, only to be turned away by an armed White mob.

,California,2025-07-02 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers finally achieve ‘holy grail’ reform of state’s key environmental law,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/lawmakers-finally-reform-environmental-law/,"The social and economic costs of leaving CEQA intact became too high. With Gavin Newsom nearing the end of his governorship, he decided to confront the issue squarely.","Jerry Brown once described reform of the California Environmental Quality Act as “the lord’s work” but he, like other recent governors, was not willing to invest enough political capital to change it.
Simply put, significantly altering CEQA, which then-Gov. Ronald Reagan signed more than a half-century ago, would require confronting two powerful interest groups: environmental organizations and labor unions, which have weaponized the law to achieve their goals.
Brown made one stab at compelling the Legislature to alter CEQA in 2016, but otherwise left it to his successor, Gavin Newsom.
For six years, Newsom echoed the attitudes of his predecessors, critical of CEQA’s misuse to block housing and other much-needed projects, or compel developers to hire unionized labor or jump through other hoops, but unwilling to confront it head-on.
Instead, he and the Legislature nibbled at the edges of the law and gave specific projects, such as sports arenas, exemptions.
Finally, however, the social and economic costs of leaving CEQA intact became too high. The state’s critical shortage of housing continued despite innumerable policy declarations aimed at spurring investment. It became downright embarrassing that a politically dominant Democratic Party pledged to socioeconomic equity was unable to deliver on promises to make housing more abundant and affordable.
California starred in a New York Times video that chastised blue states for failing to live up to their stated principles and in a recent book, “Abundance,” about the nation’s chronic inability to deliver much-needed projects due to regulatory overkill, such as CEQA.
This year, with Newsom nearing the end of his governorship and appearing to cast his eyes toward a presidential campaign, the governor decided to confront the CEQA issue squarely. He endorsed two bills that would impose limits on the law’s reach and, in the end, threatening to block the entire state budget if they weren’t placed on his desk.
On Monday, the last day of the fiscal year, the Legislature passed Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131 with last-minute changes to dampen opposition from construction unions. Newsom quickly signed them.
“We needed to go bold and big on this holy grail reform,” Newsom said at a hastily staged signing ceremony.
Essentially, the legislation exempts virtually all infill housing projects from CEQA’s provisions, making it more difficult for opponents of high-density housing projects, known as NIMBYs, to block approval.
Such projects, particularly those aimed at low- and moderate-income families, have been the most difficult to gain approval, due largely to opposition in upscale communities dominated by single-family homeowners.
“When you are building housing in an existing community, that is environmentally beneficial, it is climate friendly, that is not something that should be subjected to potentially endless CEQA challenges and lawsuits,” Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who authored SB 131, told senators before they passed the measure.
Wiener and Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who carried AB 130, have been the Capitol’s two most aggressive advocates of pro-housing legislation.

The remaining question, of course, is whether the two new laws, which go into effect immediately, will have a discernible impact on the state’s housing shortage. CEQA is just one factor of many determining whether proposed projects proceed or die. Those who oppose high-density housing in their neighborhoods will not just roll over.
Ironically, as the Legislature was passing the two new laws on Monday, The Atlantic was publishing a lengthy article entitled “The Whole Country Is Starting to Look Like California,” that describes how red tape and local opposition are adversely affecting housing development in red states such as Texas and Florida, which had been viewed as developer paradises.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/052423-Santa-Monica-Construction-ZS-CM-21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 08:00:55.282100

And then someone comes along and does what 18-year-old Jake Moffitt of Ripley did recently in the State Amateur Championship played at Grand Bear Golf Club in Saucier. Hold on to your visors, folks: Playing on the difficult Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course measuring over 7,100 yards, Moffitt, a Southern Miss signee, shot 21-under par for 72 holes and won by a whopping 10 shots over runner-up Jackson Cook of West Point. Cook, a two-time Mississippi junior champion, has signed to play at Mississippi State.

Rick Cleveland
Both Moffitt’s 72-hole score and his victory margin set State Am records. Moffitt’s final round of nine-under-par 63 – 10 pars, 7 birdies and an eagle – was just one off the Grand Bear course record of 62, shot by 10-time PGA TOUR champion Steve Elkington in a Champions Tour tournament in 2022. 
When the PGA TOUR held its first round of tour qualifying at Grand Bear two years ago, the winning 72-hole score was 280 – 13 shots worse than what young Moffitt just shot.
Says accomplished, 42-year-old Belden amateur Joe Deraney, who shot 3-under at Grand Bear and finished in a tie for eighth place, “Twenty-one under par on that golf course is an amazing score. He lapped the field. And I can’t tell you how good that final round 63 was. To shoot that score under fire when he held the lead and all the pressure was on him is really, really something.”
Yes, it is, and it qualifies Moffitt to play in the U.S. Amateur Championship at the famed Olympic Club’s Lake Course in San Francisco. That’s a far cry from his hometown course, a nine hole track called Pine Hill Country Club where Moffitt says he plays “95 percent of my golf.” And it’s not bad for a country kid, with a decided Hill Country accent, who took up the game of golf five years ago at age 13 when he was looking for something he could do for fun during the Covid pandemic.

Jake Moffitt tees off.
Before that, Moffitt played all the team sports, especially baseball where his usual position was third baseman. Once he began to play golf, he was hooked. And he got better fast, breaking 80 within a few months of beginning to practice and play regularly.
“What I love most about golf is that it’s an individual sport,” he said. “It’s all on you and you are depending on you, yourself, the whole time. It’s a game where you are always trying to reach perfection but you never can. Every shot, every practice shot, the goal is to get better. I like that.”
Moffitt led Ripley to three Class 4A state championships and won the individual championship himself all three times. Earlier this year, he won the Oxford Country Club Invitational, making birdies on the last three holes to come from behind and beat Deraney.
In April, he qualified for a PGA Korn Ferry Tour event, the Club Car Championship in Savannah, Ga. So of course, he shot 66 and made the field and missed a week of school.
He shot 78 and 76 and missed the cut but says, “It was about as much fun as I have ever had on a golf course.”
Southern Miss golf coach Eddie Brescher, who has finished as runner-up in the State Am three times himself, began recruiting Moffitt three years ago, and Moffitt committed over a year ago.
“We could see his potential three years ago, and he’s gotten a lot better since then,” Brescher said. “We are trying to do in golf what Southern Miss has done in baseball and that’s compete on a national basis. We’re headed in the right direction and signing Jake is a big step. His game has no weaknesses and he’s only going to get better. He’s a humble country boy who doesn’t mind hard work and can really, really play this  game.”
The U.S. Amateur will be played August 11-17 at Olympic, which has hosted so much golf history, including the 1966 U.S. Open when Arnold Palmer lost a seven-shot lead and then the a playoff to Billy Casper. Moffitt says he knows little about Olympic but does know the rough will be high and the greens will be lightning fast, as is the case for all USGA events.
Says the 18-year-old from rural northeast Mississippi, “I can’t wait.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/30142100/State-Am-champion-Jake-Moffitt-.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

Jones said in an interview Tuesday that he endorsed Alex Braswell, a 30-year-old American Sign language interpreter, in the House District 11 contest because she impressed him with her knowledge of issues affecting Alabamians.
“I don’t know how many candidates that I’ve ever talked to that had done their homework about what’s going on in the state, what’s going on in the district. She has,” he said. “She’s the first woman nominee in that district. I think that’s important too.”

House District 11 has been solidly Republican in the past, but Jones said that endorsing candidates in special elections is important. 
“Those that don’t particularly care for me or Democrats, they’re either going to ignore it, or it’s going to drive them to the polls to vote for her opponent,” he said.
Braswell said she hopes the endorsement will bring more attention to Democrats in Alabama.
“If people should feel inclined to donate because I have Doug Jones’ endorsement, it’s more than welcome. But that was not the goal,” she said. “It’s always been to bring more attention to the Cullman County Democratic Party.”
Braswell has raised over $7,000, according to campaign finance records. Her opponent, Heath Allbright, has raised over $105,000, according to campaign finance records. 
Jones plans to hold a town hall on July 29 for Braswell in the district prior to the general election on Aug. 26, which he hopes will attract people from all parties. Braswell said the venue is not reserved yet, but the event will begin at 6 p.m. Jones said the campaign event will also be an opportunity for his wife, Louise, who is from Cullman County, to go home.
“I’m hoping that whatever people ultimately decide, that the endorsement of a former United States senator will at least get people looking at her platform, what she stands for, and listen to her,” he said. “I think that’s the most important piece of this, is just to bring this election to the attention of voters, regardless of how they end up voting.”
Braswell announced the endorsement on her Facebook page Monday morning and said in an interview Tuesday that Jones has been a role model for her.
“I think it will help us complete our overall goal to win this election,” Braswell said. 
Jones, who served in the U.S. Senate from 2018 to 2021, said he had not made a concrete decision on his political future, including running for Alabama’s governor in 2026. 
“This is about the candidates that are running in this special election. I’ve told people right now, my wife and I are staying in this fight,” he said. “I think that the direction the state’s headed, I’m concerned about it. I’m concerned about where the country is headed, and so we’re going to still stay active and vocal. What that means going forward, we haven’t fully developed yet.”
While Braswell is the only candidate endorsed by Jones right now, he said he would listen to any candidate that called him. There are currently three House special elections in Alabama: District 11, 12 and 63. There will soon be one in District 13 following former Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, being elected to the state Senate in District 5. There is one Democratic candidate in each of the special elections.

Kennedy Jr. testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C.. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Maryland was one of 19 states that won a preliminary injunction Tuesday from a federal judge in Rhode Island blocking the Department of Health and Human Services’ plan to lay off thousands of workers and dismantle several agency programs.
The court victory came the same day that Maryland joined two other lawsuits by Democratic-led states against the Trump administration: One to prevent HHS from providing the Department of Homeland Security with “unfettered access” to personal health data of Medicaid recipients and another to reverse Department of Education cuts to mental health programs.
Tuesday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge Melissa R. DuBose blocked HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s move on March 27 to lay off 10,000 employees and close or consolidate dozens of agcncy offices as part of his Make America Healthy Again program. DuBose, ruling in lawsuit filed May 5 by 19 states and the Distrit of Columbia, said the moves caused “irreparable harms.”
“Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,” DuBose wrote.
When termination notices went out on April 1, the suit says, “employees were immediately expelled from their work email, laptops, and offices, work across the vast and complicated Department came to a sudden halt. Throughout HHS, critical offices were left unable to perform statutory functions.”
“HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,” the judge’s order said.
The order also blocked plans to terminate employees at and restructure the offices of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Center for Tobacco Products, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
“Marylanders count on HHS programs every single day, from substance abuse treatment programs that help families in crisis to maternal health initiatives that ensure safe pregnancies and births,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement about the injuction. “Today’s court ruling ensures these life-saving programs remain intact while we continue our legal fight to protect the health and well being of Marylanders and their families.”
Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) has been leading congressional critic of Kennedy’s, and the Maryland Democratic Party continues to urge residents and others to demand his resignation.
Shared personal data
Brown and 19 other attorneys general also filed suit Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against HHS’ mass transfer of personal information, which the states claim violates federal law.
A summary of the lawsuit, a copy of which was not available Tuesday eveninig, claims states learned about the agency’s plan doing through news reports on June 13 that said the move was part of a Trump administration plan to create a sweeping database for “mass deportations” and other large-scale immigration enforcement purposes.
Statements from the attorneys general said HHS claimed it gave the personal data to Homeland Security “to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.” Medicaid is a shared federal-state program to provide health care to low-income individuals and those in underserved populations, including children, pregnant women, people with disabilities and seniors.
The attorneys general said Congress created Medicaid for the benefit of all residents of the country, regardless of immigration status.
“Immigrants should not be forced to choose between protecting their families and seeking medical care they are legally entitled to receive,” Brown said. “We are acting to defend the privacy of all Marylanders and ensure hospitals aren’t left to bear the burden when patients delay care out of fear.”
HHS spokesperson Andre Nixon said in an email Tuesday afternoon the agency acted within its legal authority and in full compliance with “all applicable laws” through the agency’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Mehmet Oz, a physician who appeared frequently on the “Oprah Winfrey Show” and his own television show before he entered politics, is the administrator for the centers.
“Under the leadership of Dr. Oz, CMS is aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants – that includes California,” Nixon said.
“This oversight effort – supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS – is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse,” the staetment said. “We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars – we are restoring credibility to one of America’s most vital programs. The American people deserve accountability. HHS is delivering it.”
Education suit
On Monday, Maryland joined 15 other states in a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in the state of Washington to challenge $1 billion in cuts announced in April by the U.S. Department of Education toward mental health programs.
More specifically, the department said cuts targeted contracts to hire more mental health professionals and school counselors, but focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.
The suit says the contract terminations are “unlawful” under the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law that requires that federal agencies proposing new rules and regulations must first publish them in the Federal Register to allow for public comment.
Congress authorized the department to provide an addiitional $100 million in fiscal years 2022 to 2026 through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, in the wake of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, when a teenager shot and killed 19 elementary school students and two adults at Robb Elementary School.
Brown said in a statement the cuts would affect programs such as nearly $2.5 million already approved toward a school-based mental health fellowship program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. In the last two years, about 67 students have come through the program and worked at 50 public schools “where the need for mental health resources is acute.”
“Established to prevent school violence like mass-shootings, these programs are critical to ensuring the well-being of our students,” his statement said. “We will not allow the Trump administration to threaten our children’s safety or jeopardize Maryland’s programs that support them and set them up for success.”
He called the termination of the grants supporting schools counselors and other mental health professionals “a cruel and reckless action that puts our students at increased risk of suicide and self-harm.”
The suit, filed against Education Secretary Linda McMahon, said the department announced in April it would discontinue the program and “recompete” the funds based on new priorities it identified as “merit, fairness and excellence in education.”
A representative with the department did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

House leaders have said they want to have the bill to President Donald Trump by Friday, but Maryland lawmakers are predicting tough sledding -- Democrats because it cuts too deep, the sole Republican because it doesn't cut enough. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Maryland’s House members slammed the Senate-passed budget bill Tuesday and predicted tough sledding for the measure when it comes back to the House — Democrats because it cuts too much and the state’s sole Republican because it doesn’t cut enough.
“I’m heartbroken – not just because of what this bill does, but because of who it leaves behind,” Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) said in a statement.
“The numbers are staggering!” McClain-Delaney wrote. “To support this bill would be to betray the 1.5 million Maryland residents who rely on Medicaid, which includes 50% of Maryland’s children.”
Medicaid cuts were a prime concern for Democrats among the items in the 1,000-page budget reconciliation bill, which also makes deep cuts to SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and to schools, among other social program cuts.
At the same time, the bill increases defense and Homeland Security spending and makes permanent tax cuts enacted in Trump’s first term that were set to expire at the end of this year. Democrats say those tax cuts benefit the wealthy more than working-class taxpayers.
The Congressional Budget Office released a report Sunday that said the combination of tax cuts and higher spending in the Senate version of the bill could add $3.25 trillion to the federal deficit — a number that is bringing pushback from fiscal hawks in the House.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. But in an interview with Fox News, he said the Senate bill “is not ready for prime-time.”
US Senate narrowly passes GOP megabill after overnight session, sends it to House

“This is not going to sail through the House,” Harris said. “We’re going to have to negotiate one more time, and that’s just appropriate. That’s the way the legislative process works, and the way it should work on a bill of this size.
Time for lawmakers to negotiate is running out, as President Donald Trump has been pushing to have the bill he calls the One Big, Beautiful Bill on his desk by July Fourth.
But there’s little wiggle room in either the House or Senate on the bill, which Democrats almost universally loathe and Republicans are divided between those in swing districts who worry deep program cuts will alienate some voters and budget hardliners who see a continually growing deficit.
The bill passed the Senate 51-50 Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote after three Republicans joined 47 Democrats and independents in opposition. That vote followed a round-the-clock marathon of dealing and voting over the weekend.
House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La) faces a similary slim majority, and can only afford to lose three GOP member if he hopes to get the bill to the president intact by Friday.
Harris said that may not happen.
The first test comes Wednesday, when the House is scheduled to take a procedural vote on the Senate version of the bill. Harris has said he will vote against advancing the bill on the procedural vote, and he expects to be joined by other House Freedom Caucus members.
“I don’t think the votes are there, just like they weren’t in the Senate initially, until some concessions were made,” Harris told Fox Tuesday. “I believe that the rule vote will not pass tomorrow morning, and then the speaker is going to have to decide how he gets this back into the … House framework.”
Harris told the network he thinks it will take “couple of days” to reach a compromise with the Senate. He sidestepped questions about his support for the Senate bill saying only that he was against the procedural vote.
Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said Harris should worry about the cuts in the underlying bill — and not because they don’t cut deep enough. Harris’ rural Eastern Shore district is one of the most Medicaid-dependent in the state, Raskin notes.
Four counties in Harris’ 1st District — Caroline, Dorchester, Somerset and Wicomico — all have enrollment rates above the state’s average of 19.8%, according to a study by the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. Somerset, where 25.7% are enrolled in Medicaid, is second only to Baltimore City’s 29.7%, according to the report.

Raskin also said the cost of the bill should be a gut-check for fiscal conservatives.
“This is really a moment of truth for Andy Harris and others in the Freedom Caucus. Are they just interested in going along with all of Donald Trump’s authoritarian moves. Or do they really care about reducing the debt and the deficit?” he said. “If they vote for this, they can never mention the word debt or deficit again, because this is the single most calamitous contribution to the federal debt in in our lifetime.”
For Raskin, Medicatd funding is the primary concern. The Senate bill cuts $1 trillion in Medicaid funding over a decade. Nationally, that means nearly 12 million people would lose their coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Maryland receives about $8.5 billion annually in Medicaid. Raskin said the Senate cuts would cost the state about $1 billion in Medicaid funding, pusing roughly 245,000 people off the rolls — a number Raskin said included Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and some residents who have insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
“Essentially, our people face having their health coverage stripped away from them at a time when the state is already reeling from federal policies,” said Raskin, who called the bill “a chainsaw massacre approach to health care.”
He said that approach is unwarranted, given the fact that it will add to the national debt rather than reduce it.
“I just don’t see the logic of doing this,” he said, “We’re undermining the health care of our own people and the well being of our own people, while we’re piling more than $3 trillion of new debt onto our children and grandchildren, and it’s all to pay for just a drunken tax break for people who don’t need it.”

McClain-Delaney said one family in nine in her Western Maryland district relies on SNAP, or food stamps, and nearly one in seven residents, including a third of children in the district, rely on Medicaid, she wrote.
“Balancing the budget shouldn’t come at their expense,” McClain Delaney wrote. “It’s not just bad policy, it’s a failure of compassion.”
As the Senate was voting to pass the bill Tuesday, Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd) was already sounding the alarm of how cuts to food assistance could affect some 20,000 families in his district.
“This bill … it is big, but it is not beautiful. It is cruel and it would take food out of the mouths of hungry kids,” he said Tuesday at an event at Cockeysville Library to celebrate the launch of a new summer meals site where lower-income families and their kids can pick up a free lunch.
“Expansions like the one we’re celebrating today … could disappear overnight,” he warned. Summer meal assistance programs implemented by the state often use federal funding to support operations.
Olszewski later told reporters that with Maryland’s tight fiscal outlook, the state would struggle to fill any missing dollars cut that are currently funding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“I think Maryland would be very hard pressed to find ways to fill the gap for these cuts,” he said. “We’re talking hundreds of billions of dollars of cuts in just food support alone – not mentioning the massive cuts to Medicaid and health coverage … Programs like today that we announced here at this library are unlikely to continue without funding.”
Raskin holds out hope that the bill will “go back to ground zero” once it returns to the House. He said moderate Republicans from districts in California, New Jersey and New York and conservative Republicans including those in the Freedom Caucus have reasons — albeit different ones — to vote against the bill.

(Photo by Jerry Glaser/Customs and Border Protection)State, federal and local officials who fought for years to bring the new FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County said Tuesday the fight is not over, after the surprise Trump administration announcement that the agency will stay downtown.
The FBI will move into existing space at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, just a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the current dilapidated headquarters in the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building, according to a statement from the FBI and the General Services Administration.
“Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.
The move reverses a 2023 GSA decision that identified a site near the Greenbelt Metro for the new headquarters, following years of study and of competition between Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions to land the site.
Gov. Wes Moore (D), Prince Georges’ County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D) and almost all of the state’s congressional delegation — calling themselves Team Maryland — insisted Tuesday  that Greenbelt is still the better site.

“Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities. That’s why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have,” the Team Maryland statement said.
The agency has been seeking new headquarters for years to replace the J. Edgar Hoover Building, a brutalist facility that is cramped, has leaks and pieces of concrete occasionally falling onto the street below.
In November 2023, the GSA picked Greenbelt over another site in Prince George’s County, Landover, and over a site in Springfield, Virginia.
Virginia representatives charged that the selection of Maryland was flawed after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process. But the report never stated there was a problem with the Greenbelt site itself.
President Donald Trump has never been a fan of moving the FBI out of the District. He tried to cancel it in his first term and in March of this year, less that two months after returning to office, he said he would not let the agency move “three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state.” He quickly said the state’s political leanings had no bearing on his decision, but never corrected the fact that Greenbelt is about 16 miles by car from the current headquarters.
Patel has talked in recent months about relocating headquarters staff to other parts of the country, but Tuesday’s announcement seems to have put that talk on hold.
GSA Public Buildings Service Commissioner Michael Peters said in a statement that move to the Reagan building avoids more than $300 million in deferred maintenance cost the current FBI headquarters.
“We are proud to partner with Director Patel to drive efficiency and improve the quality of space for a productive workforce in service to national security and taxpayers,” Peters said.
According to its website, the Reagan Building is home to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Until recently, it was also home to the U.S. Agency on International Developement, before that agency was gutted by the Trump administration and closed as an independent agency effective Tuesday, presumably freeing up space in the building.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the building also has 22 event spaces to host weddings and events. Plans are scheduled for two events Wednesday, and a concert series on a plaza starts Monday and continues through September.
Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the Greenbelt site, called Tuesday’s decision “very interesting.”
“That [Ronald Reagan] building is a very open building. I’ve gone there for private events and conferences,” Williams, who chairs the county’s delegation in the House of Delegate, said in an interview.
“I still maintain that the Greenbelt site is the better location for the relocation of the FBI. It’s disappointing to hear the administration trying to undermine what was already done through the official GSA process,” she said.
“Congress has already appropriated funds for the purpose of the construction of the new FBI headquarters in Maryland. Now the administration’s attempting to redirect those funds really undermines congressional intent,” Williams said, echoing arguments of Team Maryland.
Williams and her two Democratic District 22 colleagues – Dels. Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez – sponsored legislation that went into effect Tuesday directing the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/28785424127_e75ffb3705_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 09:03:55.055627

Still, advocates say this year’s legislative session made “substantial progress” advancing the well-being of children.
“We see now more than ever a context where money is leading decisions,” said Tara Raines, the deputy director of the Children’s Advocacy Alliance, which on Tuesday held a virtual panel to discuss the 2025 Legislative Session.
“We want to make sure that folks who don’t have the resources, like children in particular, who can’t vote, can’t write contributions and give contributions and donations, that they have a voice,” Raines added.
This year’s session brought major disappointments, like the veto of a bill to require some businesses to offer paid family and medical leave, but also some under-the-radar triumphs, like the capping of child welfare caseloads, that advocates believe will have an immediate and positive impact on children.
 Ideas that failed

One of the bills the alliance supported that failed was Assembly Bill 185, which sought to prevent most homeowners associations from prohibiting licensed home-based childcare operations within their communities.
“Decreasing those barriers for licensure would mean increasing the ability to serve more of Nevada’s families, and the cost of care would decline as we know that home based care is oftentimes more affordable,” Dr. Jamelle Nance, director of early childhood policy for the alliance, said.
The bill received some bipartisan support, but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In his veto message he wrote the legislation “disrupts that balance by stripping HOAs of a key element of their regulatory authority.”
“While expanding access to child care is an important goal for supporting a productive workforce, AB 185 addresses the issue in a way that undermines the foundational principles of homeowners’ associations,” he wrote. 
The alliance also backed Assembly Bill 388, which would have required employers with 50 or more employees to implement a paid family and medical leave. It wouldn’t have gone into effect until Jan. 1, 2028.
Nance said the policy was “important for the financial stability of Nevada families.”
The bill was opposed by business industry groups like chambers of commerce.
In his statement, Lombardo sided with businesses.  
“Nevada has long prided itself on maintaining a business-friendly environment-one that supports growth, innovation, and job creation,” Lombardo wrote in his veto message. “Now is not the time to introduce broad, burdensome mandates that would significantly disrupt this balance, particularly for Nevada’s small and mid-sized businesses.”
Assembly Bill 339 sought to establish an office of children’s mental and behavioral health within the Department of Health and Human Services to streamline and connect the provision of mental and behavioral health services for children.
The bill didn’t advance on its own but its language was amended into the governor’s health care bill to become the framework for the Office of Mental Health, according to Carissa Pearce, the health policy manager with the alliance.
Lombardo’s health care bill, Senate Bill 495, was also amended by Democrats to include language related to freestanding emergency rooms, which caused Senate Republicans to vote against the bill. It never received a vote in the Assembly.
Senate Bill 306 would have required the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human Service to create a task force looking at transitional housing for youth discharged from treatment facilities. 
“The bill proposed the creation of a multi-agency task force to design transitional housing and support services for children when they’re discharged from psychiatric facilities or released on parole,” said Annette Dawson Owens, the community engagement manager for the alliance. “It was commonly referred to as the ‘no eject, no reject bill.’”
The bill went through several amendments and ultimately died.
  What progress was made

Despite several bills the group back failing, Dawson Owens said the session passed legislation that would benefit children in the state.
Among these was Senate Bill 284, which puts more parameters on child welfare agencies regarding how it deals with the federal benefits children in the agency receive.
Jonathan Norman, statewide advocacy, outreach and policy director for the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers, said on Tuesday that the bill will stop child welfare agencies “from intercepting and using the child’s federal benefit, which could be social security disability, (Veterans Affairs) benefit or a death benefit to cover the cost of that child being in foster care.”
Nevada is the sixth state to pass this type of legislation, he added.
Other bills the alliance highlighted as a positive for the well being of child included:

Senate Bill 183, which prohibits child welfare agencies from assigning more than 30 children to a caseworker. It makes exceptions to allow siblings to be assigned to the same caseworker.
Senate Bill 165, which creates a profession of licensed behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board of Psychological Examiners for the supervised clinical use of prevention and early intervention strategies relating to children’s mental health.
Senate Bill 460, a heavily negotiated education bill between Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Lombardo that, among other things, attempts to expand pre-kindergarten programs by extending eligibility for state-funded pre-K and raising the household income for eligibility to 250% of the federal poverty level.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMGP2433-scaled-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-02 08:00:55.282100

Susie Lee holds press confrence at Spanish Hills Wellness Suites in Las Vegas to highlight Medicaid cuts in GOP-backed megabill. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis)Spanish Hills Wellness Suites is one of several nursing homes in Nevada that would be forced to reduce services for medically vulnerable patients who rely on Medicaid as a result of President Donald Trump’s domestic spending and tax cut bill.
Tuesday morning, the Senate narrowly cleared Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” which would cut $930 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years, a major healthcare program that serves low income families and disabled people. The Senate version of the bill now goes back to the House for consideration as Congress attempts to meet Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.
Under the bill, Nevada stands to lose about $590 million in federal Medicaid funding, resulting in more than 114,500 patients in the state losing healthcare coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Following the Senate vote, Democratic Rep. Susie Lee toured the Spanish Hills Wellness Suites in Las Vegas to emphasize the devastating impact the proposed bill, if passed in its current form, would have on Nevada Medicaid patients.
“What it will do is have an impact of forcing facilities like this one and hospitals to shut their doors. We already have a health care shortage in our state, so this will only exacerbate it,” Lee said.
Spanish Hills Wellness Suites houses about 150 patients who need long-term and short-term care post-hospitalization; 70% of those residents rely on Medicaid to pay.
“These are long-term patients with chronic conditions who’ve been here for years,” said Jyesebelle Ocampo, the director of nursing for the facility. “That’s why they’re scared. If no one is paying, how can we operate?”
The Spanish Hills Wellness Suites is not unique. Nevada relies heavily on Medicaid. Approximately 800,000 Nevadans, or about 20% of the total population, are covered by the program.
“Medicaid is a foundational part of our health care system, with about 60% of Nevada nursing home residents relying on Medicaid to access the care that they need,” said Brett Salmon, president and CEO of Nevada Health Care Association.
The GOP-backed megabill would reduce access to long-term care services for people enrolled in Medicaid by reducing federal funds for nursing facilities. Long-term care providers in Nevada said those cuts could lead to reduced staffing and tightened eligibility requirements in long-term care facilities in the state.
Long-term care services are extremely expensive and are not typically covered by other health insurance programs. Medicaid is the primary insurer for long-term care nationwide, according to the health policy think tank KFF.
“Reductions in Medicaid would impact our ability to operate and care for our residents. It would strain our ability to retain staff, invest in care improvements and meet the growing demand for services that we provide our residents,” Salmon said.
Lee warned that reductions in Medicaid funding through the GOP-backed megabill could lead to significant funding cuts for nursing homes, including reduced services, increased costs for residents and their families, and even potential closures of facilities.
“It’s not just hospitals and nursing homes that will turn patients away or close down, but it jeopardizes hundreds of clinics that provide breast cancer screening, critical health care and so much more,” Lee said.
The largest source of federal Medicaid spending cuts under the Senate bill would come from stricter work requirements on beneficiaries, including people up to age 65. Another major provision would eliminate tax credits used to purchase Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace for those who do not meet work requirements.
Lee argued Republicans in Congress were pushing “the largest cuts to healthcare coverage in U.S. history” in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.3 trillion to the national debt.
“We’re literally asking our children, our grandchildren, to pay for these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans,” Lee said.
Medicaid is a major source of health care coverage for thousands in Nevada. The Affordable Care Act allowed states to opt into expanded Medicaid coverage in 2014. 
Prior to the Medicaid expansion, Nevada was among the states with the highest percentage of adults with no health insurance. With the expansion, Nevada’s uninsured rate dropped from 22% in 2012 to 10% in 2024, according to KFF.
“Most Americans have at least some connection to Medicaid, whether it be through health insurance, home health care, nursing home care, or coverage for a child,” Lee added.
On Sunday, before the Senate vote, the White House published a post repeatedly stating that the “big beautiful bill” will not cut Medicaid funding.
Vice President JD Vance, who cast the tiebreaking vote Tuesday to pass the Senate bill 51-50, said in social media posts the Medicaid cuts are “immaterial” compared to savings the bill would bring through expanding immigration enforcement.
Lee rejected those claims, calling the bill a “big bullshit bill.”
“It is a lie. When you cut $7 billion from the state of Nevada, trust me, people will lose their health care,” Lee said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC07043-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 08:00:55.282100

Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters
Schools are scrambling to plan for what could become a massive budget hole after the Trump administration said Monday it would not release nearly $7 billion in K-12 education funds that had been expected to go out July 1.
The withheld funds, which were approved by Congress earlier this year, include all $890 million meant to help English learners develop their language skills and $375 million to provide academic support to the children of migrant farmworkers, according to an email that was sent to states by the U.S. Department of Education and obtained by Education Week.
The money being held back also includes $2.2 billion in Title II funds that support teacher training, $1.4 billion for before- and after-school programs, and $1.3 billion in funding for academic enrichment programs, such as STEM and college and career counseling.
Several states, Democratic lawmakers, and education advocacy groups are calling on the Trump administration to release the money, calling the move an illegal act of impoundment. The Education Department referred inquiries to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Congress had previously approved this funding as part of a continuing budget resolution in March, which was supposed to keep K-12 education funding mostly level for the 2025-26 school year. But the Trump administration told states on Monday that it has not yet decided how this money will be allocated, and won’t send funding notices until it completes a review, the email obtained by Education Week stated.
In a Tuesday press conference, California education officials said the Trump administration’s letter indicated the money was being held back to ensure the funds were spent in accordance with the president’s priorities. As it has in other recent instances, California will “continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Superintendent Tony Thurmond told reporters.
The unreleased funding aligns with many of the K-12 budget cuts the Trump administration proposed to make in fiscal 2026 — cuts that Congress has yet to vote on and which shouldn’t affect schools’ bottom lines until the 2026-27 school year.
In a written statement, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the vice chair of the Senate appropriations committee who also sits on the Senate education committee, said the funding holdup had forced schools to delay hiring staff and pause initiatives for students.
“Local school districts can’t afford to wait out lengthy court proceedings to get the federal funding they’re owed — nor can they make up the shortfall, especially not at the drop of a pin,” Murray wrote.
Ray Hart, the executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents many of the nation’s large urban districts, said schools were counting on this money to pay teachers and principals, provide summer school, and cover school safety costs.
Holding back the after-school funding affects nearly 10,000 after-school programs, said Jodi Grant, the executive director of Afterschool Alliance, and has left many worried they will have to close.
In a Tuesday press conference, advocates for immigrant children and English learners sounded the alarm about how withholding Title III funds would hurt schools’ ability to hire translators and staff to work with multilingual students and host workshops for immigrant families.
Some summer programs that rely on Title III funds to train school staff were put on hold, said Susanne Pena, an assistant teaching professor at Florida International University. (The Trump administration gutted the Education Department office that used to oversee Title III earlier this year.)
“Families who do not speak English could be cut off from schools and the support system that they need in order to help their students be successful,” said Anabolena DeGenna, the superintendent of Oxnard School District in southern California.

No surprise that supporters of Israel object to Palestinian flags. The flags represent the 100-year struggle for the liberation of the country of Palestine from Zionist colonization and apartheid. 
This colonization was sponsored first by Britain (No Kings!) and then by the U.S. But for the growing movement against President Donald Trump and authoritarianism in the U.S., the struggle for freedom and equality in Palestine means much more.

Listen to the message from Palestinian-American student Hisham Arwatani at the Burlington No Kings rally: “As we stand here today, unified in common cause, we must realize that no struggle stands in isolation. The migrant camps of El Salvador are modeled after the prisons of Israel, and ICE has been unleashed to suppress Palestinian and undocumented alike. We are facing a seething force of hatred and division, and we must stand in lockstep to fight it.” 
Arwatani, a target of a shooting in Burlington, knows about the violence of occupation and genocide boomeranging back to the U.S., fueling the far right and being used to attack our free speech, dissent and aspirations for justice and dignity for everyone.

I’ve seen firsthand how our schools are sustained by the steady, collective effort of people who really care.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pam Reed: The quiet moments that matter.","This commentary is by Pam Reed, incoming superintendent of Rutland City Public Schools.


In my years working in education, here’s something I’ve learned along the way: the most impactful moments usually happen quietly.
It’s a student finally mastering a skill after weeks of struggle. It’s a teacher staying late to find the right way to help someone who is having a tough time. It’s a quick exchange with a bus driver that brightens a student’s entire outlook.
These moments aren’t flashy, and they can be fleeting. But they are the moments that really shape who we become, both individually and as a community.
As I step into the role of superintendent, I’m mindful that one of my greatest responsibilities is to preserve and strengthen our ability to create those moments. My job is not to have every answer or to impose big ideas from above. It’s to ensure our schools have the resources and support they need to thrive. To create an environment that allows students, teachers and all of our staff to flourish. 
I am sincerely thankful to Superintendent Bill Olsen for his leadership during some of the most tumultuous years in the recent history of education. Since 2020, Bill’s steady guidance and thoughtful decision-making have helped Rutland City Public Schools navigate enormous challenges: from the initial days of the pandemic to ongoing pressures around staffing and shifting models of learning, to his work on securing a more equitable education funding formula in Vermont.
His example has set a clear foundation that I’m committed to building upon. He did far more than simply keep our district afloat; his leadership strengthened our schools and positioned us for continued growth and excellence.
I am also grateful to our school commissioners. Their service is made up of quietly important moments. They aren’t driven by the need for recognition but by genuine care and a commitment to our schools. Their work exemplifies the unsung dedication that keeps our district moving forward.
As someone raised in Rutland, who has spent the majority of my career here and has served in a range of roles across this district, I’ve seen firsthand how our schools are sustained by the steady, collective effort of people who really care. Each role matters, and each contribution makes a difference, creating a community where students know they truly belong.
There will certainly be difficult decisions ahead, as there always are. But when I look at Rutland City Public Schools, I see tremendous reason for optimism and pride. I see resilience and kindness from students every day. I see educators and educational support professionals who go the extra mile without expecting praise. I see a community consistently willing to show up for one another and engage.
It’s these quiet but powerful realities that drive my commitment as superintendent and my love for public education, particularly in Rutland.
From teachers in classrooms to custodians and coaches, from bus drivers to kitchen staff, and everyone else who quietly cares for our students. Every person contributes something meaningful and essential to our school community.
Together, deliberately and thoughtfully, we’ll build on the strong foundation we already have, ensuring that impactful moments continue to happen for our students every day. I am honored to step into this role, and I look forward to the work ahead.

The work is not complete, and both the legislators and the governor admit that. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eric Peterson: Gov. Scott’s big beautiful bill.","This commentary is by Eric Peterson of Bennington. He was a longtime columnist for the Bennington Banner and Berkshire Eagle and has also written columns for the Albany Times Union.


As the landmark education bill struggled mightily to be born in the Legislature, the question became whether it could be Phil Scott’s crowning achievement. 
Gov. Scott is serving his fifth two-year term as governor of Vermont. Only in New Hampshire and Vermont do governors serve two-year terms, the other 48 states are all four years. It means a Vermont governor only has one year in which to enact his/her major program before having to run yet again for reelection.
A comprehensive bill can take the full two years. Vermont’s legislators work part-time. A session lasts five or six months. There will continue to be meetings during the summer but the whole legislature won’t return to Montpelier until the new year.
The myriad problems of Vermont’s schools have worried governors, legislators, teachers and parents for many years. This year there was finally a serious attempt to vault the state’s education system into the 21st century.
Scott has been a successful and popular governor. His style is often to respond to the legislature. He softens the Democratic majority’s policy prescriptions to make them semi-palatable to the Legislature’s Republicans and to Vermont’s conservative voters.
Scott has been a “make no waves” kind of chief executive. He rarely leads with proposals with his personal vision of a Vermont of the future. The two-year terms are an encumbrance to serious, thoughtful planning for the future. But so is Scott’s seeming reticence to lead.
This is not entirely the governor’s fault. Democrats have been Vermont’s majority party for years, although they did lose their supermajority in the state senate last year. Scott is also a member of a vanishing breed, a moderate Republican. The national party has moved not so much rightward as Trumpward.
There was a time when Green Mountain State Republicans such as Aiken, Stafford and Snelling (More Dick than Barbara) were not entirely out of step with other Republican officeholders throughout the country. The Vermonters were often more cordial and less dogmatic while remaining small-government conservatives. In today’s political world Governor Scott continues the Vermont Republican traditions and finds himself basically adrift in sensible Vermont.
The work is not complete, and both the legislators and the governor admit that. Work is expected to continue through the next session. Vermont parents and school board members will have their say over the next several months as they read about the plan and talk to your representatives and their neighbors.
Rep. Jonathan Cooper is a bright, impressive young first-term member of the Vermont House representing Pownal, Readsboro, Searsburg, Stamford and Woodford. Cooper, a Democrat, is a regional planner with two master’s degrees. He is the father of a young student.
In an email exchange with Rep. Cooper, I asked him about his first session as a representative and questioned him about issues including the education bill. Representing several small towns, he is alert to the many problems facing rural communities with dwindling numbers of students.
In Rep. Cooper’s district there are two schools with a warm place in my heart: Pownal Elementary School and Woodford Hollow Elementary School.
The theatre arts high school class I co-taught in Bennington created a program at Woodford Hollow in which our students worked with their students. I also directed the school play, an after-school program, at Pownal School for several years.
The faculty at both schools were dedicated and their students were bright and enthusiastic. It made me a strong proponent of bringing high school and elementary school students to work together and an admirer of the close bonds students make in small schools.
Mr. Cooper voted in favor of the education bill saying, “I voted for the fairness and accountability within the bill: fairness in how Vermont’s kids benefit from our education resources, and accountability in how Vermont’s education system meets our students’ needs  … We have lost almost 50 percent of our public-school population in the last 40 years, but the administrative presence is even larger than it was back then.”
Rep. Cooper is correct and that, in a nutshell, is the problem. Fewer students, larger expenses.
Cooper referenced the Vermont Supreme Court Brigham ruling that it was unfair and unconstitutional to let each town or school district decide how much it wanted to spend on its own. “At that time, “Cooper wrote, “a student in the highest spending town received 2.5 times the education funding of a student in the lowest spending town.”
But by 2025, Cooper wrote, “A student in Vermont’s highest-spending town received more than three times the education funding of a student in the lowest-spending town.”
Cooper wrote that legislators were “clear-eyed” that more work remained to be done, and that Gov. Scott’s team was involved “every step of the way” and that the number of Republican senators and representatives is proof of that.
Jonathan Cooper is a young man with a bright future. One can hope he continues his legislative career well beyond his first term.
It might also be beneficial if Gov. Scott decides that getting the education bill right and finished will be his goal. That may take sacrifice.
Announcing before or early in the next legislative session that all his attention will be on preparing the Vermont education system for the next 30 years will be his overriding concern. Therefore, he will not seek a sixth term as governor.
That would allow him to go out a winner and to be long remembered as the governor who greatly improved the state’s education model. It will also allow Vermont to acquire new eyes and fresh thinking for other challenges facing the Green Mountain State.

He said he found the firearms culture in New Jersey ""ridiculously white"" when he moved here from Virginia in 1993 and aims to change that. (Photo courtesy of Tony Simon)Paterson police denied Mahmoud “Mo” Ramadan’s request for a gun carry permit after he hounded them — and the mayor — about their poky pace in processing his application. Sharon Palombi got denied in South Toms River because of her past police involvement as a crime victim. And Leonard Mirabal’s extensive — but non-criminal — driving infractions prompted Carlstadt cops to refuse his carry request.
New Jersey law lays out several documentable reasons why police can deny carry permits, including if applicants have criminal convictions, histories of addiction or mental health disorders, or active restraining orders. But it also allows officers to make subjective judgments and reject applicants they deem lack “the essential character of temperament necessary to be entrusted with a firearm.”
Consequently, a growing, disgruntled group of applicants — including Ramadan, Palombi, and Mirabal — have successfully challenged denials, which two recent studies found have disproportionately impacted people of color in New Jersey.
Now, a Republican state lawmaker wants police to answer to the Legislature and the public on the issue, by mandating monthly reporting on permit denials. Municipalities would have to publicly detail their reasons for denying firearm purchaser identification cards and gun carry permits under a bill Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) introduced Monday. The measure also would require reporting on the age, race, gender identity, and ethnicity of denied applicants.
“There are barriers to exercising your Second Amendment — prior felonies, mental health concerns — that are valid concerns. But the color of your skin is not a valid concern,” Fantasia said. “There should be no subjective measures. When you allow subjective measures into the conversation, that leaves it up to people, to personalities, to preconceived notions, and to bias, and that’s what we want to remove. There should never be bias associated with your ability to exercise a constitutional right.”
The attorney general’s office already publicly reports applicant demographics but does no analysis of denials and attributes more than two thirds of them to unspecified “public health, safety and welfare” concerns or just “other disapproval reasons.”
John Petrolino, a firearms instructor and freelance writer who focuses on Second Amendment issues, dove into the data last year and found that Black applicants were denied permits for subjective reasons at twice the rate of whites.
Academic researchers with the nonprofit Rise Against Hate drilled deeper into the data and determined the denial disparities reflected “major systemic issues,” given that people of color applying for carry permits passed the same initial screening requirements (to get firearm ID cards) as white carry applicants. Those researchers also found that denials disproportionately impacted Hispanic applicants too, and that disparities (for subjective and objective reasons) were worst in Ocean, Gloucester, and Cumberland counties.
They recommended policymakers mandate more detailed explanations for denials, anti-bias training for law enforcement officers overseeing permit decisions, and increased transparency to eliminate disparities they deemed systemic.
Spokespeople for the attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment about racial disparities in denials.

 Targeting restrictions in court — and municipal ordinance
Fantasia, a longtime gun owner and hunter, said she relies on firearms for protection, as both a single mother of three and someone who was held up at gunpoint at the fast-food restaurant where she worked when she was 17.
“Ever since then, it’s always been imprinted in me,” Fantasia said of her enthusiasm for gun rights.
She has introduced other gun-related legislation in Trenton, including measures that would create Second Amendment license plates and allow school security officers with carry permits to take their guns onto school grounds and buildings.
She hasn’t yet lined up a Senate sponsor for her bill to mandate public reporting on denials, but she thinks it should have broad, bipartisan appeal because it’s about transparency and disparities.
“It really is an issue of: why are we discriminating?” she said.
The bill, which Assemblyman Bob Auth (R-Bergen) also signed on to sponsor, would require the state attorney general’s office to report in detail on denials dating back to June 2022. That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling known as Bruen, declared gun owners have a constitutional right to carry guns, and states cannot require gun owners to prove a need to take firearms outside their homes or businesses.
Applications for carry permits have soared in New Jersey since Bruen, with police fielding almost 77,000 between Bruen and May 31, data shows. Less than 1,500 of them were for renewals; the rest were new applicants, the data shows. Four hundred applicants were denied.
The New Jersey Firearms Owners Syndicate is pushing for Fantasia’s legislation, which has the same goals as a measure now stalled in Congress. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky) introduced a bill in March that would mandate federal reporting on permit denials.
The syndicate endorsed Fantasia’s reelection bid in May and named her Legislator of the Year.
Joe LoPorto, the group’s director of legal operations, said Bruen was clear that subjective denials cannot stand.

“The whole point was to establish that law enforcement agencies couldn’t arbitrarily decide who and who couldn’t exercise their rights,” LoPorto said. “For Second Amendment purposes, background checking should be straightforward. There really shouldn’t be subjective standards at all, and we’re not getting enough information on why these denials are coming out the way that they are.”
Ramadan seconded that sentiment, saying his fight isn’t just one of principle. His permit denial kept him from landing a job in armed security, he said.
“I think the answer here is, literally, just follow what the Constitution says and stop trying to abuse your authority,” Ramadan said.
The bill is part of a widening strategy gun-rights groups have undertaken since Bruen to try to dismantle New Jersey’s famously tough gun restrictions.
Gun owners challenged a state law Gov. Phil Murphy signed in December 2022, in response to Bruen, that barred guns from sensitive places like arenas, polling places and beaches, create new training requirements, and hike permitting fees, among other things.
Two years since lawyers argued the matter in court, a federal appellate panel still has not issued its ruling. The law, though, largely remains on hold until the court challenge is resolved.
Gun owners have also taken their fight to municipal meetings around the state, lobbying local officials to give up the higher gun-permit fees state legislators mandated in the December 2022 law.
Englishtown and Franklin recently became the first towns statewide to authorize municipal officials to refund $150 — the local portion of permit fees — to applicants. LoPorto said officials in about a dozen other towns, including Park Ridge, Dumont, Absecon, and West Amwell, also are considering dropping the local fees.
“It’s as much about providing relief for the residents of these towns as it is about sending that statewide message that this is fundamentally unfair,” LoPorto said of the push to eliminate such fees.

When Tony Simon moved to New Jersey from Virginia in 1993, he found the firearms culture here “ridiculously white.”
Now Simon, a firearms instructor and military veteran who lives in Ewing, runs The Second Is for Everyone diversity shoots at gun ranges around the state to bring people into the gun community who have historically felt excluded.
The subjective judgments built into the gun permitting process in New Jersey ensure police will not enforce gun regulations equally, and denial disparities will persist, Simon said.
“I think it’s a racist system,” he said. “You go in. They say: ‘Well why do you want a gun? Why do you need a gun?’ They make it complicated. I’ve heard stories from people: ‘They treated me like a criminal, an international drug dealer, a terrorist.’ When you have rules like this, it’s not going to be enforced in Berkeley Heights, in the high-end neighborhoods. It’s going enforced on the poor people and the brown people.”

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.
Judge gives administration until Tuesday to put birthright citizenship plans in writing

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said. 
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC_1049-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 07:05:30.500466

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.












It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities




“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)State government officials rescinded 8,486 hybrid remote work agreements Tuesday as Gov. Mike Braun’s push to return state employees to the office takes full effect.
Indiana Secretary of Management and Budget Lisa Hershman said there will be no more hybrid arrangements — employees will either work solely in state offices or solely at home. Each agreement applies to a single employee.
“We looked at what makes sense to maximize value and productivity, and so we didn’t have a steadfast goal, but we knew that we were missing out on collaborative opportunities,” she said.
The state dropped from 10,588 active remote work agreements in January when Braun’s executive order was issued to 9,293 as of June 23.
As of July 1 that number is down to 537, the state personnel department reported Tuesday. But they are still documenting employees who have always worked entirely off-site or whose roles have been identified as best performed remotely full-time per the new policy. Once those records are captured, the number of active agreements should rise by roughly 1,200 over the next few months.
“That’s working fine,” Gov. Mike Braun told reporters recently. “Some, of course, didn’t like that. Most, I think, have come back. You know we’ve got a low unemployment rate in the state, so everybody’s going to be able to find something else. But that’s gone pretty smoothly.”
New executive orders seek to ‘deregulate’ Indiana agencies, force state workers back to offices

According to the Indiana Transparency Portal, the total number of state employees fell from 32,212 in December 2024 to 31,222 as of June 21 — a drop of almost 1,000 workers.
Hershman said there is still flexibility in the process. That’s why the administration took months of planning and examined job duties, budgets, office space, parking and technology needs.
“We were taking in a lot of input and to pull the band aid off is a very tough approach. And so that’s why we approached it a little bit in a more fluid way,” she said.
Hershman noted, for instance, that the July Fourth holiday week coincided with some vacations, allowing the state to track limited resources as employees trickle back into the office. Officials are monitoring parking in downtown Indianapolis state lots to see if that’s a problem, and mentioned that shuttles have been used in the past.
State Personnel Director Matthew Brown issued updated guidance on June 29 that establishes eligibility requirements, procedures, and recommendations for limited remote work.
“This policy emphasizes the inherent benefits of in-person collaboration while furthering governmental efficiency and responsiveness without sacrificing accountability,” the new policy said.
Some exceptions allowed
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb tried to bring many state employees back into state office buildings after the pandemic, but employees resisted and left for other jobs. That led to higher turnover and a policy reversal.
Hershman said the concern remains valid, and that Indiana is committed to attracting and retaining talent. She said they listened to employees voicing frustration in key cases.
For instance, while some employees are returning to the office, others might be moving from a hybrid approach to fully remote. That is true for those working state call centers.
She said data shows they are more productive at home and metrics are easy to track on their work.
“We took that into consideration and benchmarked that industry,” she said. “We wanted to understand what the needs of our constituents were, what our workforce talent was needing, and try to marry those so this was not something abrupt, and it we tried to be deliberately designed for the greatest impact.”
Hershman also noted the state will be flexible on when an employee works in the office. She said employees might share workspace and work different hours – perhaps one starting at 6 a.m. and another in late afternoon.
The new guidance has key rules for any remote work, including:

Remote work must be performed within the geographical boundaries of Indiana unless traveling for official functions or expressly authorized by the agency head and cabinet secretary.
Remote Work Agreements for hybrid schedules in existence on June 30, 2025, which are not an authorized exception as a reasonable accommodation, are rescinded. Employees shall work full time in an assigned office, facility, or field location and not from a remote location unless the agency head has determined remote work is required either full-time or on an ad hoc basis to accomplish specific operational objectives.
Remote work is not a substitute for child or dependent care. Employees approved for remote work must continue to arrange for child or dependent care to the same extent as if they were working at the office.
A remote work site must be safe and must have reliable internet access, a state-issued computer (or a personal computer utilizing IOT-approved security technology), and a phone line (that is, a state-issued cellular phone, a personal cellular phone compliant with IOT policies, or a landline). Employees shall be responsible for the security of all data, documents or information used for state business purposes.
Any remote work agreements are good for one year only, and will be renewed each January.

In order to provide the minimum of appropriate care, researchers and the Treatment Advocacy Center regard 30 psychiatric beds for every 100,000 residents living in a state. A 2024 report from the Treatment Advocacy Center, a non profit that advocates for timely access to mental health care, found that Michigan has about 19 beds per 100,000 residents, a shortage of about 1000 beds.
And what that shortage means, particularly for children, is families having to send children going through mental health crises to residential programs in other states, Marianne Huff, president and CEO of the Mental Health Association of Michigan told lawmakers during a meeting of the Michigan House Public Health and Food Security Committee.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
And the only ways kids with serious emotional disturbances can access that specialized residential treatment is if they encounter the juvenile justice system, Huff said.
“We really need to broaden and strengthen the continuum of care. Kids should not have to go into the juvenile justice system to get residential treatment, which is typically out of state,” Huff said. “Unless you’ve experienced or had to navigate behaviors with a child with serious emotional disturbance, it can be really hard to imagine how emotionally and physically and psychologically difficult and draining that can be for parents…I think we need to be looking at the full continuum… not just emergency rooms or state hospitals or outpatient. It’s what we can do to mitigate the behavior and the symptoms so that people don’t need to end up in longer term placements.”

Michigan’s lack of temporary long-term placements for individuals experiencing severe mental health crises both impacts the health care system and the criminal justice system that are each doing what they can to make up for Michigan’s lack of robust mental health infrastructure, former Corporate Counsel for the Kalamazoo County Community Mental Health Authority Steven Burnham told lawmakers.
Having spent time working with the county’s community mental health resources, Burnham said he remembers getting confused when a 12-year-old or 15-year-old would be entering the criminal justice system when it was clear they needed mental health resources. 
“We’re either all the way here or all the way there, and we have nothing in the middle,” Burnham said. “What we need is access to longer length of stay treatment… state hospital level of care, highly trained, fully staffed, specialized residential options.” 
In Grand Traverse County, the county’s sheriff’s office is attempting to address a psychiatric crisis and are unable to connect individuals who are incarcerated with appropriate services in a timely measure, though the department dedicates a great deal of time and money trying, case manager and social worker for the department Sarah Bush told lawmakers.
The department is responsible for 169 incarcerated individuals currently, with 38 individuals being determined to be “severely and persistently mentally ill” Bush said, and 85 of the cases involve diagnosis of substance use and mental health.
When the department attempts to get individuals high acuity hospital beds for individuals experiencing mental health crises, the department has to dedicate an officer to stay with them until they get a bed, which often there is not one that can be made available so they are transported back to the department, Bush said.
This process has cost the sheriff’s department over 197 hours of overtime as officers often have to transport individuals 4 hours down to Detroit to try and get a bed space, Bush said.
“We did start the jail diversion program where we are educating our officers to utilize mental health services… so that’s been working a little, but the bed placement is really where we’re struggling currently,” Bush said. 
From a community mental health perspective, Bush said it’s really difficult to see the same people, over and over again, come through the system and eventually get into the court system over issues that should have been addressed by mental health professionals and not necessarily resulted in an arrest. But once an arrest happens, it’s hard for the appropriate mental health services to be provided.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Vermont has joined more than half the states across the country in banning smartphones from schools, a move state education officials and lawmakers have said will go a long way toward alleviating compulsive social media use among teens while removing classroom distractions.
Phil Scott signed legislation into law Friday that requires Vermont schools to adopt policies prohibiting students from using cellphones and other personal devices like smartwatches from arrival to dismissal. The policies, which would include exceptions for students who need certain accommodations, must take effect in time for the 2026-27 school year. 
The law also includes a first-of-its kind provision that bars schools from using social media platforms to communicate with students, or from otherwise requiring students to have social media accounts to engage in academic and extracurricular activities. That provision took effect immediately. Although the legislation provides exceptions for certain platforms approved by school administrators, it prohibits school officials, teachers and coaches from using platforms like Facebook or Tiktok to make announcements to students.
Vermont’s move comes amid growing concerns nationwide about the emotional and cognitive impacts of smartphone and social media use among teens, which have inspired a bipartisan movement to ban personal devices from classrooms across the country. 
Over 25 other states including Virginia, Arkansas and California have passed laws that either require schools to develop phone-free policies or simply ban smartphones from public school classrooms outright at the state level. A handful of other states like Delaware and Pennsylvania have passed laws incentivizing — but not requiring — schools to adopt policies by offering funding for pilot programs. 
Several countries, including France and Brazil, have also put into place nation-wide versions of a school smartphone ban.
“We need kids to be focused on learning, interacting with their peers, teachers, and friends while they’re at school,” Scott said in a statement upon signing the bill. “And it’s clear now that phones can get in the way of important conversations and class discussions and can also be used for harmful interactions, like bullying.” 
Vermont’s law directs the state’s Agency of Education to create a “model policy” for schools to follow when enacting the device ban, though schools could choose to adopt their own policies provided they are “at least as stringent” as the one developed by the state.
Prior to the passage of the law, many schools across Vermont had already adopted classroom smartphone bans, taking varied approaches to enforcement. 
At the Harwood Union Middle and High School, which adopted a ban last year, students place phones in lockable fabric pouches at the beginning of each day. At K-8 schools in the Maple Run Unified School District, meanwhile, students who bring phones to school are asked to turn them off and leave them out of sight.
“With the passage of our bill, the school day will soon provide all Vermont kids with a respite from the pressures and harms that are now ever-present in their lives thanks to social media and other online products,”  Rep. Angela Arsenault, D-Williston, said in a press release from the advocacy group Fairplay.

CLAREMONT — The Eagle Times announced it is suspending operations, saying it is “not able to achieve business results sufficient to make the paper financially viable,” according to an email sent out Monday.
The announcement comes three weeks after the newspaper ceased printing its three-days-per week print edition, which Eagle Times owner Jay Lucas attributed to the sudden departure of key employees last month.

On Monday, the phone number of its Claremont office was out of order and Lucas did not immediately respond to an email nor a phone call seeking comment.
“Our intent from the beginning has been to do all that we can to make it a success,” said the unsigned email that went out on Monday. “Unfortunately, while the most recent management team was able to generate high quality content and publish three weekly print editions, they were not able to achieve business results sufficient to make the paper financially viable.” As a result, The Eagle Times said it is suspending operations “for the time being, pending a full review of our operations and future options,” adding that “as we move forward we will keep you informed as to our future direction.”

As faith organizations working to prevent hunger, we urge Congress to defend nutrition funding in federal budget reconciliation negotiations to protect and strengthen critical nutrition programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid. These two lifesaving programs are crucial to the health and safety of all of us.
Food isn’t just necessary; it is sacred. Across many faith traditions, there is a holy invitation to care for people in need and to feed the hungry. Faith organizations heed this call every day through serving our neighbors at food pantries, organizing food drives with partners, or coming together in prayer and reflection over local issues and needs, along with hundreds of other faith-based community partners working with the Feeding America network of food banks in Indiana. We believe that access to food and health care are vital foundations for families to succeed, and when neighbors help neighbors, communities thrive.



This commentary was written by the following faith leaders:

Marcus Casteel, Pastor of Community Engagement at Grace Church
Rt. Rev. Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows, Bishop with the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis
Rev. David M. Mellott, President of the Christian Theological Seminary
Lindsey Nell Rabinowitch, Director of the Faith & Action Project and
Rabbi Brett Krichiver with the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation




Today, this sacred call is threatened. Congress is making critical decisions that will impact whether families in our community have access to the food and health care they need to thrive. The budget reconciliation bill would reduce funding for life-saving programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, programs that support families who come to our pantry and worship alongside us. Cuts to these programs will force many of our neighbors to make impossible choices between paying for food, rent, medical care, and other basic needs.
What’s happening in Washington D.C.
SNAP is our country’s most effective anti-hunger program, providing timely and targeted grocery assistance. In fact, SNAP provides nine meals for every one meal provided by the Feeding America network of food banks and faith-based partners. But the budget reconciliation bill makes significant funding cuts to SNAP, shifting more of the cost to states, proposing new red-tape requirements tied to work and limiting SNAP’s ability to modernize and adapt to inflation. The budget reconciliation bill could take an average of 9.5 billion meals off the table for SNAP participants every year.
State: insufficient planning, funding pauses summer meals program

As costs of living remain high, more and more neighbors are coming to Indiana’s food banks and pantries for support. Living in our values of compassion and care, faith based charities have been operating at full capacity alongside food bank partners across Indiana to get food to where it’s most needed. We need to pair the critical support food banks and community organizations provide with strong federal programs and good policies that support our children, seniors, veterans and working families who are working hard to build better lives.
As the House considers its decision on the changes made to the reconciliation bill, we pray that Indiana’s Congressional Delegation will answer the call to help end hunger and reject any policies that undermine SNAP and Medicaid, programs that invest in the dignity, health and stability of our neighbors and communities. Hunger is not a partisan issue—it is a moral one that transcends divides and speaks to our shared humanity. Now is the time to stand together and ensure every Hoosier has access to the food and health care they need to thrive.

Thirty years after wolves were brought back from near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, the state of Idaho is back in the wolf-killing business. 
﻿
Based on direction from the Idaho Fish and Game Commission, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game is working to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60% over six years.
According to the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028, the state’s goal is to reduce the wolf population down from the estimated average of 1,270 wolves to a new average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves. 
Based on the population dynamics in Idaho’s wolf population, the state estimates humans would need to kill about 37% of Idaho’s estimated wolf population each year for six years to reach the goal of an average population of 500 wolves
While nearly everyone in the wolf debate says it’s extremely difficult to get an accurate count of the animals within the state’s borders, some wolf advocates don’t agree with Idaho officials on how many wolves are actually in the state due to the research methods used until recently. 
And some worry that if the state doesn’t have an accurate wolf population count, it doesn’t know how many wolves should be killed under the management plan.
 Current wolf hunting, trapping policies a grim reminder of eradication campaign from the past, early wolf member of wolf management team says
Idaho legislators are driving the policy by responding to concerns from farmers and ranchers who have had animals like sheep and cattle killed by wolves. 
Between 2014 and 2023, wolves in Idaho killed a minimum of 1,291 domestic livestock animals, according to state records. The losses affected 299 different ranchers and farmers. 
But for Marcie Carter, one of the early members of the Nez Perce Tribe’s program that managed wolves in Idaho, the expansion of wolf hunting and trapping and the government-sponsored killing of wolves in Idaho is a grim reminder of the eradication campaign that nearly killed off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1940s.
Wolves are a native species in Idaho and all across the U.S. But as setters moved West, the U.S. government passed wolf-killing bounties meant to encourage westward expansion. By 1926, rangers had killed the last wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The last wolf in Idaho was killed in the 1930s, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. 
In one of the most successful and controversial wildlife comeback stories in American history, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone and Idaho in 1995.



“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” said Carter, who now works as the watershed coordinator for the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries Resource Management.
 The impact of wolves on livestock in Idaho

Having livestock killed is a big deal to the rancher who owns that animal.
Cattle Battle: How wolves and livestock collide – and how one Idaho project offers solutions

But some wolf advocates say that, big picture, the number of livestock killed by wolves is pretty low every year. 
From 2018 to 2022, there were an average of 259 livestock deaths each year in Idaho that were deemed “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. (Depredation is the term officials use when a predator like a wolf kills or maims livestock like cattle. Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials said “confirmed” or “probable” determinations are dependent on sufficient evidence remaining, which is dependent on very rapid detection and investigation of the carcass and minimal disturbance by scavengers. Those criteria often aren’t met in remote environments, therefore the documented “confirmed” and “probable” depredations should be considered a minimum number, Fish and Game officials said.)
That’s in a state with about 2.5 million head of cattle and 235,000 sheep – including on feedlots and dairies where wolves and other predators are not present. 
That means wolves kill an average of about 0.01% of Idaho’s combined cattle and sheep population each year. 
 How does Idaho estimate its wolf population?

All sides in the wolf debate agree it is extremely difficult to produce an exact population count of wolves in Idaho. 
The state is too big, the terrain is too rugged and wolves are too elusive for that to happen.
Instead, officials use multiple different techniques to estimate that wolf population. 
Until recently, Idaho Fish and Game officials used wildlife trail cameras and a statistical model to estimate the state’s wolf population.
Some outside researchers expressed concern with the accuracy of using wildlife cameras to estimate wolf populations. 
Scott Creel, an ecologist and conservation biologist who works for Montana State University, has studied carnivores since 1987 and studied wolf-elk interactions since the 1990s.
Creel has been critical of wolf population methods used in Montana and Idaho.
“I was frustrated with seeing methods being used to estimate wolf numbers that were very indirect and, in my opinion, were unlikely to produce accurate estimates,” Creel said. “I was particularly worried that the methods I was seeing used would produce estimates that wouldn’t change, even if the wolf numbers were really changing. So the wolf population would appear to be constant, even though the policy changed just because of the way we were counting them, which is extremely oblique in both of the two methods that I was reviewing.”

The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks declined an interview request for this story.
Creel stressed that accurately estimating wolf populations is extremely difficult.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials disagree with Creel’s criticism, but acknowledged trail cam population estimation methods become less reliable when the number of images of wolves from the trail cameras declines. 
In July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game announced a new wolf population estimation procedure. 
Instead of using trail cams, officials are using new methods involving combination of genetic and information taken from a tooth of every wolf mortality documented by the state, information on the biological range of wolf population dynamics, a statistical model, and actual wolf hunting and mortality data.
It’s called the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation, which Idaho Fish and Game officials said has been used widely in other scientific fields like epidemiology and population genetics. Biometricians use that method to estimate the total number of new litters of wolf pups each year and the average estimated wolf population.
When he introduced the new wolf population estimate in July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts said the new population estimation method independently produced similar population estimates to the trail cam method’s population estimates from 2019 to 2022 using different data.
Roberts said that gives him confidence the new method produces consistent and reasonable population estimates. He also said it backs up the old trail cam method that outside researchers have publicly criticized.
“Although no population estimation technique is perfect, we now have an independent source of information that validates the camera-based estimates that we’ve been using to guide wolf management since 2019 and refutes the idea that those estimates are wildly erroneous, as some have claimed,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
But for 2023, the trail cam method and the new method produced different population estimates.
The new method estimated 1,150 wolves, while the trail cam method estimated 840 wolves, Roberts said. 
Even though it has been a year since Idaho Fish and Game officials announced their new estimation methods, the methods do not appear on the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s website for public review.
Howl reporters Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin asked Idaho Fish and Game officials for a copy of the state’s new methods for estimating the wolf population.



In March, Fish and Game officials said the only available information is a YouTube video of officials announcing their wolf population presentation. The relevant discussion takes place more than four hours into a six-hour Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting on July 24, 2024.
Officials said they are working to publish their methods. 
“We are in the process of preparing a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication on the method, which we hope to have submitted for publication later this spring or early summer,” Roberts said in March. 
As of June 24, the department had not yet published its new wolf population estimation methods in a peer-reviewed publication. Roberts said June 24 that officials are close to submitting it and hope to have it submitted for peer-reviewed publication before the upcoming July 17 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
Despite questions and criticisms of past methods, Roberts said he is confident in using the new population estimation to drive wolf management decisions in Idaho.
“Because we were able to produce five years of virtually identical estimates between (the new methods) and the camera-based methods we’ve used before, we are confident this transition will result in consistent information to inform wolf management in the state,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting. 
 Why Idaho’s wolf population estimate is important

Bob Crabtree, who founded the Yellowstone Ecological Research Center, said accuracy in wolf population estimates is extremely important.
“It’s like asking a business owner to try to make a profit or try to avoid losing money by not knowing what items they have on the shelves that they stock in their store,” Crabtree said. “Population size, or abundance, is the No. 1 criteria used to successfully manage and conserve and restore wolves. And without it, you just can’t.”
Many wolf laws and policies rely on wolf population estimates.
State Sen. Van Burtenshaw, a Republican rancher from the town of Terreton, Idaho, sponsored Senate Bill 1211, which Gov. Brad Little signed into law in 2021. 
The law removed the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters could buy each year, legalized wolf trapping year round on private property and allowed the state of Idaho to contract with federal agencies and other third parties to kill wolves.
Burtenshaw said he pushed for the law because his constituents told him there are too many wolves eating too much livestock.
“The big thing was the amount of farmers and ranchers that were dealing with significant losses because of the wolf population,” Burtenshaw said. “Originally when the wolf was reintroduced, they were talking about 150 or something in the Idaho region. And we had well over 1,500, almost 1,600, for a long time. So the depredation cost was huge to those that had livestock and other animals as well.”
“That population has kind of got out of balance, and that’s what we’re trying to figure out is where that balance is,” Burtenshaw said.

 The impact of wolf hunting in Idaho

Idaho sold more than 53,000 wolf tags to hunters in 2023 even though there are only an estimated 1,150 wolves in the state, according to documents provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. 
More than half of those wolf tags were sold in the popular “sportsman’s package,” which includes a hunting/fishing combo license and tags for deer, elk, bear, wolf, mountain lion, turkey, salmon and steelhead. (State officials said they do not know the percentage of hunters who bought a wolf tag because wolves are the primary animal they are hunting vs. the percentage of hunters who primarily hunted other animal species but still bought a wolf tag.) 
From the 2019-20 wolf hunting season through the 2023-24 hunting season, hunters and trappers killed an average of more than 400 wolves a year in Idaho, according to Idaho Fish and Game.

In addition to expanding wolf hunting and trapping, Idaho also financially reimburses expenses for hunters who successfully kill a wolf.
Since 2019, the state of Idaho has paid out $849,750 in reimbursements to successful wolf hunters, according to data provided by the Idaho Fish and Game.
The money is Idaho Fish and Game funding that is transferred to the Wolf Depredation Control Board for the Foundation for Wildlife Management’s reimbursement program, Fish and Game officials said. Separately, the foundation has applied for and received Idaho Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants.
“Our end (goal) in this originally was focused on trying to direct the harvest where we were seeing the greatest impacts – chronic livestock depredation, elk populations below objective, where predation was a factor – to try to focus that effort where harvest at that time was not sufficient to stabilize the wolf numbers,” said Idaho Fish and Game Deputy Director of Operations Jon Rachael, who was an original member of the wolf recovery team.
In the context of hunting, the word harvest means successfully killing a game animal such as a wolf. 
The reimbursement money can be used for firearms, ammo, traps, trail cameras, gear, license fees, fuel and even ATV vehicles used to scout or hunt wolves, according to the foundation.
Rusty Kramer, the president of the Idaho Trappers Association, said he has used state reimbursement money to make payments on his truck, which he uses when he is tracking and trapping wolves. 
The standard reimbursement in Idaho is capped at $750 per wolf.
But in areas where elk populations are below their objective, or livestock have been repeatedly killed by wolves, the reimbursement limit increases to $2,000 per wolf.
Some wolf supporters call the program a bounty system and scoff at the idea of the state sending checks to people who shot wolves to help pay off their trucks and ATVs.
But Idaho Fish and Game officials insist it is only a reimbursement program – not a bounty.
“Any of the funds that come from the state of Idaho, from the Wolf Depredation Control Board, or, in the past, from the Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants did require that this money was not just a straight payment of a certain amount, but rather the individual claiming compensation present evidence of their expenses,” Rachael said. “And so in that regard, it was compensation for their investment of buying traps or fuel to run a trap line.”
 U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed it killed juvenile wolves in Idaho

When the state kills wolves, it doesn’t just kill adult wolves that are confirmed to have attacked livestock. 
The state, other government agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services and third party contractors can kill wolf pups in their dens and their nursing mother – even if those specific wolves never attacked a cow or sheep.
“You can kill wolf puppies,” said Carter Niemeyer, a former government trapper who helped bring wolves back to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park 30 years ago and opposes killing wolf pups and many of Idaho’s wolf policies. “They’re plum legal if you kill them at a day old. Stomp their head in with your boot if you want to.”

Students at Timberline High School in Boise spoke out a few years ago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services killed wolf pups from a pack that the school symbolically adopted, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
In an October 2021 letter to Suzanne Asha Stone, a prominent Idaho wolf expert and a member of the wolf reintroduction team, former U.S. Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Jenny Lester Moffitt, confirmed the government killed eight juvenile wolves in Idaho in an attempt to relocate the larger pack and reduce the number of livestock killed.
Carter, who was on the Nez Perce Tribe’s wolf reintroduction team in the 1990s, is sickened that the state would authorize the killing of wolf pups that never disturbed livestock. 
“I mean, it’s one thing to shoot an adult,” Carter said. “But to trap puppies in the den hole? It’s just so awful. And I don’t understand how people can be that hateful to one species of animal that has a right to be here. But for sure, the state has not done their due diligence.”
“I‘ll just stop there,” Carter added. “The state of Idaho is not taking care of this species.”
Since wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011, the USDA Wildlife Services and other agencies have killed 961 wolves in Idaho, according to Idaho Department of Fish and Game documents.



Since 2018, Idaho Fish and Game has spent $817,668 on lethal control actions to kill wolves in Idaho, according to documents the department provided. That total specifically refers to Idaho Fish and Game funding through the Wolf Depredation Control Board that was not spent on reimbursements made by the Foundation for Wildlife Management. 
One of Idaho’s policies is that even when nonlethal tools are available to reduce conflicts between livestock and wolves, the state can kill wolves without first trying the nonlethal tools.
“Livestock producers may use deterrents to aid in protecting their property; however, they are not a prerequisite for lethal removal,” the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028 states. “Regardless of use or success of nonlethal methods, landowners may request a special kill permit from IDFG for use on lawfully permitted public and private lands. IDFG will continue to employ lethal removal as needed to address both individual depredations and overall population goals”
 30 years after wolf reintroduction, some of the people who brought wolves back worry about their future 

Longtime wolf advocates say the government-sponsored killing of wolves and expansions in hunting and trapping is reducing the number of wolves.
Now, 30 years after the first wolves were returned to Idaho and 14 years after they came off the Endangered Species List, several prominent members of the team that brought wolves back worry about the threats wolves face today.
River of No Return: How the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho

Niemeyer is a longtime government trapper who has tracked wolves across Idaho and Montana since before reintroduction in 1995. Intimately familiar with wolves, he was a member of the team that traveled to Canada 30 years ago to capture wolves to reintroduce them to Idaho and Montana.
For years after reintroduction, Carter studied the packs and knew the location of many dens in central Idaho. 
Niemeyer was so confident in his ability to find wolves that he regularly guided donors who supported conservation organizations into the wild to see wolves.  He knew the landscape well enough he could set up camp just close enough for the donors to see and howl for wolves as Niemeyer cooked cowboy-style dinners for the group.
But those days are over.
Over the last few years, Niemeyer said he and his longtime contacts are no longer seeing wolves in the wild the same places they always used to.
“When they’re in there, they see virtually little or no sign of any wolf existence in the Frank,” Niemeyer said, referring to the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. “If you put together what I’m seeing, or better yet, what I’m not seeing…. Nobody’s finding any wolf evidence. So where are these 1,300 or 1,500 wolves?”
Niemeyer’s luck isn’t any better than his friends.
During a Howl reporting trip in July 2024, Niemeyer found wolf scat and wolf tracks, but no wolves. And during another, separate expedition in 2024, he said he struck out entirely – he didn’t even see a wolf track. 
“The Big Buck Pack, Steel Mountain Pack, Jackson Pack, Archie Pack, I can name all these packs up there, Thorn Creek – there’s no packs in those places anymore, mostly because of domestic sheep that came in there and Wildlife Services just went to hammering wolves,” Niemeyer said. “And then you’ve got the recreational hunting and trapping that started when (wolves) were delisted.”
“You’ll still find a wolf track up in that country,” Niemeyer said. “But to say there’s anything like the numbers there were, I don’t believe it. You wouldn’t convince me.”
Carter worries about new expanded wolf hunting, trapping and lethal control policies in the state of Idaho.
“The state of Idaho is going to – if they haven’t already – plunge wolves back towards extinction, at least in Idaho,” Carter said.
“How do you manage if you don’t know how many you have?” Carter added.
She isn’t alone in worrying about the state management of wolves and the removal of limits on hunting and trapping. 
“Is it a violation of our treaty?” Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Shannon Wheeler said. “Is it a violation of something that we were meant to protect? Of course it is. Of course it’s a violation of what was here in 1855 and before then. And that’s a part of tamáalwit, or the unwritten law, which we know that Article Three and the Treaty of 1855 with the Nez Perce represents.”
Some members of the wolf reintroduction teams say attitudes are even worse today than they were 30 years ago.
“Our country’s worse now than it was in terms of polarization, so those extreme divisions have only widened and become more cemented,” said Stone, executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project. “ Back then, if I had told anyone from the opposition that didn’t want to have wolves back that they would be trapping and killing wolves 365 days of the year, using bounties to kill even pups in the den, they would have told me I was crazy and that would never happen – never happen. And we’re living it today. That is the reality on the ground today.”

Stone isn’t alone.
“Oh, I’m pretty worried,” said Doug Smith, who headed up the wolf program at Yellowstone National Park for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022. 
“Attitudes haven’t changed,” Smith said. “The fact is, they’re worse now. I’ve been studying wolves for over 40 years, and wolves have always been controversial. There’s always been people who like wolves and people who hate wolves. Now it’s like people are willing to do anything to get rid of wolves or anything to protect wolves, and they don’t want to talk to each other. I don’t think that’s progress, and right now the anti-wolf forces are winning in Idaho and Montana especially.”

Tony Evers Tuesday, with the full Senate and Assembly scheduled to take up the budget Wednesday. The committee also passed a  $2.5 billion plan for capital projects, which included a measure to start work on a project that will allow for the  closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution by 2029. 
The agreement announced Tuesday morning was negotiated by Evers, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein over the last several months and will invest over $1 billion in education and child care and cut taxes by about $1.3 billion. The deal also includes funding plans for the Department of Transportation, including funding for roads, and changes to the state’s hospital assessment to help cover Medicaid costs.
The committee’s action comes a day after the end of Wisconsin’s fiscal year. Wisconsin’s government continues to run under the current budget until a new one is signed into law. 
Legislators on both sides of the aisle had similar reactions saying the deal did not contain everything they wanted with some signaling support for the bill and others saying they will vote against it.
“This budget has involved an awful lot of compromise, both between the houses as well as with the governor’s office,” Joint Finance Committee Co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said at a press conference ahead of the meeting. “A budget is a compromise and this budget is certainly one of those.”
The committee voted 13-3 with Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) joining Republicans in favor of approving the deal. It also voted 12-4 along party lines to approve the entire budget bill to advance it to the Senate and Assembly floor.
Capital budget includes plan to close Green Bay prison 
The over $2.5 billion capital budget plan grants funding for projects at the UW system, within the Department of Corrections, Department of Health Services, Department of Military Affairs and the Department of Natural Resources.
Over $480 million — or about 18% — of the capital projects plan is for projects at campuses across the UW system and was negotiated as part of the budget deal. 
The plan also includes $225 million for the Department of Corrections, including $15 million for construction project planning for realignment of facilities and the closure of Green Bay Correctional Institution (GBCI) by 2029. 
Marklein said lawmakers were investing across Wisconsin and the DOC plans would help to start to “right-size” the state’s corrections system. 
As the state has faced a growing prison population and aging facilities, Evers had proposed a DOC capital budget of over $630 million that included renovating Waupun Correctional Institution and making it a “vocational village” as well as several other prisons. The plan culminates in the closure of the Green Bay facility. GBCI, which was originally opened in 1898, is one of the state’s oldest facilities and houses 381 more people than its intended capacity. 
Lawmakers have been interested in closing GBCI for years, but were skeptical of Evers’ plan to make that happen.
Co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) signaled that the action in the budget is just the beginning of a years-long process.
“I think that this stuff will all be figured out over several budgets,” Born said in response to questions about the capacity of the state’s prison and Waupun. “These fiscal capital projects don’t happen in two years, and they won’t in this case, either.” 
Lawmakers who represent parts of the Green Bay area said the inclusion of the GBCI closure date in the budget is a major step forward.
“Formalizing a decommissioning date into state law will ensure decisive action is taken to solve this long-standing issue and prevent the bureaucratic delays which have plagued this situation for far too long,” Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere) said. 
Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard) called GBCI “unsafe, unstable and unsustainable” and said he is thankful for the step forward.
Alluding to Evers’ plan, Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha), meanwhile, said there is a plan that lawmakers could have moved forward. He said the item in the budget seemed like a plan that was “kicking the can down the road.” 
The budget deal also includes $130 million for a Type 1 juvenile facility in Dane County. The planned 32-bed facility is the second one meant to replace youth prisons Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake — old facilities initially scheduled to close by 2021. The Department of Administration has estimated that with full funding ($124 million in bonding authority) the project could be completed by 2029. 
Lawmakers, advocates have mixed reaction to deal on K-12, higher education and child care 
Evers repeatedly said investing in Wisconsin’s K-12 and higher education systems as well as child care were his top priorities. Republican lawmakers said they were opposed to continuing state payments to child care facilities, supported cutting the UW budget and only supported incremental increases for the state’s public schools. The deal includes investment in each area.
Several Democratic lawmakers, nonetheless, had mixed feelings about the concessions Evers  and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) got from the majority party. During committee, Democrats proposed investing over $500 million in the UW system, $200 million in child care grants and expanding postpartum Medicaid coverage, though Republicans rejected those ideas. 
Under the deal, the University of Wisconsin system will get a $250 million increase, according to Evers’ office. The motion approved by the committee includes investments for general program operations, mental health, staff recruitment and retention and $94 million for staff wage adjustments.
The increase comes despite threats from Republican legislators to cut the UW system by tens of millions and as federal uncertainty, which has led some campuses to tell departments to prepare cuts
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said lawmakers were short-changing the UW system, despite it contributing heavily to the state’s economic successes.
“What they are getting is about 5% of what they said that they needed,” Roys said. Evers and the system proposed an $855 million budget increase over the biennium. “We’re going to continue to see tuition hikes, we’re going to continue to see campus closures. We’re going to continue to see the doors of opportunity closing for our kids here in Wisconsin, and they’re going to have to go out of state or go without access to higher education and I think that’s wrong.” 
Roys voted against the budget in committee, saying it would have needed to do more for the state’s kids to get her vote. “Ultimately, I want a Wisconsin, where every child, no matter who you are or where you’re from, have the opportunity to thrive,” Roys told reporters.
Stakeholders in the UW system also reacted to the budget deal on Tuesday. 
UW President Jay Rothman said on social media he is grateful for the support of Evers and the Legislature. 
“Today’s budget agreement marks the largest overall increase in investment in the UWs over two decades. For generations, Wisconsinites have invested in the UWs to provide affordable and accessible higher education. They should take great pride in what Wisconsin has built,” Rothman said. “With these new investments, the UWs can do more to provide the educational opportunities students deserve and parents expect.”
Public Representation Organization of the Faculty Senate (PROFS), the nonprofit organization of UW-Madison faculty, said it was “heartened” by the funding increase but worried about some of the concessions that Republican lawmakers got.
“We are concerned, however, that the agreement between Republican legislative leaders and the governor includes teaching-load requirements for faculty and instructional staff, which has always been the purview of the universities themselves, not the Legislature,” the organization stated. 
Under the agreement, faculty will be required to teach no fewer than 24 credits per academic year. The UW Board of Regents will have to develop a buyout policy for positions not meeting the minimum credit requirements. The budget will also include a similar policy for the Wisconsin Technical College System. 
The UW portions of the agreement will also include a cap on the number of positions that the system can have funded through general purpose revenue and program revenue and no institution will be allowed to designate more than 10% of its faculty and 10% of its academic staff to administrative duties.
Born said it was part of the compromise that Assembly Republicans made.
“It is a positive number, and most of our caucus on the Assembly side… is not happy about that because they know that there are major problems in that system that need work,” Born said. “We worked through that compromise and gave them $50 million as opposed to $800 million… to get some of those reforms.”
Child care providers will get a $330 million investment under the deal, including direct payments to continue once the Child Care Counts program lapses. A “Bridge” program will provide $110 million to help child care facilities stay open, though it will only last for a year. It also includes funding to kickstart a state-funded child care program targeted at supporting facilities serving 4-year-olds. 
“The reality is this is a small amount of money in terms of the need, and it is only for year one, so all that’s happening here is we’re kicking the can down the road on massive child care closures a year from now… I don’t count that as a huge victory,” Roys said. “To get that money there have been agreements to functionally deregulate child care, to increase ratios, to make it less safe to take away the important protections.”
Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), who said he plans to vote for the budget on the floor, said the investment would help make child care in the state more affordable and increase access. 
“While it’s not perfect, this is where we’re at with divided government,” Testin said “Maybe it’s not as far as some would like but it’s a step in the right direction.”
Funding for K-12 education will increase the special education reimbursement rate to  42% in the first year of the budget and 45% in the second year. Republican lawmakers initially approved a maximum increase of 37.5%, while Evers had proposed a 60% increase. 
There will be no general aid increase for public schools. School districts will only be able  to increase their school revenue annually by $325 per pupil by going to local property taxpayers through the referendum process.
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said it was a “little sad” Evers “had to drag the Legislature kicking and screaming to a place that is frankly insufficient for our needs.” He said the increase to special education funding likely wouldn’t end school districts’ reliance on raising revenue through  property taxes increases.
Some Democratic lawmakers and advocates said Evers needed to negotiate higher increases for schools and said the lack of general aid increase in the deal is a reason to reject it. 
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) said no general aid increases for Wisconsin’s public schools is “unacceptable,” calling the budget “Republican-led” and urging people to call their Democratic legislators and Evers’ office to tell them to vote against it. 
“This budget fails to meet the needs of our children and working-class communities,” Hong wrote in all caps on social media. “This budget is guaranteed to raise property taxes and pit students and communities against one another.” 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said he would vote “no” on the budget for similar reasons. 
“The final product falls far short of what our neighbors need and frankly what they have demanded since the beginning of this process,” Larson said, noting the lack of general aid, the school revenue increase that doesn’t keep up with  inflation and the special education rate. “For these reasons and many more, I will be voting ‘no,’ unless massive changes are adopted,” Larson said. “Democrats will be offering several amendments in pursuit of a budget that meets this moment.” 
The Wisconsin Public Education Network sent out a similar message, and called for people to call Senate lawmakers and urge them to vote against the budget.
“The compromise on the table provides $0 (none, not one pencil’s worth) in new state aid for public schools in both years of the biennium — in exchange for a welcome but inadequate increase to the special education reimbursement rate,” the organization said. “A vote for this budget is a vote for widening our gaps. Public schools will close. We will see another two years of record rates of referenda.”
Asked about advocates’ desire to try to negotiate for a general aid increase for schools, Evers said on Tuesday that there were some policies that just weren’t going to happen. He spoke to the Wisconsin Examiner Tuesday afternoon after attending a Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. event in Middleton to announce a business expansion at Catalent, a bio-health company.
“We have the largest amount of money that we’ve ever sent to our public schools coming to them, and so I know there are people that wanted everything, and when you’re in a situation where you have Republicans and Democrats [who make up] about same size of part of the government, you’re going to you’re going to have to compromise,” Evers said. “I do wish we could have put another $5 billion into it of course, but that wasn’t going to happen.”
Democrats say new maps led to budget deal, pledge to do more in majority
The budget needs 17 votes to pass in the Senate and will likely find it from a bipartisan group of lawmakers. Marklein said he was “confident” that there would be enough votes.
Slim margins in the Senate and  several Senate Republicans who said they were inclined to vote against the spending package, even ahead of the announcement of a deal, led to Democratic Minority Leader Hesselbein becoming involved in negotiations, which previously have only involved Republican legislators. Republicans have passed the budget before with only votes from their caucus, but in the Senate this year, the caucus can only afford to lose one vote.
Several Senate Democrats, including several who are serving their first term, said the budget deal was the result of new legislative maps that took effect for the first time in 2024. Under those maps, Democrats in the Senate flipped four seats, trimming the Republican majority from two-thirds to a margin of 18-15.
Freshman Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) said the state would be moving in the right direction with the budget agreement and Senate Democrats helped make it “palatable.” 
“To be clear, this budget is not ideal, but in the spirit of bipartisanship and forward progress, I am pleased to be a part of what Senate Democrats were able to do on behalf of all Wisconsinites,” Keyeski said. 
Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) said the deal reflects “bipartisanship and progress.” 
“I am proud to see it move forward,” said Habush Sinykin, who is also in her first term. “What we are seeing playing out in this budget is the consequence of Wisconsin’s new fairer maps — legislators working together to find compromise and make meaningful progress for the people of Wisconsin.”
Two other Democrats in their first term highlighted local allocations in the budget. Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) celebrated $30 million that was included in the budget for a new railroad bridge at Red Maple Road between American Boulevard and Lost Dauphin Road in West De Pere and Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) highlighted some of the items in the budget that will help her district, including the $137 million investment for UW-Oshkosh’s Polk Learning Commons.
“The new, fair maps created a balanced government, and this is the result: a government that can work together to reach an agreement where everyone walks away wishing they’d gotten more but no one leaves feeling kicked in the teeth,” Dassler-Alfheim said. “I’m hopeful that we can work together to get this over the finish line and move Wisconsin forward, together.”
Senate Democrats also said they would do more should they win a majority in future elections. 
“Because of the negotiations that we had for this budget, the outcomes were a lot better than they would have been had those individuals not been at the table, had our voices not been at the table,” said Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee). “And I just want to say that going forward for every budget. It should be like that, and don’t worry, when we’re in the majority, it will be like that, which will be in 2026.”
She told reporters she is leaning towards voting for the budget, but added, “we’ll have to see.” 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) also said electing more Democratic legislators made a difference.
“I am thankful that Governor Evers and my Senate Democratic colleagues were at the negotiating table on our state budget and have gotten some real wins for the people of Wisconsin,” Neubauer said. “There are critical investments in education, child care and the priorities of Wisconsinites in this budget, but we also know that due to years of underfunding by the GOP majorities, there is a lot that remains to be done.”
Andraca praised the new maps in the committee meeting, saying that a nearly 50-50 split in the Senate and Assembly has spurred conversations in a new way.
“Congratulations on the bipartisanship. I think this budget does a lot of good,” Andraca said, but added,  “I’m not sure it does enough to earn my vote at this time.”

As of Tuesday, Wyomingites' access to some corners of the internet was restricted by a new law requiring age verification for viewing pornography. 
The post Porn industry, Supreme Court weigh in as Wyoming requires age verification on adult sites appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyomingites this week found their access to some corners of the internet curtailed as a new state law to prevent minors from accessing sexual content came into effect. 
On Tuesday, Wyoming joined a growing number of states in requiring companies that platform material “harmful to minors” — principally pornography — to verify a visitor’s age upon their landing on the website. 
Though driven by conservative lawmakers’ growing interest in shielding the eyes of the Equality State’s youth from sexual content, the new law means porn-seeking adults will be asked by compliant websites to show government identification or a photograph of their face to their computer camera. Though the law prohibits websites from retaining that data, opponents of similar measures elsewhere have questioned how enforceable that protection will be. 
At least one major platform, Pornhub, has chosen to simply block access to its website from Wyoming IP addresses. Beginning Monday, visitors to the site were greeted with a message criticizing Wyoming’s legislation and arguing it would lead to both less privacy and fewer protections for children. 
Pornhub has initiated the same measure in 19 other states that have required age verification.
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court gave such laws the green light, ruling against the industry and finding that when balanced against the objective of protecting children, a similar measure in Texas did not violate Texans’ rights to free speech. Armed with that ruling the sponsor of Wyoming’s bill, Rep. Martha Lawley, told WyoFile she would seek to further strengthen her efforts for age verification online. 
“This decision has put to rest the one big argument that the porn industry could make,” the Worland Republican and attorney said. 
The state law that took effect Tuesday does not include criminal penalties and does not call for enforcement by the state. Instead, it gives Wyomingites a route to sue and seek hefty financial damages from companies they believe have failed to verify site visitors’ ages. Lawley didn’t pursue a more aggressive bill, she said, because she knew the issue was unsettled in the courts.

Given the Supreme Court’s ruling, Lawley now believes she can bring amendments to add criminal penalties next legislative session, she said. Such a law change would draw Wyoming law enforcement into the effort to police online pornography, instead of relying on citizens to hire an attorney and file a lawsuit.
Texas’ law found success at the Supreme Court in part because the technology for age verification has evolved to a level where it no longer marks a major intrusion on adults seeking pornography, Lawley said. And she would continue, she said, to ensure that privacy protections for that data are built into future law. 
But in an earlier step in the Texas legal battle, a federal judge concluded that the state couldn’t guarantee adult purveyors of pornography would have their privacy protected, including from the government itself. “It runs the risk that the state can monitor when an adult views sexually explicit materials and what kind of websites they visit,” Judge David Alan Ezra wrote in a September 2023 order blocking the implementation of the law. 
Ezra, appointed to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan, was overruled 2-1 by a federal appeals panel the next year, which allowed the law to go into effect while the case continued.
On June 27, the last day of its term, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Texas law with a 6-3 decision, with the three liberal justices dissenting. 
Though the prevailing justices agreed that requiring age verification online “burdens” adults, they found the burden doesn’t outweigh states’ interest in finding ways to enforce the same laws online that prevent minors from going to a gas station and buying nude magazines. “The power to require age verification is within a State’s authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion. 
But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan argued that Texas and states following its lead need to find a way to keep minors off pornography sites that doesn’t interfere with adults’ rights to free speech. In her opinion, she echoed Ezra’s concerns that there could be wide-ranging ramifications for people who give their personal data to porn sites in order to access them. 
“It is not … like having to flash ID to enter a club,” she wrote. “It is turning over information about yourself and your viewing habits—respecting speech many find repulsive—to a website operator, and then to . . . who knows? The operator might sell the information; the operator might be hacked or subpoenaed.”
In its message for Wyoming visitors, Pornhub offered an alternative strategy. The site’s home page carried a video from an adult film actress who, fully clothed, conveys the message that Pornhub believes requiring age verification will draw traffic to websites that are less likely to comply with the law because those behind them believe they can dodge enforcement. 
Website operators, who can be anywhere in the world, are difficult to police. Those sites that will dodge age verification laws are also less likely to moderate content and prevent the distribution of child sexual abuse material, the company argued. Instead, the actress and activist Cherie DeVille asks site visitors to “contact your representatives before it is too late and demand device-based verification solutions.” 
DeVille has run for elected office herself — alongside the rapper Coolio, she mounted a brief bid for president in the 2020 election under the slogan “Make America Fucking Awesome Again.” 
Device-based solutions, the safety technology preferred by Pornhub, which would have users register their device as in the control of someone older than 18. Parents could then ensure their children’s devices mark them as minors, and porn websites could block the devices based on their IP address. Such a system would also prevent children from accessing other age-restricted websites like gambling sites, tobacco or cannabis vendors, Pornhub argued in a blog post.
As the most visible avatar for a respectable adult content industry, Pornhub isn’t immune to criticism. Journalists and sexual exploitation victims have documented the presence of abusive videos, including those of minors, sexual assault, rape and other violence, on its site throughout the years. Company officials say they have reacted to such reports by tightening their content moderation procedures.

During a legislative session rife with divisive social issues, Lawley’s bill largely flew under the radar. Only one House member, Laramie Democrat Karlee Provenza, opposed it on its final vote. 
“Unfortunately, there was little appetite from members of the Legislature to consider the potential problems with this legislation,” Provenza wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “We live in a world where countless people fall victim to online scams that cost them tens of thousands of dollars every day, and the government just made it easier for people to ask for IDs for no legitimate purpose so they can steal identities. We put our constituents at risk and solved nothing.” 
In the Senate, it received three no votes, including the Senate’s two Democrats — Chris Rothfuss, also of Laramie, and Mike Gierau of Jackson. A no vote from Sen. Cale Case, a long-serving Lander Republican who leans Libertarian, made the limited opposition bipartisan. 
It remains to be seen if the bill’s implementation will draw out new opposition — whether from an unlikely to-be-outspoken constituency of Wyoming porn aficionados, or from those concerned about broader free speech ramifications. In addition to Lawley’s promise to revisit the statute in light of the Supreme Court’s decision, conservative Wyoming lawmakers are focused on regulating minors’ possible exposure to sexually explicit material in another arena: public libraries. 
Though the justices didn’t touch on libraries in their ruling, Lawley said she believed their decision could play into that debate as well. “It gives those of us who deal with policy some understanding into where the laws are in regards to free speech and obscenity and protection of children,” she said.

Just because Sen. Lee’s misguided amendment went down in flames is no reason to think that threats to public land are no more, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Wars on the West appeared first on WyoFile .","Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past couple of weeks, you know that U.S. Sen. Mike Lee withdrew his push to sell off public lands via an amendment to Trump’s budget bill. Faced with widespread and intense opposition from just about everyone west of the 100th meridian, the Utah Republican blinked.

Opinion

For more than a century, our million square mile public domain has been the battleground for more than one “War on the West.” Just because Lee’s misguided amendment went down in flames is no reason to think that these wars are over. If you believe that the good guys finally won, I have a surfside cabana on some beachfront property near Wamsutter that I’d like to sell you.
Public land has been a political fulcrum since long before Lee. Back in the ‘90s, President Bill Clinton and his Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, were accused of waging a “War on the West” for a different reason.
The Clinton administration’s decidedly pro-environment policies rubbed enough Westerners the wrong way to cause a political backlash. Gov. Mike Sullivan, a man whom I admire and respect deeply, lost his ’94 run for the U.S. Senate when his opponent tarred him with the Clinton/Babbitt “War on the West” brush.
The Trump administration’s policy of merchandising the public domain is every bit as threatening to our Western way of life as Clinton’s hands-off preservation policy. If knuckle-headed politicians get their way, “no trespassing” signs will warn us off of land that belongs to all of us.
That prospect pisses us off as citizens and custodians of public land in Wyoming. And, when we get pissed off, we tend to express our anger in the voting booth. We may not vote our opinions on any other issue, but when it comes to public land, we can and do make politicians feel the heat.
Threats to our public land heritage unify us in our rage as Westerners. We galvanize against them.
I am reminded of another “War on the West,” the Johnson County War of the late 1890s. In that boondoggle, the political power structure in Wyoming colluded among themselves to enlist gunslingers from Texas to invade Wyoming to drive out homesteaders and small ranchers, in order for the moneyed elite to have our range all to themselves.
The grassroots folk of Wyoming banded together to resist and drove off the invaders. Nate Champion — anyone in Wyoming should recognize that name — gave his life to protect our public land, and in the next election, the political enablers of the invasion were swept from office. The new governor was John Osborne, the man who skinned Big Nose George and campaigned wearing shoes cobbled from his hide. But that’s a topic for another column.
Suffice it to say that the Big Empty is littered with the political corpses of fools who try to take our public land from us, or fence us out of it.
Our current congressional delegation — Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and Rep. Harriet Hageman — would do well to remember this Wyoming history. None of them stood with their constituents while the common folks of Wyoming pushed back against Trump’s new war on our Wyoming values.
I’ve often said that the word “neighbor” is a verb in Wyoming. We might argue and fuss with our neighbor over a fenceline, an irrigation ditch or a stray bull, but when Wyomingites are faced with an outside threat, we neighbor together and fight it.
Our delegation didn’t neighbor with us on this one.
Even though the next election is more than a year away, we should not forget our delegation’s timidity when we were attacked. This Sagebrush Rebellion bullshit is far from over and, like a case of herpes, it’ll be back. We need elected officials who will stand shoulder to shoulder with us to resist it again.
We should demand that our elected officials, from the top down and regardless of party, fight any takeover of our public land. We should make that a core issue of the next election. And the next. And the one after that.
Even if a candidate is running for dogcatcher in Hyattville, we should grill them about their stance on public land, and insist that they side with us. We should know that they share our values before we honor them with our votes. Protecting our public land heritage needs to become the ON/OFF switch for political success in Wyoming. We need to count on our politicians to neighbor with us.
I, for one, want to know who is in the foxhole with me when anyone wages a War on the West.

Instead of cutting tax incentives, Congress should double down on investing in communities that have long powered America, Sophie Rockefeller contends.
The post Key provisions poised to accelerate Wyoming’s energy leadership appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is a national leader in energy production and innovation. There is an energy transformation underway, and demand is exploding. With Wyoming’s energy workforce, infrastructure and manufacturing bona fides, few states are as poised to seize this opportunity. 

Opinion

In order to achieve these all-of-the-above ambitions, there is a key role for federal incentives to get industries like critical minerals, energy production and carbon management off the ground. Leaders in Washington, D.C. are instrumental in determining the likelihood of success. 
Financial certainty enables businesses to invest in new projects and facilities, expand operations, and hire and train workers. Tax credits are not about picking winners and losers — they are about building economic momentum in Wyoming and making sure our communities are not left behind in the changing energy landscape.
Data from Utah State University and Atlas Public Policy estimate that, catalyzed by tax credits, Wyoming has already seen more than $894 million committed to manufacturing and mining. Further, the Rhodium Group and MIT show that 1,050 operational and construction jobs have been created in Wyoming as a result of energy and manufacturing investments since the second half of 2022.
Industry leaders see the writing on the wall. Rusty Bell, CEO of Energy Capital Economic Development in Campbell County, said in his community, “there’s so much happening in energy leadership and many of these energy credits play a key role in getting those projects off the ground.”
In conversations last week with Wyoming business leaders, the Jackson Hole Center for Global Affairs asked which tax incentives are most important to their operations. Those that stood out were 45Q (carbon capture), 45Z (clean fuels), 45X (advanced manufacturing) and the Energy Community Tax Credit. 45Y (Clean Electricity Production) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment) were also noted, in part because they qualify for the Energy Community Tax Credit Bonus, a 10% adder for projects built in energy communities like those in Wyoming. 
On Tuesday, the Senate passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and sent it back to the House for the final vote before it goes to the president’s desk. The Senate-passed version restores the original inflation indexing for 45Q and retains 45X (with a phase-out beginning in 2031 for critical minerals and terminated eligibility for wind components after 2027). It modifies Sections 45Y and 48E by eliminating wind and solar projects’ eligibility after 2027 and introducing severe foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions.
The current version of the bill means that the Energy Community Tax Credit, which can be applied to 45Y and 48E but not other key credits, now sits on the chopping block. Rapid phase-outs and reduced credit values threaten developers’ ability to take advantage of this bonus over the long term.
As a leading energy community, Wyoming stands to benefit perhaps more than any other state from the Energy Community Tax Credit. Rather than phasing out the credit, expanding it to align with the existing provisions that look to benefit Wyoming’s energy industries would double down on the energy leadership boom that is already underway. 
Robby Rockey, president and co-CEO of Frontier Infrastructure, supports expanding the 10% adder to drive investment in coal communities.
“It’s a bridge that connects Wyoming’s energy heritage with its innovation future,” Rockey explains. “If it were combined with credits like 45Q, 45X, and 45Z, the ECTC would have a multiplier effect that wouldn’t just attract capital, but also ensure that investment flows directly into the communities that have powered America for generations. With the ECTC, we are guaranteeing that Wyoming’s energy communities are the foundation for our next chapter in critical minerals, carbon management, and advanced manufacturing.”
These key tax provisions strengthen businesses’ ability to invest in infrastructure and supply chain capacity. They are crucial to the energy momentum already underway in Wyoming.
Now is the moment to double down on Wyoming’s energy advantage. By preserving these incentives and expanding the energy community bonus, Congress can secure a future where Wyoming leads the nation — not just in energy production, but in innovation, job creation and economic resilience.

Advocates have mixed opinions about child care provisions in the new state budget released Tuesday. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The proposed Wisconsin state budget announced Tuesday offers child care advocates less than what they sought, and while some reacted with limited optimism, for others it adds up to little better than nothing.
The final deal will spend $110 million to extend direct payments to providers for another year. Starting in mid-2026 It will direct $65 million to providers who join a proposed “School Readiness Program” — similar to 4-year-old kindergarten (4K) but distinct from current 4K programs.
The deal also will add $123 million to increase the reimbursement for child care costs for low-income families under the Wisconsin Shares program. 
The agreement was reached Monday in negotiations involving Gov. Tony Evers, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton).
Kids Forward labeled the child care provisions “significant, but not sufficient, wins for Wisconsin’s working families.” Kids Forward is a policy and advocacy organization for low-income families and families of color.
“This deal doesn’t address the long-term needs of families and providers, but we look forward to working with legislators and the Governor to ensure sustained investment,” said Daithi Wolfe, senior policy analyst for Kids Forward, in a statement Tuesday.
‘Bridge’ payment program
The $110 million in direct payments to providers over the next 12 months will serve as a “bridge” after the end of Child Care Counts, the subsidy program funded with federal pandemic relief money that runs out this month.
Originally paying out $20 million a month, Child Care Counts helped stabilize the child care sector according to research reviewing the program, helping providers increase wages without having to charge parents more.
The money was cut in half two years ago, and since then providers have reported having to raise fees and, in some cases, reduce their capacity because they lacked enough child care workers. A survey report earlier this year found that 25% of providers said they might close if state payments stop.
The new payment program is intended to enable providers to plan and budget between now and July 2026 for the loss of Child Care Counts. It will be funded with interest income on the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds the Evers administration received starting in early 2021.
“The disappointing part is it’s not permanent,” said Ruth Schmidt, executive director of the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association (WECA). WECA has campaigned all year for Gov. Tony Evers’ original proposal, which sought $480 million including for continuing monthly provider subsidies.
“This is not going to be the sort of panacea for child care,” Schmidt said. “We will still see child care programs needing to raise rates. We will likely still see closures throughout the year. But I think we will see them at much lower rates, and I think that’s a really good thing for child care.”
Schmidt praised Evers as a “champion for children” and also credited GOP leaders for being “willing to sit down” and negotiate. “I think bipartisanship has been at play in this,” she said.
A 4K-style program
The new Early School Readiness Program for 4-year-olds is a response to the impact that 4K expansion has had on child care providers. As 4K programs expanded in Wisconsin elementary schools, “that pulled a lot of 4-year-olds out of child care,” Schmidt said.
The new School Readiness Program will set curriculum standards and require child care workers who teach in it to have at least an associate degree. Schmidt said that for child care providers who participate, it will “ensure that child care has more opportunities to continue to serve 4-year-olds.”
Child care providers who take part will for the first time receive direct payments from state funds.
“Child care as an industry has long been very interested in finding out how to continue to do the services that they know are so important for 4-year-olds in their programs, and I think this is a mechanism that will allow for that,” Schmidt said.  “This is a net gain of $65 million in state general purpose revenue into child care. That’s a big thing.”
Providers view deal skeptically 
For some child care providers, however, the details of the budget deal fall short of what they contend their sector needs.
The $110 million bridge program “is less than we’re getting right now, and we can’t keep teachers and we can’t keep prices down the way it is,” said Corrine Hendrickson, a New Glarus child care provider. She doesn’t expect it to achieve its stated goal of increasing the number of teachers along with accessibility and affordability in child care.
Brooke Legler, another New Glarus provider, said the $480 million that Evers had originally sought translated to keeping child care workers’ wages at $13 an hour on average. “This doesn’t even do that,” she said of the bridge program.
Hendrickson and Legler are cofounders of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), a coalition of parents and providers that also campaigned actively for the original Evers proposal.
Hendrickson said she’s concerned that the School Readiness Program will be perceived by parents as “less academic, less school, less quality than the free option at the public school.”
Legler questions whether the new program as structured will succeed in drawing more families of 4-year-olds who would otherwise send their children to 4K. School districts have expanded their 4K programs to all day schedules in part because of a lack of child care, she said.
“I think that’s such a disservice that we have … closed door negotiations and that we’re not including the people at the table that need to be at the table, especially if we want to have effective and efficient policies that work for Wisconsin,” Legler said.
Both Legler and Hendrickson said they’re also concerned about a provision creating a “large family center” category with up to 12 children. Currently there are family centers with up to eight children and group centers with nine or more children.
Another provision would lower the minimum age for entry-level child care workers to 16. Both the age change and the large family provision were in bills that Republicans introduced in the 2023-24 legislative session and that providers mostly opposed.
“That’s not an answer. That doesn’t do anything financially” to help providers, Legler said.
“We have people making life-altering decisions for many people in Wisconsin, yet they have no experience or expertise on the matter,” she said. “This method does not work.”

(Photo: Ray Di Pietro)State attorneys are seeking to dismiss a lawsuit over Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban after a new law adding limited exceptions for medical emergencies went into effect earlier this year.
Jenna Adamson, assistant solicitor general in Tennessee’s Office of the Attorney General, told a three-judge panel Tuesday that the new law “made significant changes” to Tennessee’s abortion ban and “makes this a different case.” She argued the lawsuit is now moot.
But attorneys with the Center for Reproductive Rights countered the new legislation, effective April 29, is written in vague and ambiguous language that still leaves doctors uncertain if they are following or breaking the law when providing an emergency abortion. Doctors found to have violated Tennessee’s abortion law face the revocation of their licenses and lengthy prison sentences.
“This really leaves us in no different place than we were before,” said Nicolas Kabat, a staff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. 
The fear Tennessee physicians have that they will be prosecuted for providing life-saving abortions, and the fear patients have that they will be denied them “have not changed one bit,” as a result of the new law, Kabat said.
Judges temporarily block discipline of doctors who perform emergency abortions in Tennessee

The lawsuit, originally filed in 2023, represents seven Tennessee women denied emergency abortions and two physicians who say they fear criminal prosecution for providing lifesaving care. The American Medical Association joined the challenge in March. 
Tennessee’s abortion ban went into effect in 2022. 
A year later, lawmakers amended the legislation to include a “medical condition exception.”  
The 2023 exception says a doctor may perform an abortion “using reasonable medical judgement, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time” if the abortion is necessary to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or to “prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”  The legislation also added molar and ectopic pregnancies as exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.  It was this 2023 legislation the lawsuit initially challenged as overly vague.
In 2024, the three-judge panel presiding over the case temporarily blocked the state’s medical board from disciplining doctors for providing emergency abortions. 
Their ruling also outlined four specific pregnancy-related conditions that qualify as “medical necessity” exceptions to the state’s abortion ban, noting the “confusion and lack of consensus within the Tennessee medical community on the circumstances requiring necessary health- and life-saving abortion care.” 
Three judge panel hears arguments over ‘unconstitutionally vague’ exceptions to abortion ban

That temporary injunction remains in place. 
This year  lawmakers further amended the state’s abortion ban to say doctors “may” provide an abortion for certain conditions that mirror those outlined in the panel’s temporary injunction. 
Those exceptions include:  previable preterm premature rupture of membranes (the rupture of the amniotic sac before a fetus is viable); inevitable abortion; severe preeclampsia; mirror syndrome associated with fetal hydrops (a life threatening build up of fluid); and an infection that can result in uterine rupture or loss of fertility. The 2025 legislation also specifically says mental health diagnoses may not be used as an exception to the state’s abortion ban.
The three-judge panel hearing arguments Tuesday were Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal, Judge Sandra Donaghy and Chancellor Kasey Cullbreath gave no timeline on when they will issue a decision about whether the case will move forward or be dismissed. 
Moskal said they would “issue our ruling as soon as we are able to do so.”

But t[...]","Getty ImagesAt a ceremony to commemorate “Michigan Reunification Day,” Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh said:
Through coordination between courts and child welfare professionals, parents who are struggling and need support in order to reunify with their children are given opportunities in family courts to be met with opportunity, not punishment.
But the data tell a different story:

In Michigan, if you are torn from the arms of your parents and consigned to the chaos of foster care, the odds are nearly two in three that you are never going home – unless you manage to find your parents again once you are an adult. Michigan reunifies only 35% of the children it takes. Only four states are worse.
Michigan is so hostile to families that more children are adopted, usually by total strangers, than return to their own homes – only three other states share that distinction.
Michigan is so hostile to reunification that it would rather let children age out of foster care with no home at all at a rate nearly double the national average than make the effort to reunify more families.
Some states with dismal reunification rates say they make up for it by placing more children in guardianships with extended families.  Michigan can’t even make that claim. In Michigan, children exit to guardianship or some other living arrangement with a relative at a rate less than half the national average.

Of course, some might find this cause for celebration; after all, when we hear about child abuse we usually hear about horror stories. But such cases represent a tiny fraction of what caseworkers see.
In Michigan, 73% of the time, when children are forced into foster care, there is not even an allegation of sexual abuse or any form of physical abuse. In 58% of cases, there is not even an allegation of drug or alcohol abuse.
In contrast, 40% of cases involve housing or homelessness. In Michigan, far more children are taken away because of housing issues than for physical or sexual abuse combined.
The problem with all this is not that it hurts parents, though of course it does, the problem is that it hurts children.
Think back to when children were torn from their mothers’ arms at the Mexican border during the first Trump administration; listen again to their cries. Though Michigan caseworkers almost always mean well, when children are taken in Michigan, they cry out the same way for the same reason. So it’s no wonder study after study finds that in the typical cases, not the horror stories, children left in their own homes typically fare better even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care.
But the harm doesn’t stop there. Multiple studies find abuse in one-quarter to one-third of family foster homes, and the rate of abuse in group homes and institutions is even worse. Many children pass through more than one foster home. So that child taken because of housing problems faces frightening odds of being abused in foster care itself.
The fact that in Michigan, foster care is a point of no return for so many children should come as no surprise. It reflects decades of failure. For example: Federal law requires states to make “reasonable efforts” to keep families together. If a judge doesn’t certify this was done, the state’s expenses on the case are ineligible for federal reimbursement. But a 2005 study found that 40 percent of Michigan judges admitted they lied and said “reasonable efforts” were made in cases where the judges really didn’t believe it.
Instead of courtroom theatrics, the state Department of Health and Human Services and the courts need to finally get serious about stopping needless removal and ensuring swift, safe  reunification when removal is genuinely the only option. It’s not that hard and it’s not that expensive.  Multiple studies demonstrate that even small amounts of cash assistance can dramatically reduce what agencies like DHHS call “neglect.”
In addition, every family needs high-quality legal representation from the moment they come under any form of scrutiny from DHHS. No, that’s not to get “bad parents” off. It’s to protect children from being forced needlessly into foster care by finding alternatives to cookie-cutter “service plans” often churned out by DHHS. This approach is proven to safely reduce needless foster care. In many cases, the federal government will pay half the cost, and savings from reduced foster care are likely to cover the rest. There are several such programs in Michigan, but it needs to be available statewide. At a minimum, Michigan needs to enact a key recommendation of the Child Protection Legal Representation Task Force to create an office to set minimum standards for such representation.
Because while DHHS and the courts proclaim a single Michigan Reunification Day, the truth is, in Michigan, every day is family destruction day.

The episode is the latest sign of turmoil in public defense since Gov. Jeff Landry and legislators reworked state laws to give Landry more control over its attorneys and finances. 

State Public Defender Rémy Starns, a Landry appointee, hired new local chief public defenders to take over from five he is seeking to oust this week. By doing so, he sidestepped Louisiana’s Public Defender Oversight Board that is expected to weigh in on whether to stop the terminations next week. 
The public defender board has already attempted to convene twice in the last two weeks to vote on whether to block Starns from dismissing the attorneys. The board hasn’t been able to gather enough members to legally hold a meeting and vote, in large part because six of nine board members have resigned since the end of May. Two board spots still remain vacant. 
“Obviously the four of us who are here would like to get this matter concluded. Unfortunately, we don’t have that authority without having a quorum,” said retired Judge Paul deMahy, one of the governor’s appointees to the board, after a failed attempt to meet and vote Monday. 
Starns did not return phone calls and texts about this story sent to his cell phone Monday and Tuesday. 

He and the board have been in an escalating battle over how much control Starns has over the local chiefs ever since Landry’s public defender overhaul laws went into effect last year.

Louisiana’s sprawling public defense network includes 850 attorneys who represent 146,000 people annually, accounting for approximately 88% of all criminal defendants in the state. They are supervised by 36 chief public defenders who are, in turn, overseen by Starns. 
Starns has been the state public defender since 2020, when former Gov. John Bel Edwards recommended him for the job. He was the rare state appointee who was kept in his position when Landry came into office.  

He helped the new Republican governor push through law changes that dissolved the former public defender board and created a new, weaker board over which Landry has more influence. The board also has less authority over Starns in its reworked form.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

In March, a few months after the public defender law changes took effect, Starns announced he would not renew the contracts of five chiefs. They had all testified in opposition to Starns’ policies during hearings with the board and state lawmakers. 

The chief public defenders who have been targeted are Michelle AndrePont in Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson in Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller in Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward in Evangeline Parish and John Hogue who works in Madison, Tensas and East Carroll parishes. 
Their annual contracts expired Monday. Starns sent notice of their replacements to them Monday afternoon after 3 p.m., less than 24 hours before the new attorneys were expected to take over the ousted chiefs’ responsibilities. 

Three of the five ousted lawyers said they did not have a chance to talk to the interim chiefs who were taking over the offices before they started work Tuesday. 

“I think it’s unfortunate that we have this chaos, unnecessary chaos, created by the state public defender’s actions,” Hogue said in an interview Monday night. 
Pamela Grady, who works as the attorney for the city of Tallulah, took over for Hogue as the interim public defender director in a large swath of rural northeast Louisiana. She could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Brunson, another ousted chief, said the public defender office for Natchitoches Parish has been leased personally by him and doubled as a private law office for several years. He wasn’t clear where the local public defender’s office space would be starting Tuesday or where the office’s old files should be sent since he was being displaced. 

“I’m going to go to my office tomorrow and wait for [the interim chief public defender] to show up,” Brunson said Monday night. 

James Calhoun, who contracts as a private attorney with the Winn Parish public defender’s office, was tapped to take over for Brunson. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 

Chad Guillot, who is the chief public defender in Avoyelles Parish, will be doubling up and also running the Rapides Parish office as the interim chief instead of Fuller. He isn’t interested in the permanent Rapides job because he intends to run for district attorney in Avoyelles Parish in 2026. 

“I know it is only going to be until they find a permanent chief,” Guillot said Tuesday. “That can take some time. I’ll serve until they find someone permanent — in one month or six months.” 

Guillot and Fuller planned to meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the transition. He could not meet Tuesday morning because he had to be in court in Avoyelles, he said. 

In Caddo, AndrePont’s longtime deputy, Mary Harried, is serving as the interim chief. Harried has nearly three decades of public defender experience and said the transition was going smoothly Tuesday afternoon but she does not intend to take the job permanently. 

“I have a great deal of respect for Michelle [AndrePont]. We have been friends and colleagues for 27 years,” she said. “I love her. If she comes back, we’re good.” 
Christopher Ludeau took over for Ward in Evangeline Parish, where he contracts as a private attorney with the public defender office. Ward declined to comment and Ludeau could not be reached at his private law office Tuesday.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
Controversial compensation
In addition to the five dismissals, Starns has issued controversial contracts to the rest of the chiefs who he is keeping. The agreements allow him to fire them at any time for any reason, and give him total control over their pay. 

A state law passed as part of Landry’s public defender overhaul in 2024 dictates that the public defender board sets the compensation level of chief public defenders, but Starns has included a provision in the chiefs’ individual contracts requiring them to waive the right to the board’s payscale. 
Starns has tried to get the board to approve his preferred pay plan for the chiefs three times in the last year, but the board has rejected his proposal, primarily because it would cut some chief public defenders’ pay by tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, they adopted a different compensation scale that has been used since 2023.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gavel-scales-justice-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 07:05:30.500466

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
This might lead to the nonprofit regaining the ability to send used books to incarcerated people in DOC facilities around the state. Meanwhile, WBTP says it has experienced an issue with packages of new books, which were not banned, being sent back. 
Last year, the department enacted a used book ban. The DOC has cited concerns about drug smuggling, leading to scrutiny of how effective the ban might be and whether the impact on prisoners’ access to books was justified. Camy Matthay of Wisconsin Books to Prisoners told the Examiner in September that the ban hobbles the project. 
The agency said in late September that it used to make an exception for WBTP to send used books “due to the organization being based in Wisconsin with leadership who were responsive and willing to work with DOC.” Wardens and librarians could accept used books from certain trusted sources for donation to the institution libraries. 
In late September, the DOC said that under a  policy announced  in January, the department could no longer accept used books from anyone — including WBTP. The department said  “that policy is now being enforced when it comes to library donations as well as books sent to persons in our care.”
In March, the Examiner reported on concerns regarding mail between incarcerated people and attorneys, including the question of the accuracy of the drug tests used on materials coming into prisons.
According to incident reports and a statement from the DOC in late September, three separate shipments in February and March 2024 that were allegedly from Wisconsin Books to Prisoners had multiple items testing positive for drugs.  
In an email to Wisconsin Books to Prisoners in August, Sarah Cooper, former administrator of the DOC’s division of adult institutions, said the concern was not with WBTP but with people who would impersonate the nonprofit. 
“Unfortunately, those who wish to send drugs into the prisons do so under the guise of legitimate agencies, organizations and even legal entities,” Cooper said. 
WBTP said the group expects to be formally approved to resume shipping new and used donated books to people incarcerated throughout Wisconsin upon the successful completion of the second phase of the pilot. 
“We are cautiously optimistic that WBTP will be back or close to our full operations by September 2025,” the nonprofit said in a statement Friday. 
WBTP said it has participated in a pilot program at Oakhill Correctional Institution over the past few months. The nonprofit said that during phase one, it sent three packages of books, one third of which were used books. The books were added to the library collection, making them available for checkout by those who requested them. 
The pilot program aims to allow DOC to test and refine its screening process for donated reading materials to ensure safety, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke said in an email to the Examiner.
Starting July 1, WBTP will be able to send requested materials directly to individuals at Oakhill Correctional Institution instead of the institution library, Hardtke said. 
“The goal is to eventually allow WBTP to send reading materials to individuals at any DOC facility — safely,” Hardtke said. She mentioned a safety concern about people coming into contact with intoxicating substances. 
In a statement in late September, the department said staff reviewed contraband incident reports that facility staff had flagged as drug-related between Jan. 1 2019 and Sept. 19, 2024. 
The DOC said that not all incident reports flagged as drug-related turn out to be drug-related, and that “some drug-related incidents recorded through a medical record or conduct report may not be reflected in these numbers.” 
The department said there had been 214 incidents of drugs being found on paper from Jan. 1 2019 to Sept. 18, 2024  “including in books and letters shipped to DOC facilities.”
WBTP said it was told by DOC that it would continue mailing brand-new books to meet requests made by readers. Many of those packages have been returned to them, WBTP said. The status of some packages is not known, and the nonprofit is investigating the issue. In its statement, WBTP said it has “engaged in discussions” with DOC administrative staff, “in opposition to their policy banning the donation of used reading materials.”
“WBTP remains committed to pursuing every possible avenue to challenge this censorship,” the nonprofit said.

Thousands of Arkansas educators will open their mailboxes this summer to find checks of $1,500 to $10,000 as a reward for high student performance and improved outcomes during the 2024-25 school year.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Department of Education announced last week that 4,200 educators qualified for bonuses under the Learns Merit Teacher Incentive Fund Program, which launched in 2023 as part of a major education reform bill. Roughly 3,000 educators received checks during the program’s first year.

“It’s neat to see how surprised [teachers] are, because they think that everybody’s working just as hard as they are, and that all the students are learning as much as their students,” said Jacob Oliva, Arkansas’ secretary of education. “It’s a special moment to really celebrate some of the best of the best.”
This year’s $14 million in bonus pay from the state is meant to incentivize, recruit and retain high-performing educators while reducing staff shortages, according to the department. But the state’s largest teachers union says too many educators are left out of the running for the annual salary boost.
To be eligible, educators have to meet a complex list of requirements, including having three years of experience and either spending 70% of their time in the classroom or working as a librarian or school counselor.
Classroom teachers have to demonstrate growth in their students’ state test results and be ranked as effective or higher in the Arkansas Teacher Excellence and Support System, based on district evaluations of factors like quality of instruction, classroom environment and student engagement.
Educators who don’t have student state assessment data — such as those specializing in subjects not tested, like fine arts — have to be rated highly effective.
Finally, qualifying teachers must rank in the top 25% of student growth scores, based on a three-year average of English language arts, math or science state tests; teach in a critical shortage area; or mentor college students to become teachers.
Bonus amounts depend on which criteria educators meet. A teacher can receive $9,000 for ranking in the top 1% in student growth, while a counselor could receive $1,500 for working in a geographic shortage area. Bonuses can reach $10,000.
But April Reisma, president of the Arkansas Education Association, said many high-performing teachers are left out.
“I’m a special education teacher. One time in my life I’ve had a student that hit ‘exceeding’ on that test,” she said. “I’ve been a great teacher, and I’ve consistently got [highly effective] on my test evaluations, but I may or may not get that bonus, depending on whether or not my kids had a great day. It’s all based on a test at the end of the year for that growth. The results of one test are not an accurate indicator of how a student is performing.”

The legislation that created the merit pay program also eliminated bonuses for national board certified teachers, a recognition that educators can receive after meeting rigorous standards. Reisma said certified teachers used to receive annual bonuses of $10,000, but those dwindled to $2,500 by the end of last year.
Lawmakers and state officials have said the bonus program’s many qualifications were intended to reward, retain and recruit educators who have a significant impact, such as producing outstanding student growth, teaching in short-staffed schools and mentoring future teachers.
“The program is designed to target those specific things, and from my perspective, has done a good job of providing significant additional compensation in those areas, and is likely to improve recruitment and retention across all three of those areas,” said Josh McGee, a professor with the University of Arkansas Office for Education Policy. The university is partnering with the state to implement the program.
The effectiveness of performance-based pay has varied over the years, with earlier programs lacking in impact and more recent attempts producing positive results.
While Arkansas’ program is state-funded, the federal government has awarded merit pay grants to school districts for nearly two decades. Texas, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., have implemented performance pay programs over the years with mixed results.
Federal funding for teacher incentives was eliminated this spring with the Trump administration’s efforts to scrap diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The university will conduct research on the Arkansas program’s effectiveness in the coming years. McGee said an initial analysis will most likely take place in the fall, but an overall study won’t happen for a few years.

Today is a day to mourn. Two firefighters responding to a brush fire at Coeur d’Alene’s Canfield Mountain were shot dead and a third badly injured. Their names and photos were released:

As the horror unfolded, we learned that the alleged shooter started the fire to draw in the unsuspecting responders and later died of a self-inflicted wound. More troubling is the news that the suspected perpetrator was a 20-year-old male. His name was Wess Roley.
We may never know the motives of this individual, but what we do know is that a very young person at the beginning of his life was consumed by rage and went down a dark path. And once again, we’re pressed with the hard question: Why?
  This is a screenshot of a picture from Wess Roley’s Instagram account, which is no longer up. Photo courtesy of the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office)
Within the forests of the Pacific Northwest lurks a generous share of far-right extremists and white nationalists, and North Idaho has drawn the spotlight too many times. Given this history, national media immediately jumped to portray the incident as potential terrorism or perhaps another saga of North Idaho lawlessness and white supremacy.
But while extremist voices in the Inland Northwest are spinning this event in ways that are politically-motivated, focus should remain on the perilous journey of this alleged suspect’s youth and others like him.
Before a 20-year-old man lights a fire to execute firefighters, there is a younger boy who was drawn into this violent trajectory. Is it mental illness, family dynamics, bullying or something else?
What we do know is that many young people today feel hopeless, neglected and unloved. When young people are lonely and isolated, they become vulnerable to unhealthy alliances in the form of a substitute “family” that offers a connection they have not found elsewhere. Once absorbed into a group that uses hate and violence to secure loyalty, a young person is more likely to become part of yesterday’s headlines.
We must be mindful that the sheltered years of the COVID epidemic transformed the lives of young people in unprecedented ways. They were deprived of social time with friends and normal “rights-of-passage,” such as graduation ceremonies and public acknowledgement.
Some young adults say they feel disenfranchised, the critical pieces of their growing up years forever lost. Adding to the mix was a slow economic recovery and shifting employment options that created anxieties older adults never had to bear.
Social media, while exposing youth to vast amounts of information, can feed isolation and create echo chambers where bullying takes root and fragile self esteem can be toppled with a photo.
 Our youth are struggling

We need to recognize that our youth are struggling. A key piece of solving this problem lies not in seeking justice after incidents have happened, but in prevention through belonging. According to a 2021 study from the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a strong sense of belonging and connectedness is among the most effective protective factors against youth violence and radicalization.
Donations now accepted for victims in North Idaho firefighter shooting ambush

The U.S. Surgeon General has similarly identified the “epidemic of loneliness” as a critical driver of mental health crises and community harm. In short: When young people feel like they belong, they are less likely to cause harm — to themselves or our communities. 
Idaho for ALL, a coalition of citizens working to push back on hate and violence, is a proud partner of the Idaho Healthy Communities Challenge, a statewide initiative in collaboration with Boise State University and the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights.
This project aims to prevent youth and young adult violence by addressing root causes, like social isolation, lack of purpose and community disconnection, before the harm is unleashed. This is accomplished by listening to young people, building spaces where they can thrive and supporting the adults who care for them.
As we gather for Fourth of July barbecues and fireworks, let’s pay attention to our young people. Be aware of isolated individuals. Talk to them. Ask questions. Show interest. Give them space to talk about this tragedy. Invite them into conversations that matter. Let them know they don’t have to have it all figured out to be loved, accepted and valued. These small moments of presence can be life changing.
When young people feel genuinely seen and supported, they are more likely to ask for help, to take healthy risks and to reject harmful paths. Belonging isn’t created through one conversation. It’s built through a culture of care, consistency and inclusion. Each of us has the power to contribute to that culture, starting now, right where we are.

(Photo by Andy Sacks/Getty Images)A Pennsylvania-based prison healthcare company is suing the state claiming Tennessee officials refused to award it a contract without explanation, a move that risks “destroying” the state’s competitive bidding process.
Wexford Health Sources filed the lawsuit in Davidson County Chancery Court in May, saying the state declined to give it a contract valued at roughly $100 million for health care and behavioral health services in Tennessee prisons even though it scored higher than two other companies in the bidding process. 
The lawsuit targets the Department of Correction, Commissioner Frank Strada, the state’s Central Procurement Office and its director, Mike Perry.
Wexford says in the filing the state was prepared to award it the contract for inmate health care and behavioral services until Centurion, which holds the contract, challenged the decision in February. The state then notified Wexford it would send out new requests for proposals without offering a reason, as required by law, the filing says.

The state’s primary defenses are that Wexford has no standing to file suit and that the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter. An August hearing is scheduled to consider a state request to dismiss the lawsuit.
The state’s filing also says the plaintiff’s challenge fails because it contests “a lawful and discretionary decision” before the contract was awarded.
In contrast, Wexford’s challenge says state law obligates public contracting officials to “fairly and honestly” consider bids. Otherwise, competitive bidding “will be undermined” and vendors will be “discouraged” from submitting bids.
It also says Tennessee law recognizes “that rejecting all bids and canceling a solicitation ‘should be the exception in government procurement rather than the rule.’” 
Wexford’s filing further says the state “stands on the precipice of destroying any semblance of competition in the award of the contract.”
Wexford’s primary argument is that it was graded higher than Centurion and YesCare (formerly Corizon) in the state’s bidding process. Yet just before it was to receive the contract, Centurion protested the award and the Department of Correction called for another set of bids.
The March decision marked the second time in recent years the state opted to stick with Centurion and take new bids after the other two companies were to be awarded the contracts. The first time state officials were set to award the contract to YesCare, but reneged on that in 2024, then reversed course on the Wexford contract award this March.
The state’s Fiscal Review Committee extended Centurion’s contract in May because of the litigation.
Corizon, which held Tennessee’s inmate behavioral health contracts from 2012 to 2020, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Department of Correction five years ago saying the state skewed the bidding process to help Centurion win the contract. That case was settled with prejudice in January 2022.
Documents from that lawsuit led the U.S. Department of Justice to charge two men, former Tennessee Department of Correction Deputy Commissioner Wes Landers and Centurion executive Jeffrey Wells, with bid-rigging in connection with the prison system contract. 
Landers took a job with Centurion after the contract bidding. The company fired both men before the lawsuit settlement, and Landers was found dead in September 2024.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton pushed for Centene’s Rhythm Health, formerly connected with Centurion, to win a TennCare contract for managed care services after it failed to succeed in bidding in 2021. Sexton sponsored a bill that would have required TennCare to add a fourth contractor, but it failed to pass.

(Photo courtesy Stephanie Cooper)Very few places exemplify our country’s shameful health disparities as much as Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley.”
Notorious for its toxic air and alarmingly high cancer rates, this petrochemical hub between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is where oil, gas and chemical corporations make their profitable products at the expense of the local population.
It’s a moral disgrace that neither Louisiana’s government nor the federal government has acted with urgency to end this well known injustice. Even United Nations human rights experts have condemned the environmental racism driving the poisoning of Cancer Alley, whose residents are disproportionately poor, Black or both.
Local communities have done their best to fill these gaps. People living near polluting facilities like those in Cancer Alley have started using pollution measuring equipment to monitor air quality in their communities for themselves. This is an example of “citizen science,” where the collection of scientific data is crowdsourced.
But lawmakers in Louisiana and beyond are trying to quash this work.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A law enacted in Louisiana last year requires that all air monitoring data that is shared publicly be collected using EPA-approved equipment. But EPA-approved air monitoring equipment has a price tag of $791,000 apiece — and needs more than $200,000 a year for operation and maintenance. It’s simply out of reach for the impoverished communities suffering the worst pollution.
Even worse, the law says that sharing data collected using any other equipment can be punished by fines of $32,500 a day — escalating to $1 million if the violation is done “intentionally, willfully or knowingly.”
The law is specifically targeted toward community air monitoring “for the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance with the federal Clean Air Act, Louisiana Environmental Quality Act, or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation for which the state has primary enforcement authority.”
But now, residents of the most polluted communities in Louisiana are fighting back in federal court. Community groups — including groups based in Cancer Alley, such as Rise St. James, the Descendants Project, and the Concerned Citizens of St. John — are suing the state, alleging a violation of their First Amendment rights.
The law is clearly an assault on the ability of communities to advocate for themselves. It’s not an isolated example either, but part of a longstanding pattern of government serving wealthy interests by restricting the ability of marginalized communities to protect their air, water, land, and livelihoods.
In a 2020 report, my colleague Gabrielle Colchete and I documented a similar pattern with laws to stifle dissent, which are now on the books in 22 states, including Louisiana. At the time, we looked at states that were pushing increasingly harsh laws against people who protest fossil fuel infrastructure. We did detailed case studies (including one on Louisiana) of the political interests pushing for these laws and the environmental justice campaigners the laws were targeting.
Laws attacking citizen science should be viewed similarly. And in fact these laws work together.
When powerful corporations use their allies in government to block communities from being able to advocate for themselves, they have no other avenue for change except protest — which is then restricted by anti-protest bills.
While these are alarming trends in general, they are particularly alarming today with an increasingly authoritarian White House that’s waging an ideological attack against the very idea of environmental justice. The Trump administration has censored environmental justice data on government websites and eliminated environmental justice programs at both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Justice.
Given this political environment, there’s a real danger of laws attacking community air monitoring spreading to other states — a similar bill passed the West Virginia assembly last year before failing in the state Senate — and eventually being taken up by Congress.
Bad ideas, especially ones that benefit the wealthy and powerful, often spread far and wide. If we value clean air, clean water, and democracy, we need to be vigilant, and to fight back.

The owners of a Memphis-based health clinic MedPartners and SarJo Pharmacy purported to treat injured United States Postal Service employees, billing the cost of medications to the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA), according to an indictment filed June 12.
But the medication was never prescribed to patients, and the majority of the medications were not carried in stock by the pharmacy. About 500 of the 4,052 claims billed by SarJo Pharmacy between August 2018 and August 2021 were for drugs that were never actually manufactured or available to be purchased, the indictment states.
Collierville residents Kossie Lamon Simmons, 59, and Katina Marzie Simmons, 48, face charges of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, alongside 47-year-old Memphis resident Tritia Margalizita Townsend, who served as SarJo Pharmacy’s pharmacist in charge.
Between August 2018 and December 2021, FECA paid the pharmacy about $16.3 million. 
“Kossie, Katina and Townsend personally profited from their participation in the scheme by receiving fraud proceeds for the personal use and benefit of themselves and others,” the indictment states.
The trio are among 324 defendants facing charges as part of the U.S. Department of Justice’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, according to Interim U.S. Attorney Joseph C. Murphy, Jr. The operation targeted those with alleged involvement in health care fraud and illegal drug diversion schemes throughout the United States. 
Indictment details alleged scheme
Kossie Simmons controlled and managed MedPartners, a health clinic founded in 2016 with locations in Memphis, Nashville, and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to the indictment filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. Kossie Simmons also controlled and managed SarJo Pharmacy, which was founded in 2018 and had one location in Memphis. 
Katina Simmons managed and held 70% ownership interest in both companies. 
The indictment mentions an unnamed co-conspirator that held 30% ownership interest in both companies. Kossie Simmons, who previously pleaded guilty to health care fraud in 2007 and was barred from participating in any federal health care program for 25 years, exchanged text messages with the co-conspirator in August 2016.
“Been patiently waiting for the planets to come back into alignment from my first go round, now can attack this opportunity with the most valuable weapon of all EXPERIENCE,” Kossie Simmons wrote in one text message, according to the indictment. 
Katina Simmons enrolled MedPartners as a billing agent for the FECA program in August 2016, and enrolled the clinic as a physician office in the program in 2017, though Kossie Simmons was specifically barred from participating in a federal health care program.
SarJo Pharmacy opened in 2018 with Townsend as the only employed pharmacist. Townsend worked one day each week for four hours filling prescriptions for lidocaine and diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat pain, the indictment states.
The Tennessee Board of Pharmacy began investigating the business in September 2020 and discovered the pharmacy was billing for prescription medications without valid prescription orders. Instead, two nurse practitioners who worked in MedPartners’ clinics would determine whether patients were eligible for compounded medications, or medicines created using drug ingredients “tailored to the needs of an individual patient,” according to the indictment.
Two other physicians who worked with MedPartners never authorized prescriptions for the medications billed, and the nurse practitioners did not have access to prescription pads, according to court documents.
Investigators executed search warrants on the businesses in August 2021. The businesses submitted 227 more claims between the searches and the end of that year, bringing in another $1.1 million in payments.
Kossie and Katina Simmons each face one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, which carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, if convicted. They also face seven counts of health care fraud, which carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, if convicted. 
Townsend faces one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud and three counts of health care fraud.

(Getty Images)While I should know better, I continue to be caught off-guard by the growing number of people throughout the nation and the state of West Virginia who can’t seem to see the forest for the trees. Historically, West Virginia has made the list of one of the poorest states in the union and continues to make that list — year after year, decade after decade, which just adds to the incredulity of the number of voters who continue to put in the most powerful positions to lead the state and her people the same candidates of the same ilk. They’ve been drinking the Kool-Aid long before the current powers that be in D.C. and in Charleston took office — now though, the consumption appears to be limitless. 
Following the repeat cycle that keeps West Virginia on that list is, without a doubt, the single most destructive element in moving us forward. And with the last presidential election and West Virginia’s gubernatorial election, our chances of being forever removed from that list continue to dwindle. Still, when asked (and here’s where it gets really unnerving), the majority of voters in the U.S. and in this state would, given the chance, elect the same leaders. 
How is that possible when these leaders are doing everything in their power to make certain that the marginalized among us — you know who they are — continue to receive as little help from the federal and state governments as possible? This segment of society is being scraped to the marrow. Every effort to make it to the top of a very slippery slope only brings about more change that is not in their favor, until they once again slide down to the bottom. It is impossible for those not marginalized to continue to ignore the marginalized. This segment of our society has no choice but to keep grabbing that rope that is thrown to them and that is already thin and try to make the climb again — and again. 
The definition of ignorant is that you simply don’t know. But how can you claim to be ignorant of a clear sign of intentional degradation of a growing segment of the population, when it is in clear view? And if you truly don’t know about the challenges, then let go of your claim to ignorance and educate yourself and then ask yourself what you can do to improve the lives of the less fortunate among us.
When the federal government eliminates programs that are in place to help the marginalized in our country, our states, and our communities we must step up to the plate and do what we can. This directive is not debatable. Mother Teresa said, “If you can’t feed a hundred people, then feed one.” And, “Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.” 
I recently read a work by Anne Lamott titled, “Somehow: Thoughts on Love.” The book forces the reader to confront uncomfortable truths, reminding us of our humanity. If you’re often left wondering how you can help those among us less fortunate, this book is filled with so many “can do” suggestions, and with such minimal effort. Yes, you can donate food to a food pantry or send your read books to the Appalachian Prison Book Project. Yes, you can write a check (no matter how minimal) to those who are suffering from the devastating recent floods in our state. And yes, you can discover what the charitable organizations are doing throughout your community and find a way to participate. In the end, each of us matters. It’s a shame that we’ve lost that most certain acknowledgment. 
Until we reinstate what we’ve lost politically, we must find a way — each of us — to make a conscious decision/effort to do what we can. We can’t keep turning away by suggesting that we don’t know that the problems exist. We can’t keep putting more and more weight on ignorance, when we know that we, in fact, know that these situations are front and center throughout our country, our states and our communities. Do something.
Make no mistake about it, this — all of this — is about politics. Perhaps it’s always been about politics, but never has the political scene been so fractured as to make certain that the underserved among us are becoming the first to be pushed so far to the edge that a plummet is on the horizon. We can’t let that happen. Stop leaning on ignorance and educate yourself and find a way to bring some dignity back to the people who suffer most.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/food-pantry-.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 06:00:21.456670

(KY Resist, Facebook)At first I wasn’t sure we ought to go. It was easy to imagine several ways this thing could go off the rails. But pretty soon we got clear. If there was going to be an anti-Trump rally in Manchester, we were going to be there.
We’d watched the massive protests in cities and towns around the country, none of them close to our home in Clay County. This was our chance to participate. Edmund threw two folding lawn chairs in the trunk of the car. I brought the signs.
In a downtown parking lot, we found a small group of young people unpacking boxes of snacks and bottled water. We set up in a small grassy area right in the middle of town. Gradually, one at a time, others joined us, adults of varying ages, men and women, some from around here, others from nearby towns. I counted about two dozen on our side.  
Meanwhile another group about the same size was gathering across the street. Much of the event turned out to be these two groups yelling at one another from across the road.  
From our side we chanted:
No hate, no fear
Everyone is welcome here
Hey Hey Ho Ho
Donald Trump has got to go
We sang “This Land is Your Land ” and “Which Side Are You On?”
We held up signs: 
Medicaid Cuts = Closed Hospitals 
Hillbillies Need Health Care, Too
Trump Gives to the Rich, Takes from the Poor
  Anne Shelby writes she counted about two dozen protesters at the anti-Trump demonstration in Manchester on June 27. (KY Resist, Facebook)
We had chants, songs and signs. They had flags and trucks.  They were gathered around a bright red pickup, parked as if aimed in our direction. There were other trucks, too, not parked, but in constant motion, driving past us up and down Main Street, Trump flags flying, going one way then turning around and coming back the other. It took us a few minutes to figure out that there weren’t as many trucks as there seemed to be, that we were seeing the same ones again and again. And again. 
The trucks, already loud, revved up even louder as they passed us. Some of the people in the trucks got loud, too. Some yelled, GO HOME! To which some of us replied, “We ARE home.” Other truckers shouted something else, which sounded like “other truckers,” but which started with M as in mother and F as in father. I have heard this expression many times in my life, but never so much as last Friday night. It was appropriate, I guess, since earlier in the week the president himself had dropped the F-bomb in a public statement about dropping bombs in Iran. One woman in our group, when they yelled obscenities at us, answered, “We love you.”
Two drivers with diesel engines released clouds of black smoke on our group as they passed. They were promptly pursued and arrested by the police, along with a gentleman in Proud Boy gear who started across the street towards our group and was escorted away by a policeman.
The Manchester police did an amazing, effective and important job. They made it possible for all of us on both sides of the street to exercise our right to protest, and they kept us safe.
There’s another KY Resist protest rally July 5 in London. I plan on being there. It’s a risky business, because Donald Trump has purposefully turned up the dial on anger, hate, fear, and the possibility of violence.   
Which  is — Hey Hey Ho Ho — all the more reason to resist.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them. 


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

A bill to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion in North Carolina public schools is now on Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s desk, where it faces a likely veto after months of heated debate. But for many educators who spoke out this spring as the bill advanced through the legislature, their concerns remain just as urgent. If it becomes law despite the veto, what will this mean for how they teach — and for the students they serve?  


Senate Bill 227, passed last week by the Republican-controlled General Assembly, prohibits instruction, training or professional development that promotes what lawmakers call “divisive concepts.” It would bar school districts from maintaining DEI-related offices, restrict hiring practices tied to equity efforts, and require public schools to certify annual compliance with the law.  


The educators quoted in this story spoke to NC Newsline during interviews in March, as the bill and others like it moved through the legislature. For them, the legislation represents not just a shift in policy but a potential disruption to how they build trust and connection with students.
“If we take away some of these strategies and materials that support engagement — where kids see themselves reflected in what we’re trying to teach — we’re going to lose the buy-in for why we want them to care, to try and to show up at school,” said Sarah Hill, a first-grade teacher at Banks Road Elementary School in Wake County. 
 Teaching in a gray area
Teachers say the bill’s vague language leaves them uncertain about what’s permitted and afraid of facing consequences for teaching topics related to race, gender or history, even when aligned with state standards.  


“The idea that we would educate students in a way that doesn’t acknowledge the world’s diversity is laughable,” said Kimberly Jones, North Carolina’s 2023 Teacher of the Year. “I have never found acknowledging the truth to be divisive. The problem is never in seeing the differences that exist in the world. The problem is when we turn a beautiful and amazingly complex spectrum of life into a ladder of hierarchy.”
While the bill allows for “impartial” discussions of controversial historical topics, some say it’s unclear how those boundaries will be interpreted — or enforced.  


Christina Cole, Wake NCAE President and a former educator, warned that the bill could impact student learning and school inclusivity. She argued that DEI programs are important for supporting marginalized students, particularly those from Black, LGBTQ, and bilingual communities.  
“Public schools are one of the few places in our democratic society where people come together across lines of difference,” Cole said. “It’s our responsibility as educators to welcome students and their families regardless of who they are or who they love.” 


Cole, who worked in Wake County’s Office of Equity Affairs from 2018 to 2022, said those initiatives directly improved student performance, especially for students in special education and for students of color. She warned the legislation could force teachers to remove welcoming classroom displays, restrict book selections and cut support services for diverse student populations. 
 Impact in the classroom


For Elliot Brody, a school counselor at Banks Road Elementary, the loss of DEI-focused professional development would take away critical tools for reaching vulnerable students.
“Diversity is representing all people — all walks of life, all colors, religions, different types of ability levels,” Brody said. “And inclusion is doing practices to make sure that everyone’s voice is heard.”   


He said DEI training gave him tools to better support students dealing with bullying, feeling left out or instability at home. Without that support, he worries some kids may no longer feel supported.
“We’re not trying to push anything onto anybody,” Brody said. “We’re trying to make things more possible for them to reach their potential.” 


The bill would prohibit awarding continuing education credit for DEI-related training and bar public schools from contracting with outside experts for such work.  


 Supporters say the bill promotes neutrality
Republican lawmakers say the legislation is meant to restore fairness and ideological neutrality in classrooms and aligns with a Jan. 29, 2025, executive order by President Donald Trump. 


Supporters argue DEI programs promote a worldview that “stifles opportunity” and “stokes division” by encouraging students to judge others based on race or sex.
“Children should learn in an environment free from discrimination and should not be taught divisive concepts such as that one race or sex is inherently superior to another,” Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, said in a statement to NC Newsline this past spring. 
“DEI enshrines discrimination into our public schools instead of eliminating it. It creates a toxic, divisive environment. We support its elimination and bringing fairness back to public schools.” 
 A question of representation 


Keiyonna Dubashi, founder and executive director of “Profound Ladies” — a nonprofit that supports educators of color — said the legislation could worsen longstanding racial disparities in North Carolina’s schools. With 80 percent of the state’s teachers identifying as white, Dubashi said DEI work is often about ensuring students see themselves reflected in their education — and in the adults who lead their classrooms.  


“If we don’t force folks to take another look at our talent pool,” she said, “we’re going to continue to see the workforce stay majority white, even though our student demographic is not a representation of that.” 


Dubashi said she didn’t learn about Black history until adulthood, a gap that left her questioning her own potential. “Sometimes I just wondered, can I achieve that? Is that possible?” she said. “Because you don’t see yourself in so many of the great stories.” 


The bill bans instruction that suggests people should feel guilt or discomfort because of their identity, or that meritocracy or American founding principles are inherently racist.
Dubashi said those restrictions leave little room to examine systemic inequality or help students understand their world. “It’s not divisive to welcome more voices and perspectives into the room,” she said. “If you don’t want diversity, then what do you want — the opposite of diversity?
 What happens next


Senate Bill 227 is one of three Republican-backed proposals approved last week that target DEI programs in K-12 schools, universities and state government. All three measures are now before Gov. Stein, who is expected to veto them.  


Senate Republicans have enough votes to override a veto, while House Republicans would need at least one Democrat to vote with them if all members are present.  


Jones, the former Teacher of the Year, said lawmakers should focus on policies that address students’ real needs. 
“There are many things that could happen to support our public schools,” she said. “I just don’t see how this bill is one of them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Jones-in-classroom.jpg,,,2025-07-02 06:00:21.456670

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)In July 2020, the Virginia Clean Economy Act went into effect, setting the commonwealth on a path towards zero-emissions in its energy production by 2050. The lofty goals were designed to combat climate change and prepare Virginia to fulfill future electricity demands. 
Now as the state grapples with energy needs that have expanded since the passage of the bill — and with looming changes to federal energy policy — there are questions about if, and how, the law should be changed.
Where it started
The law, first proposed by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, put Virginia ahead of the curve concerning decarbonization of the grid. It was voted into law largely across party lines with only a few Republicans joining Democrats, who held control of both chambers at the time. 
A foundational component of the law focuses on the state’s two largest utility companies: Dominion Energy, which serves 2.7 million customers in Virginia; and Appalachian Power Company that serves nearly 530,000 customers statewide. The law requires the companies to produce their energy from 100% renewable sources by 2045 and 2050, respectively.
Solar and offshore wind must make up two-thirds of energy production by 2035. VCEA mandated 16,100 MW of solar and onshore wind, 5,200 MW of offshore wind, 2,700 MW of energy storage capacity  be generated in the public interest.
To that end, Dominion is aiming to have 80% of its new power generation come from renewable energy sources in the next 15 years, distributed as follows:
Solar: 45%
Natural Gas: 20%
Battery Storage: 15%
Offshore Wind: 15%
Nuclear (Small Modular Reactors): 5%
Dominion is currently building the largest offshore wind projects in the country off the shores of Virginia Beach. The utility states the 2600 megawatt project will be able to power 660,000 homes at peak output. The cost of the project has steadily increased as construction progressed and now totals over $10 billion dollars, adding an estimated 43 cents to customers’ monthly bills. Dominion is required by the law to petition the SCC for approval of 5200MW of wind power by 2035; the offshore wind project will bring the company halfway to that goal.
The VCEA also ordered reductions in energy sales through efficiency programs. This was partially helped through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which brought in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state for efficiency programs through selling pollution credits over the cap of carbon emissions implemented on energy facilities. 
However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin removed the state from RGGI, claiming the cost that was ultimately added to utility bills was a tax on consumers. Courts have ruled his removal was unlawful. Virginia has not been added back into RGGI while appeals play out. It is likely the state’s membership in the program will not be determined until a new governor takes office in 2026.
“When the VCEA was initially passed, it was really about replacing power generation with newer, cleaner forms of power generation,” said Aaron Ruby, Director of Virginia and offshore wind media for Dominion Energy. “Today in Virginia, we’re not replacing generation. We’re adding new generation. We need as much power generation as we can get from every source.”
Since the implementation of the law, each year has benchmark requirements for Phase I and Phase II utilities to  use renewable energy. In 2026, Phase I utilities must be at 17% and Phase II must be at 29% otherwise they must buy renewable energy credits or face penalties of $45 per megawatt hour.
Dominion reports they have petitioned the SCC for 4500 MW of solar power of the 16100MW required by the VCEA. As for energy battery storage, Dominion has petitioned for 550 MW out of the 2700MW requirements.
Relatedly, in 2021, the General Assembly passed the Clean Cars Standard as part of the state’s goals of cutting emissions. The law mirrored California’s standard that banned the sale of gas-only cars after 2035. Virginia’s law ramped up percentages of new cars and trucks required to be zero emissions vehicles along the same time as California. 
The challenge
Since the VCEA was passed, Virginia’s electricity needs have exploded due to the construction of power-hungry data centers and more extreme temperatures that put a strain on the grid. Virginia is the home to over a third of the world’s data centers, with more being proposed across the state.
There is a growing concern as more come online that the cost of that energy use will ultimately land in the laps of consumers. Expanding the energy profile in the state through renewables is a slow-moving process, as county governments debate solar siting ordinances and where transmission lines should be built.
Republicans in the statehouse want to see more natural gas plants and small nuclear reactors built to meet the demand. They see gas as a more reliable energy source in extreme weather that creates more jobs than a solar farm would.
“This can’t really be a piecemeal approach. I think we really got to look at the whole scheme here that was put in place with the VCEA,” said Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery. “I think we’ve got to go back to the drawing board. I think the VCEA is totally unrealistic. It was implemented without really a plan to make it workable and that the cost of it is being passed on to consumers.”
Democrats acknowledge the fluidity of Virginia’s power needs but say the VCEA is still a valuable tool to help meet those needs responsibly. 
“We understood at the outset that we were setting a 30-year goal and that conditions and technology would change in ways we couldn’t anticipate in 2020. We knew that it would need to evolve and adapt, while keeping with the spirit of the legislation, and that we’d have to address those issues throughout the life of the law,” Sullivan said in a statement. “Indeed, we have made adjustments to the VCEA since it passed.”
The General Assembly has been unable to pass statewide regulations for solar farms and data centers. This has led to fierce debate in counties over whether both large scale solar farms and small community arrays should be allowed to be built. City and county officials also have had to determine rules for data centers as stress on local transmission lines becomes a growing concern.
“We can still achieve those targets through varying forms of solar, wind and storage, but because of the increased level of electrification across the state commonwealth, we need to plus-up on storage components,” said Jim Purekal, Director of Advanced Energy United, a group that was integral in passing the 2020 law.
Dominion has warned that with the increased demand they need to build multiple natural gas plants to serve during peak energy use times. Those plans, including a proposal to build a natural gas plant in Chesterfield, have often met community opposition since it would move the needle back on the carbon neutral goals the VCEA lays out. Others believe investing in energy storage is the right path to meet those peak demands.
“I don’t believe we have had a local government deny a permit for a solar project, we have seen counties impose various different limitations on solar development or restrictions for a certain project,” Ruby said. “At a certain point, we decided not to pursue a given project any further at least for the time being.”
What’s next
There have been numerous attempts to revise or outright repeal the VCEA. The latest attempts in the 2025 legislative session aimed to add hydrogen and fossil fuels to the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, expand nuclear power, lessening the requirements for emission reductions, and removing the financial incentives to comply with the RPS. All of those bills failed during the session.
“All of those efforts have been struck down, have been pushed to the side, in some cases haven’t even been considered or haven’t even been given a hearing… we’ve continued to try to get our colleagues to understand the problems that the VCEA has created and specifically how those hurt our constituents,” Obenshain said.
There have also been efforts to strengthen the law in its goals for emission reduction and meeting the power demand. Sullivan passed legislation this year that would expand power storage for the two large utility companies. 
“I tried to improve the VCEA during the last session of the General Assembly, with a bill that would have accelerated and expanded its energy storage provisions, enhancing reliability and helping to lower energy costs for Virginia’s families,” Sullivan noted. “But the Governor chose to veto it.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin first offered an amendment that completely repealed the VCEA, which the General Assembly ultimately rejected. The bill then met Youngkin’s veto pen. 
“Adding in requirements for the petitioning of additional storage technologies will not change the fact that the law is misguided and does not work. Long-duration energy storage is an expensive technology and if utilities believed it to be the best technology to meet demand, they would be actively seeking permission to build them,” Youngkin said in his veto message.
Advanced Energy United, an advocacy group that represents businesses and energy companies and lobbies for public policies on consumer costs and grid reliability, believes like Sullivan that more energy storage will enable the state to meet its energy demand in peak usage times or after storms.
As for the Clean Car Standard, its future is uncertain after President Donald Trump signed multiple bills to rescind the California law that Virginia’s legislation is tied to. The build out of electric vehicle charging stations in the state has also been put almost entirely on hold after funding for the projects was cut.
The state was set to receive $100 million over five years to build charging stations along every 50 miles of the interstate. Fifty-one of the 53 projects lost their funding, marking a significant setback for the state’s shift towards zero-emission vehicles.
Ruby said Dominion is one of many stakeholders invested in the implementation of the VCEA. With a new slate of legislators and a new governor coming in next year, the utility plans to meet with them to determine how to best move forward with the law.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)A Henrico County Circuit Court judge on Tuesday ordered that licensed counselors be allowed to engage underage clients in a controversial form of talk therapy about gender identity and sexual orientation that medical and mental health experts say can be harmful.
The case underpinning the new consent decree with the Virginia Department of Health Professions stemmed from a 2020 state law banning “any practice or treatment that seeks to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity.” Last year, Front Royal-based counselors John and Janet Raymond  challenged the ban. 
“The Raymonds desired to engage in talk therapy with minors through voluntary conversations, prayer, and providing written materials such as Scripture, but Virginia’s law and regulations prohibited them from doing so,” read a Tuesday statement from the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the Family Foundation’s legal arm that represented the Raymonds in the case. The Center hailed the court’s ruling as a “landmark free speech victory.”
Northern Virginia counselors challenge Virginia’s ban on conversion therapy

Conversion therapy entails attempts to change or influence a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The American Psychological Association has denounced conversion therapy, stating that it is not an accepted form of therapy based on medical or scientific evidence, as has the American Medical Association. The groups and advocates have also said conversion therapy is used as a tool to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people and lifestyles. 
Conversion therapy treatments have garnered national controversy over the years and range from inducing nausea, providing electric shocks to having people snap an elastic band around their wrist when they become aroused by same-sex erotic images or thoughts.
The Raymonds told the court they previously practiced talk therapy for conversion therapy clients, as they do with their other clients. The ban meant they couldn’t have conversations to try to guide clients away from embracing their sexual or gender identities. The new consent decree means they can practice conversion therapy again.
Opponents of the practice have argued that conversion therapy can put LGBTQ+ people at higher risk of mental health issues like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse or suicide. 
The Raymonds emphasized that the talk therapy they engage in with their clients is voluntary and stressed that nothing about their case should be construed as allowing any counselor to perform acts associated with conversion therapy, such as electro-shock therapy. 
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” said Josh Hetzler, the couple’s legal counsel with the Founding Freedoms Law Center. 
The Family Foundation is a Christian and conservative advocacy group and legal firm that opposes same-sex marriage, supports more parental input in public education, and supports increased restrictions on abortions. 
“We thank God that He gives us the freedom to speak, to believe, to seek His wisdom,” John Raymond said Tuesday in the Family Foundation’s office in Richmond — formerly a house that Confederate General Robert E. Lee rented following his surrender at Appomattox that ended the Civil War. 
Raymond said he felt like Virginia’s 2020 law gave him no choice but to challenge it and called it a “hostile ideological invasion within our country.”
Likewise, Hetzler noted a “growing number of parents” seeking counseling services with a religious lens for their children “in an era when gender dysphoria has become a contagion among young people.”
 Virginia lawmakers weigh in

Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, noted on a press call Tuesday that there have been bipartisan efforts to support LGBTQ constituents in Virginia’s legislature in recent years. When the conversion therapy ban was clearing the House of Delegates five years ago, 11 Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in voting for it. Seven Republican lawmakers — to include then-delegate and now Attorney General Jason Miyares — abstained from voting. Over in the Senate, a former GOP lawmaker joined Democrats in supporting that version as well. 
While Miyares did not express support or dissent in 2020, his office has signed the consent decree effectively lifting the ban on conversion therapy. 
As attorney general, Miyares has pressed for banning transgender youth from participating in sports teams of their identity as a suite of anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in the state during Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.  
Localities have pushed back on former Gov. Ralph Northam’s order that transgender students be able to use the bathrooms of their identities. And an in-progress constitutional amendment to remove a defunct same-sex marriage ban from the state’s constitution has advanced with slim bipartisan support. 
Advocates for that law say it’s important, as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed interest in revisiting a decade-old ruling that protects gay marriage federally. He expressed the opinion after the court struck down federal abortion protections. Should marriage protections fall, Virginia is among states that would immediately ban the unions. 
Roem reiterated the risks of conversion therapy, saying medical care for transgender people like hormone therapies or surgeries are constantly subject to medical review to assess quality of care, while talk-based conversion therapy isn’t. 
Roem, the state’s first transgender senator, said she has been on the receiving end of efforts to dissuade her from her sexual identity but it never stopped her from embracing being transgender. 
“I spent 13 years in Catholic school — I heard everything,” she said. “I am just as trans today at age 40 as I was when I got into Catholic school in 4th grade.”
Ultimately, what the conversion therapy ban came down to for Democrats, she and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax said, is public health. Given how various medical associations have denounced conversion therapy, they felt it had no place in state-licensed counselor’s services. 
“I have no problem if somebody wants to go look at religious counseling from their priest or their minister, their rabbi, their mom — that’s perfectly fine,” Surovell said. “When somebody goes to get therapy from somebody licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia, there’s a different set of rules applied. You can’t just say whatever you want because you have a license. That’s why we have professional standards, that’s why we have statutes.”
While several studies have shown negative mental and physical health impacts of conversion therapy on LGBTQ+ people, the Raymonds said a 2024 report in the United Kingdom  called for more research on gender identity services for minors. However, the report’s author noted their belief that “no LGBTQ+ group should be subjected to conversion practice.”
Challengers could appeal the decree to further deliberate the matter in courts and state lawmakers could further tweak their 2020 law when they convene next year.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/VirginiaMercury)After 20 years in the Marine Corps, including time as a helicopter pilot and a year preparing congressional testimony on Capitol Hill, I’ve seen firsthand how closely energy security and national security are connected. Here in Hampton Roads, that link is especially clear: Our economy, our neighborhoods and our military bases all depend on reliable, affordable energy to stay strong.
Today, in my work with clean energy policy and large-scale infrastructure projects, I continue to focus on solutions that strengthen both our communities and our energy security. Clean energy tax credits are one of the most effective tools we have to make that happen. They help lower energy costs for families and businesses, modernize our aging electric grid, and ensure Virginia remains a leader in the next generation of energy innovation.
The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is a great example. Located about 27 miles off Virginia Beach, the project is on track to generate enough power for 660,000 homes when it becomes fully operational next year. It will provide clean, reliable electricity to a significant portion of our region, without the price volatility and supply chain risks that come with fossil fuels.
During construction, it supports nearly 900 jobs each year, most of them based here in Hampton Roads. Once completed, it will support over 1,100 jobs annually. These are good-paying jobs that support local families and small businesses. This project is not only growing our local economy, it is also helping to strengthen the regional grid that powers critical infrastructure like Naval Air Station Oceana and other defense facilities.
Large scale projects are only part of the picture. Clean energy tax credits also make it easier for homeowners and small business owners to install rooftop solar, add battery storage, and make energy-efficiency upgrades that lower their costs and improve reliability. These improvements help people feel more in control during extreme weather or power outages, by giving them access to backup power or reducing strain on the system during peak demand.
Hampton Roads is leading by example, but continued progress depends on smart policies and strong support from elected officials who understand what is at stake.
I was encouraged to see Congresswoman Jen Kiggans continuing to take a stand against the reconciliation bill that passed the House of Representatives last month. In a bipartisan letter sent to Senate Republican leadership, Kiggans and eleven other House members emphasized common-sense reforms for energy growth to keep our economy growing and our military strong, and highlighted the importance of protecting the tax credits and supply chains that keep projects like Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind moving forward. Although she signed the House bill that would repeal or render many of these incentives useless, the letter she signed outlines a better path. If the final Senate version fails to incorporate these reforms, I hope Kiggans will do the right thing and vote against it once the bill is back on the House floor for final consideration.
Virginia is already home to more than 118,000 advanced energy jobs, and the sector continues to grow year over year. These careers range from engineering and manufacturing to installation and maintenance, offering opportunities across a wide range of skills. But that progress is not guaranteed. If key federal tax credits are rolled back or allowed to expire, energy costs for families and businesses in Virginia could rise by more than 7% by next year. That would be a step backward at a time when we should be focused on building greater energy independence, grid reliability and economic resilience.
We have made great strides, but there is more work to do. By continuing to invest in clean energy and protecting the tax credits that support it, we can build an energy future that is reliable, affordable, and secure. Hampton Roads is showing the country what is possible when we prioritize innovation and smart investment. I am proud to be part of that progress.

But neither of them has jumped into the race. And their decisions are likely the only things holding up a flood of candidates from launching campaigns of their own.
Former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, continues to “strongly consider” a campaign, his longtime political advisor told Axios on Monday. And Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and a Wilmington native, has Republicans’ “right of first refusal.”

The two potential candidates would be formidable — Cooper a longtime staple of state Democratic politics who has never lost an election, and Trump carrying the network, fundraising and name recognition of the most powerful politician in the country. But if either (or both) decide not to run, a crowded field of contenders looking to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis is all but certain.
“They are both field-clearing candidates,” Western Carolina University professor Chris Cooper said of Trump in a radio interview with NC Newsline on Tuesday. “If either one of them gets in, I don’t think we’re going to see a lot of other action.”
Trump says Lara would be ‘first choice, but she doesn’t live there now’
Speaking to the press pool on Air Force One on Tuesday, the president mentioned his daughter-in-law when asked about the race.
“Somebody that would really be great is Lara,” Trump said.
“That would always be my first choice, but she doesn’t live there now,” the president later added, saying he didn’t know “who the candidates were going to be.”
“I think you’re going to have one of the congressmen step up. But she’d do very well.”
Trump said he hadn’t yet spoken to her about the race.



Richard Hudson withdraws his name, as Republicans call for a unified campaign
North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall, the 37-year-old who ascended to the dais this year, said Tuesday that Republicans in the state “must unify behind whoever President Trump picks.”
“The NC Senate race is too important to be derailed by a messy, divisive primary,” Hall wrote on social media. “The real fight is against the radical left destroying our country.”
  U.S. Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-North Carolina)
Freshman U.S. Rep. Pat Harrigan, who has been named by several reports out of Washington as a potential candidate, named Lara Trump specifically.
“If [Lara Trump] enters this race, I’ll be the first to endorse her and the first to fight for her victory,” Harrigan wrote.
And another member of the state’s House delegation, U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, removed himself from the running Tuesday.
“My focus remains on representing the people of the 9th district — including the incredible men and women at [Fort] Bragg and their families — and on growing the House majority as NRCC chairman,” Hudson wrote.
On the Democratic side of the aisle, Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt could enter the race, a spokesperson told National Journal on Tuesday. But first, she’s waiting to see if the former governor jumps in.
“Hunt believes former Governor Roy Cooper will be the likely Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 2026 and would be a strong candidate,” the spokesperson told the D.C. publication. “If he decides not to run, she’s not ruling anything out.”
Meanwhile, the only announced high-profile Democratic candidate, former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, announced Monday that he’s in the race to stay and professed confidence that he can “take on whichever MAGA extremist Trump hand-picks to run.”

(Stock photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)Do you remember the shocking images from the Exxon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon oil spills? The oil-slicked birds, the wrecked beaches, the empty fishing boats, and worst of all, the stories of lost lives? The Trump administration wants to bring polluting and dangerous oil and gas offshore drilling back — including to our New England shores. Here at the Conservation Law Foundation, we’re joining a lawsuit to stop this reckless plan.
In the chaos of the first months of the new regime, you’d be forgiven for overlooking this news story, but we can’t let it go unnoticed. In one of the most outrageous moves coming out of the Trump administration, the president has issued a series of executive orders pushing to open our iconic coastal waters to oil and gas drilling.
They want to exploit the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, which make up much of the ocean surrounding the U.S. They want to loosen rules designed to protect the marine environment and the coasts. They even want to review national marine sanctuaries and monuments, the national parks of the sea, to see if we can plant some oil derricks on them as well. That means oil rigs in our lobster grounds. Pipelines cutting through fragile marine sanctuaries. The constant threat of spills on our coasts.
If you’re wondering, “Hey, didn’t Biden ban drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf?” Yes, he did, and no, President Donald Trump’s attempt to reverse the ban isn’t legal. That’s what the lawsuit is about.
Trump claims the U.S. is in an “energy emergency.” Spoiler alert: We’re not. In fact, we’re producing more fossil fuels than ever before. This isn’t about energy security. It’s about handing over our ocean to polluters. This flimsy justification won’t hold up in court, which is why we’ve joined Earthjustice and many other environmental organizations to challenge it.
In the last year alone, climate change has fueled a hurricane that swamped North Carolina, wildfires that leveled whole neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and floods that wiped out Vermont communities. As the environmental, financial, and human costs soar before our eyes, we need to be ramping down our fossil fuel production, not ripping up the seafloor in search of more.










In one of the most outrageous moves coming out of the Trump administration, the president has issued a series of executive orders pushing to open our iconic coastal waters to oil and gas drilling.


Fossil fuels pose an enormous danger to our climate, but they also pose a more immediate danger to everyone who has to interact with them. One study found that between 1968 and 2011, fossil fuel accidents claimed the lives of almost 5,000 Americans.
Let’s not forget that offshore drilling is a messy, high-risk business. The previously mentioned Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon catastrophes have dominated the news, but in 2003 an oil barge hit rocks off our own Cape Cod coast and dumped 98,000 gallons of oil into the waters of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The oil fouled beaches and marshes and, according to NOAA, killed countless birds while destroying oyster, clam, and fish habitat.
Our ocean is too precious to New England’s way of life to risk with dangerous, unnecessary oil drilling. Offshore drilling destroys seafloor habitats, pollutes our waters, and risks destructive oil spills. A New England ocean littered with oil rigs could mean an end to summer holidays on the beach, our iconic lobster industry, thriving fish populations, and more.
That’s why the Conservation Law Foundation is stepping up to stop the Trump administration’s reckless plan to bring offshore drilling to our shores. We’ve fought attempts to drill in our waters for decades, and we’re not stopping now.
The Trump administration’s offshore drilling plan is an insult to every New Englander who values our ocean, our way of life, and our future. We will not let anyone turn our coast into another oil-soaked headline.

President Trump’s massive budget bill moved one step closer to passage yesterday when the U.S. Senate approved it 51-50 over the objection of North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis.
If it becomes law, the bill will have devastating impacts in our state. Among other things, more than half-a-million people will likely lose their Medicaid health insurance.
Amazingly, however, some state politicians remain oblivious – or at least unmoved — by the disastrous storm that’s about to befall our state.
Take Republican state Senate leader Phil Berger. He authored a Facebook post that read quote: “I support President Donald J. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill and the legislature will work through any implementation issues.”
Uh…earth to Senator Berger: describing the loss of health insurance by hundreds of thousands of people as “implementation issues” is like calling a leg amputation a minor scratch.
The bottom line: The senator and other bill supporters will soon find they are like the proverbial dog that’s caught the bus they were chasing. And all North Carolinians will suffer as a result.

Goodlander was elected in 2024, defeating Williams with 52% of the vote, and has been in office about five months. She announced her reelection campaign in April when she decided against seeking the U.S. Senate seat of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who had said she was retiring at the end of her term. Williams launched a new campaign to challenge Goodlander almost immediately after the 2024 cycle ended. Williams also ran in 2022.
When the Bulletin reached Goodlander by phone Friday, she was in the car on her way to Claremont to meet a Vietnam veteran who was disabled as a result of his service. Goodlander said the veteran was having issues getting his Department of Veterans Affairs benefits to pay for equipment to get his wheelchair into his van because of “a really outdated, silly law that was easily fixable, but that Congress hadn’t taken the time to address.” She now hopes to work with Republicans to get a legislative fix. The ASSIST Act, which she co-sponsored, passed the House in May.
“(That) really reinforces my basic belief that the North Star is the people who I work for,” Goodlander said. “And that’s what I’m working to do every opportunity I have.”
Goodlander said all she’s learned traveling through New Hampshire are her greatest takeaways since her term began. However, she shied away from questions about what her reelection pitch will look like.
“Today is day 175 for me on this job,” she said. “And my laser focus has been on delivering in every way I possibly can for the people who I work for, the people who have entrusted me with this responsibility at this critical moment in our country’s history. So that’s my sole focus.”
Williams, on the other hand, told the Bulletin she is intentionally beginning her campaign early to avoid what she thinks tanked her previous bid. She said last cycle she wasn’t able to raise enough money or gain strong name recognition. Now, she hopes to start fundraising early, leverage the expansive online presence she’s built — Williams has more than 250,000 followers on X — and attempt to garner donations from out of state.
In New Hampshire’s open 1st Congressional District race, a trio of Seacoast Democrats lead the way

“I was pure grassroots, relying on myself and donors across the country,” she said. “Average donor was $35 last year. And after (the) primary, I basically had no money left for any kind of TV ads. We did Facebook ads, and we did mailers, and all the money was gone. And money, no matter whether you like it or not, is almost like the bread and butter of politics.”
An immigrant’s story
Williams also said if they’re both the nominees again, she’ll challenge Goodlander to more debates. She wants to build off a debate performance that went viral last year. The clip circulated all around the world, she said, and was even translated into Mandarin and viewed by her family in China.
“I’m a legal immigrant,” she said in the debate clip. “I came here the right way. It took me 6½ years to become a citizen. My brother waited in China for 13 years to come here. It is a slap in the face to all the legal immigrants who are still waiting in line all over the world.”
Williams emigrated to the U.S. in 1988. She describes herself as “a survivor of Mao’s (Zedong) Communist regime in China.” She said she hasn’t seen her family in years because she was blacklisted for speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party. Formerly a Colorado resident, Williams moved to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project — a movement that seeks to recruit libertarian-minded people to move to and run for public office in New Hampshire — though she says she is no longer very involved with the group. Throughout her campaign messages, she references her experience growing up poor in China, where she said she was “brainwashed” by the Chinese government.
She wants the U.S. to crack down on illegal immigration, but she said she supports reform to the legal immigration system.
An emphasis of New Hampshire roots
Before seeking elected office, Goodlander worked in several non-elected government roles. She served in President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice. She was a foreign policy adviser to the late U.S. Sens. John McCain, a Republican, and Joe Lieberman, a Democrat. And, as an attorney, she served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during President Donald Trump’s first impeachment hearings.
While she was born in Nashua, Goodlander’s work took her away from New Hampshire. She was sharply criticized for moving back to the district immediately before running for election and for characterizing herself as a renter in the district when she also owns another home in Portsmouth. In her 2024 campaign launch video, she emphasized her roots in New Hampshire. The video shows Goodlander talking to her mom, Betty Tamposi, about the day Goodlander was born — which happened to be an Election Day — and the pair visiting the polling place where Tamposi had voted. In the video, the two also discuss how Tamposi ran for the very same district in 1988, but was unsuccessful after facing sexist attacks from her opponent.
Goodlander told the Bulletin that as a congresswoman, she’s focusing on the cost of child care and elder care and on health-related issues, and is reaching out to work with Republicans. That includes on legislation to include small businesses in federal trade negotiations (the Small Business Advocacy and Improvements Act has passed the House) and an effort to get New Hampshire a full-service VA hospital. She also pointed to her role in the House of Representatives’ Democratic Litigation and Response Task Force, meant to oppose what it views as illegal actions by the Trump administration. She said her experience on the first Trump impeachment trial prepared her to oppose the president.
“I’m working with every tool I’ve got,” she said. “We’re in the midst of one of the most complicated litigation landscapes in the country’s history because of the Trump administration’s assault on the basic functioning of governance.”
Goodlander also has been visiting business throughout the state to talk about the negative effect of tariffs and to hospitals to talk about potential Medicaid cuts.
A change of focus
Williams said she’s also making a point to visit communities in her district she spent less time in in 2024. She said it’s part of her effort to build name recognition.
“Now we have the data to show where I lost by how much,” she said. “And I’m recruiting grassroots volunteers to help me to say, ‘Hey, maybe we can have a town hall here or there or there.’ And that’s No. 1 focus: community outreach.”
Williams sparked controversy during the last cycle when she argued during an October debate there were issues with the 2020 election and wouldn’t say whether she thought the presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump, was free and fair. She also drew criticism for repeatedly sharing memes online alleging Jews “gave up their firearms to Hitler,” which led to the Holocaust. However, speaking to the Bulletin, she focused on basics, like inflation and immigration, saying “we’re a small state, and lots of people actually are suffering. The inflation, the cost of living is very high.”
“I came here 37 years ago with nothing, and I have lived the American dream and have the financial freedom today to run for Congress and spend lots of time to connect with voters,” Williams said. “It’s because this country is great, and New Hampshire is the only place that allowed me even to be the nominee of a major political party to do it. … I’m very honored for the more than 47% of voters in District 2 who voted for me last year.”
The role of money in the race
Other candidates appear to be mulling a bid for the seat as well. Dean Pennington, a Hudson analytics professional, has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to create a campaign committee as a Democrat, but has not yet made a formal public announcement. Bill Hamlen, who ran for the Republican nomination but lost to Williams in 2024, told NHJournal in March he would run for the seat again if Goodlander didn’t.
Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said a big factor in the Republican primary will likely be whether enough people see Goodlander as vulnerable enough to challenge her.
“Are there enough encouraging signs for someone else to get in on the Republican side who might have better fundraising strengths, for example, than Williams has been able to show?” Scala said. “Williams has done an awful lot with not much in the way of resources. Is there someone out there, a challenger to Goodlander, who would be able to bring more to the table in that regard?”
Scala said each time Williams has run, she’s gained more name recognition, “just by virtue of sticking around.” Fundraising may remain an issue for her though. He thinks she’ll need to look to small donors outside the district.
“With her particular brand of conservative politics, I think that is where the money would be in terms of digital fundraising,” he said. “Can she build something that approaches a national profile? I mean, that’s a tall order.”
“One thing we’ve learned about Goodlander is she commands a lot of resources within the Democratic Party, and of course, the Democrats will be looking to take back the House,” Scala added. “So if there’s even a whiff of a threat to Goodlander, the money will be there nationally to protect that seat. Whereas, on the Republican side, you’re looking at the national chess board, you’ve got a very, very narrow majority. There will be lots of seats Republicans will be looking to defend, and they’ll get first priority. Then, there will be seats that they might be hoping to flip. Would the 2nd District even make that for the Republicans?”
In 2024, Goodlander defeated former Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern in a competitive primary. Scala said he’d “be surprised if Goodlander faces that amount of opposition to be renominated.” Still, he mused about the state of the Democratic Party.
“Is there a challenger out there who would be able to capitalize on the discontent that the Democratic base seems to feel about its leadership and would they be able to use that discontent to wage a viable primary campaign against Goodlander?” Scala said. “One advantage for Goodlander is she’s been able to kind of tote up a voting record during the first two years of the Trump presidency. So there have been a lot of votes where she could say, ‘look, I’m confronting Trump in this way and that way.’”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-02 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A CT child tax credit in 2026? Advocates vow to resume battle,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/02/ct-child-tax-credit-2026-debate/,Advocates say new reports will help make their case for a CT child tax credit by emphasizing hefty tax burdens and a high cost of living.,"Supporters of a new income tax credit for middle-class households with children couldn’t overcome Gov. Ned Lamont’s objections this spring, despite strong grassroots support and broad backing in the General Assembly.
But advocates hope new analyses later this year on tax inequities and Connecticut’s surging cost of living will provide the ammunition they need to overcome any opposition in 2026.
“We are absolutely committed to continuing to make the case for a child tax credit,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut, which collected nearly 1,300 supporting signatures via an online petition over the winter and spring. “It’s clear that families in our state need more support to make life more affordable.”
The most popular proposal circulating at the Capitol in recent years involves a $600-per-child credit, up to $1,800 per household, for low- and middle-income families. This relief also would have been refundable, meaning that even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to apply the credit to, it would still have $600 per child added to its refund.
But that plan came with a $300 million to $350 million annual price tag, and some state officials were wary Connecticut couldn’t spare the revenue — despite an annual average surplus of $1.8 billion between 2017 and 2024, and a nearly $2.2 billion projected cushion in the fiscal year that closed Monday.
Connecticut officials fear state and municipal governments combined could lose hundreds of millions of dollars — and possibly more than $1 billion — in federal aid for health care, education and other core services as Congress works this summer to slash spending and finance an extension of 2017 tax cuts.
But Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, a member of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee and one of the leading advocates for a child tax credit, said the pain from federal cutbacks “will just make the [economic] slide even harder for so many of our struggling families.”
Farrar and others on the finance committee hoped to find middle ground this past spring by endorsing a more modest, $150-per-child credit, with the understanding it could be expanded later once the full extent of federal aid reductions was known.
But Lamont was reluctant to back the credit, even with the annual cost down to about $80 million.
The governor had proposed boosting, from $300 to $350, another income tax credit that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills for middle-class households. This proposal came with roughly the same $80 million per year price tag.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, also has said on several occasions that income and wealth redistribution should be done predominantly through the federal tax system rather than at the state level.
When the smoke cleared, both plans had been scrapped and the governor and legislators agreed to spend an extra $35 million to assist only Connecticut’s working poor. 
The state earned income tax credit, which adds an average of $1,061 to the returns of about 195,000 filers — most earning less than $65,000 per year — would grow by about $250 for those with dependents. But it would be a flat, $250 increase, regardless of the number of children in a household.
Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, a liberal considering a run for governor and founder of the House Tax Equity Caucus, said “the No. 1 antagonist in the fight for a child tax credit was the governor,” adding that $600 per child “would be really meaningful” for thousands of households in Connecticut. 
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said “No governor has done more to help our working families with children than Governor Lamont.”
State income tax rate cuts in 2023 were the largest since that levy was created in 1991, he said, adding the governor also supports one of the largest tax credits for working poor families and won passage of a new initiative this year to dramatically increase affordable child care.
“We continue to look for ways to reduce taxes; any additional tax cuts must be sustainable in future years,” Collibee said.
Reports show CT’s middle class is slipping
But advocates for a broad-based child tax credit say that while this year’s tax-cutting compromise will help the working poor, they need much more assistance, as do middle-class families.
“Our elected officials need to meet the urgency of this moment and must prioritize the passage of policies boldly aimed at improving statewide equity, quality of life and access to resources,” said Janée Woods Weber, executive director of She Leads Justice, a nonprofit formerly known as the Connecticut Women’s Education and Legal Fund.
The United Way has tried to make that case every two years through its ALICE methodology for assessing Connecticut’s high cost of living. ALICE is an acronym for Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained and Employed.
A Connecticut family of four needed $108,324 in 2022 not to be economically secure, but simply to survive, the United Way reported last fall. And that’s assuming the household took full advantage of all tax credits available to it, something the United Way says is often missed.
The ALICE calculations represent an alternative to the Federal Poverty Level, a simple metric developed in the mid-1960s by U.S. Social Security Administration economists and based largely on the cost of a minimum food diet. A family of four earning more than $27,750 was considered above the poverty line in 2022 based on that benchmark.
The ALICE survival budget reflects housing, food, utilities, transportation, child care and — assuming the family can’t afford a computer — the cost of one smartphone.
The Urban Institute, a nonprofit economic and social policy research group, echoed the United Way’s projections in a report last November.
The institute found a family of four in the northeastern U.S. needed to earn close to $151,100 in 2022 to be economically secure.
Bates said last week that the United Way will update its ALICE calculations this fall and continue the reports annually to underscore the high cost of raising a family in Connecticut.
Advocates also hope mandates to beef up the state’s own tax fairness study will create enough momentum to establish a child tax credit next year.
The Department of Revenue Services’ 2024 report found the lowest-earning 10% of households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and more than twice the statewide average.
And since Connecticut began issuing tax fairness studies a decade ago, the imbalance only has worsened.
Even one of the largest state tax cuts in 2023, which included the first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, only slowed — but didn’t reverse — the ever-widening shift onto working families, according to a 2024 analysis from Connecticut Voices for Children, a progressive New Haven-based policy group.
The next tax fairness report, due this December, must consider a broader range of state and municipal levies than prior analyses did, according to changes ordered by legislators.
This report is “one of the few tools residents have to better understand how unfair our tax system is and whether progress is being made to make it fairer,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the finance committee and another backer of the child tax credit, said she suspects some opposition was based in the fear Connecticut couldn’t afford to offer this relief without raising income taxes on the state’s richest households.
The finance panel did recommend a 1.75% surcharge on capital gains earnings on individuals making over $1 million and couples over $2 million — which was a non-starter for Lamont, who says taxing the rich would prompt them to flee Connecticut.
But Horn said that was proposed to safeguard state programs against federal funding cuts and was never seen as a necessity to make income tax relief for poor and middle-class families affordable.
Support for a child tax credit, she added, stems from “a broad-based recognition of the cost of raising kids in Connecticut … at a time we want to encourage young families to live here and stay here.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CT-state-capitol-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-07-02 05:02:19.097519

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)While attending the 2025 National Association of Social Work’s Annual Conference in June, I received an email from U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, praising President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” as a transformative legislative package that will prevent economic disaster and uplift American families.
If you have never been in the presence of 2,400-plus social workers, all focused on “Celebrating Our Legacy, Developing the Future,” allow me to paint a mental picture. The environment is nonstop movement acceleration, filled with speakers, activities, and events to rekindle our purpose and then equip and mobilize us for anti-oppressive work that includes addressing policy concerns.
The “big, beautiful bill,” propped up by a mountain of misrepresentations, is a major policy concern for us all.
Most of the presenters at the conference reminded us of our responsibility to challenge injustices, responding to rhetoric that is often mentally paralyzing. These weapons of immobilization must not succeed. Kansans and Americans across the country are struggling with real-life concerns such as affordable child care, access to food and health care, and fair wages. We owe it to ourselves to examine political promises with a discerning eye, especially when the promises directly affect those we serve.
Much of what “Doc” Marshall touted in his email is not only exaggerated, but contradicted by history, data, and his own voting record.
 
The ‘largest tax increase’
Marshall claims that if the Trump-era tax cuts expire, we will face “the largest tax increase in American history.” This is false and fearmongering. I have addressed fearmongering in a previous op-ed.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, disproportionately beneficial to the wealthy, is set to expire this year unless renewed by Congress. According to the Tax Policy Center, the majority of the cuts benefit the top 20% of earners. Middle-income families benefitted less than $1,500 per year, not the $12,000 per year that Marshall claims.
To be clear, if these tax cuts expire it would restore pre-2017 rates, not introduce new taxes. The plan’s tax benefits go to corporations and wealthy individuals, not working families.
 
A thousand dollars a month?
Marshall asserts that making the administration’s tax cuts permanent would save American families “$1,000 per month.” Data tell a different story.
The Congressional Budget Office and Brookings Institution have both found that households in the bottom 60% of earners received less than $100 per month from the original tax cut package. The only people saving anywhere near $1,000 per month were those making more than $500,000 annually.
Claiming that “families” would save this much is a distortion designed to garner support from people who will never see those savings.
 
Sleight of hand
The Child Tax Credit is an area where bipartisanship could make a meaningful difference. But the good doctor’s concern rings hollow.
In 2021, the American Rescue Plan temporarily increased the CTC to $3,600 per child. According to Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy, this potentially cut child poverty nearly in half in just six months. Marshall and his colleagues opposed this expansion and refused to make it permanent.
Now, Marshall wants to take credit for increasing the credit to $2,200 — just two-thirds of what he once rejected — and portrays inaction as a threat to our children. If concern for families were truly bipartisan, why is the higher credit not already permanent?
 
‘Trump Savings’
Marshall’s mention of “Trump Savings” for newborns, meant to provide a financial head start, is not supported by any legislative framework or credible funding method. While the idea of universal savings accounts should be explored, without transparency about cost, implementation or bipartisan support, it remains campaign rhetoric — not policy.
 
Paid family leave
The senator also claims the Trump bill will extend paid family and medical leave tax credits. Ironically, the expansion of paid leave was included in the American Rescue Plan Act, which he voted against.
When Democrats introduced legislation to provide comprehensive national paid leave in 2021 and 2022, Marshall and most of his colleagues dismissed it as “wasteful spending.” Now, he is attempting to adopt the language of worker protections without a record to back it up.
 
Childcare and SNAP
On child care, Marshall claims that the bill will increase access for single mothers and low-income families. But just last year, Republicans proposed cuts to the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the primary federal program supporting child care access.
And on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the senator blames “blue states” for abusing benefits. The fact is, states are granted flexibility to adapt programs to regional cost of living and workforce conditions, and there’s no credible evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation. What Marshall calls “abuse,” others call feeding children in high-cost cities. Imposing stricter work requirements will harm the very people SNAP is designed to help — the elderly, disabled and underemployed Americans, not freeloaders.
As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, if Marshall wants to propose legislation to help families, he should start with facts, and hold to the promises made at his Yates Center “town hall.” No falsehoods, distortions, or selective memory can withstand the lived experiences of constituents.
After having been passed by the Senate early Tuesday, the legislative package now heads back to the U.S. House for reconsideration. Lawmakers still have can decide whether to change, approve or reject the legislation.
Kansans deserve leadership grounded in truth, not political spectacle. We must demand that our elected officials tell the truth about who benefits from their policies, and more importantly, who gets left behind. Because when policy becomes performance, it’s the people who pay the price.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)In the aftermath of the ruling by Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Jaiza Page that the Ohio universal school voucher program is unconstitutional, some public school advocates have an idea for Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman and his Republican colleagues: Enroll in a “Science of Reading” class. 
It is beyond ironic that lawmakers like Huffman mandated a prescriptive reading program like “Science of Reading” and required teachers to complete professional development in the program by June 30, 2025, yet ignored the clear and unambiguous written language in the Ohio Constitution that formed the basis for the anti-voucher lawsuit that was just decided in the Franklin County court.
Science of Reading proponents in the legislature and elsewhere, please process this passage at the literal level of reading comprehension:

Ohio Constitution, Article VI, Section 2
The General Assembly shall make such provisions, by taxation, or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state; but no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state.

In the reading process (no science here), we should extract the main idea of the passage to mean that taxes raised by the legislature are for the purpose of maintaining a system of common (public) schools and not religious schools.
 At the literal level of comprehension in the reading process, the term system, according to the Google machine, means an “interconnecting framework” and the very example given for this definition is “the public school system.”
What seems bizarre about the actions of the Ohio legislature in creating the universal voucher program is that the very folks who were so obsessed with mandating a specific instructional approach to the teaching of reading did not comprehend that there is no inferential level to be deployed in the straightforward text of the state’s constitution. 
Former lawmaker Stephen Dyer succinctly framed Judge Page’s reasoning in making her decision for the plaintiffs:

It creates a separate, uncommon school system
It prevents the state from fully funding its own public school system
It gives control over taxpayer money to religious schools, which is expressly forbidden in the Ohio Constitution.

Astute readers will note that the judge’s reasoning as sketched in the three points above is centered in the clear l851 prose found in Article VI. 
By doing so, the merits of the case can be separated by the plethora of extraneous distractors crafted by voucher proponents that include such terms as “scholarships,” “school choice,” “a matter of social justice,” and “money should follow the student.” 
Textualists and Original Intent scholars please note: None of those words or terms are found in the Ohio Constitution. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In making its findings, the court found that the private school voucher program, in violation of the constitution, “created a system of uncommon private schools,” provides “a religion or other sect … control of, a part of the school funds of Ohio, and that providing private and religious schools an “unknown amounts of public revenue…is not thorough and efficient.”
As a way to add perspective to her findings, Judge Page in her opinion did sketch some earlier attempts to amend Article VI, Section 2. A delegate at the 1873 Constitutional Convention made a motion to delete the phrase “but no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state.” 
However, another delegate at the convention took exception, and Judge Page noted in her narrative that his words composed more than 150 years ago in opposition to the proposed amendment were added into the official record:

(T)he object of the amendment becomes apparent; it is to leave the Constitution so crippled that the various religious denominations may divide the common school fund among them, for the support of sectarian schools.

Inasmuch as the vast majority of state private school voucher funds have been snapped up to further undermine the fiscal needs of the state’s public schools, the 1873 attempt to delete a key portion of the state constitution’s prohibition against funding religious schools should be instructive when this case, as expected, moves to the appellate stage.
The lawsuit was led by William Phillis, the executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity and Adequacy of School Funding, with support from nearly half of the school districts in the state. 
In a statement after the Coalition’s victory in the Franklin County court, Phillis posted this brief statement:
“The Constitution of Ohio is very clear. The General Assembly is responsible for a thorough and efficient system of common schools. It is illegal for the state to tax Ohioans for private school ventures.”
In the meantime, June 30 is the expiration date for teachers to complete their professional development training in the Science of Reading. 
Speaker Huffman, Ohio Senate Education Committee Chair Andrew Brenner and other school voucher proponents can always enroll in the Science of Reading professional development training that they mandated for teachers to attend. 
As a result, Huffman, Brenner, et. al. may then be better equipped in the future to approach textual language in their work and thus know that when it comes to reading comprehension, there is a difference between a literal and inferential response to text. 
They may also learn that there is no science required in reading clear prose that was crafted in 1851, and understanding the main idea in the text. 
Huffman said in 2023 about Ohio Republican lawmakers that “we can kind of do what we want.” 
Those who support education as a public good challenge his assertion and will continue to oppose the unconstitutional school voucher program. 
A Franklin County judge has determined that when it comes to reading and comprehending the constitution, these same lawmakers must recognize that respect for the law must start with themselves. 
In the meantime, Ohio lawmakers should consider Science of Reading training. It might help the state avoid future lawsuits and deter them from kind of doing what they want.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.










We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics


Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

The 2026 general election is still more than a year away, but plenty of hats are being thrown into the proverbial ring to run for U.S. senator, Georgia governor and other top positions.
But there are other, smaller proverbial rings into which more modest hats are also already being tossed.
All 180 seats in the state House and all 56 in the state Senate will be up for grabs on ballots around the state, and the results will shape what laws Peach Staters live under in 2027 and beyond, as well as the partisan makeup under the Gold Dome. Currently, the House includes 100 Republicans and 80 Democrats and the Senate has 33 Republicans and 23 Democrats.
Official qualifying doesn’t begin until the spring, but here’s a look at some of the candidates who have already announced their intentions to run or filed paperwork with the Georgia Ethics Commission’s campaign finance system.
Replacements for senators seeking higher office

Expect to see plenty of new faces in the Senate in particular, as ambitious senators shoot their shots at positions of greater power. That includes President Pro Tem John F. Kennedy of Macon, who is stepping down in the hopes of upgrading his title to lieutenant governor.
Two Republicans have filed paperwork so far to run for Kennedy’s seat. Former state Rep. Lauren Daniel, who was defeated in her 2024 GOP primary by now-state Rep. Noelle Kahaian of Locust Grove, is set to face off against attorney Steven McNeel.
In a post on social media, Daniel styled herself as a committed backer of conservative causes.
“In a culture where traditional values are under attack from the radical left and many politicians are afraid to fight, I am willing to do just that,” she said. “As a staunch conservative, mother of four and unabashed supporter of the America First policies championed by President Trump, I believe I can represent middle Georgia in an effective way without compromising our values.”
McNeel was not immediately available for comment, but according to his bio on the website for the law firm where he works, he has a degree in political science from the University of Georgia, is a member of the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association and specializes in bodily injury, wrongful death, workers’ compensation and Social Security disability law.
  Sen. Emanuel Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Two Democrats have filed paperwork to replace Decatur Democratic Sen. Emanuel Jones, who is among the Democrats challenging Congressman David Scott next year.
Larry Johnson, a former longtime DeKalb County commissioner, said on his website that he hopes to “bring his experience, leadership, and bold vision to Georgia fighting for better schools, economic justice, and stronger communities.”
But before he can do that, he’ll need to defeat Kate Denny, a nurse and mom from Avondale Estates, who garnered attention when she pressed U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff to do more to oppose President Donald Trump at an April town hall.
Denny said she plans to make a formal announcement in the coming days and hit the campaign trail early, speaking to voters about kitchen table issues.
“I care deeply about the things that we all care about in this district: housing, health care, childcare, wages, everything that will help all of us come together and elevate ourselves and our neighbors,” she said.
Other notable Senate candidates: 

Rep. Will Wade, a Dawsonville Republican, is seeking to move across the Capitol with a run to replace Dahlonega Republican Sen. Steve Gooch, who is running for lieutenant governor. Lumpkin County Commission Chair Chris Dockery and Dawson County business owner Douglas Sherill have both announced plans to run for Wade’s seat in the House.
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin has announced plans to run for lieutenant governor, and so far, two Republicans have filed paperwork to run for his seat, Michael Dvorscak, who works in commercial real estate, and financial analyst Carson McQueen. McLaurin won his seat in 2022 with 54.7% of the vote. He didn’t have a Republican opponent in 2024.
Four Republican candidates have filed paperwork to replace Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert: Michael Broun, an attorney at Cowsert’s law firm; Oconee County Republican Steven Todd Strickland; Marc McMain, a small business owner and former Walton County GOP Chair, and Doug McKillip, who previously served in the House as a Democrat and later as a Republican.
Bret Dunn, a former Marine Corps captain and judge advocate general, is the sole candidate so far seeking to replace Sen. Brian Strickland, who is running for attorney general.
Toombs County Commission Chairman David Sikes is the only one so far to file paperwork for a bid for the seat of Sen. Blake Tillery, who has filed paperwork to run for lieutenant governor but not officially launched a campaign.

Whose House?

In the House, a high-profile grudge match and a race between a 10-year incumbent and a reality TV dentist could be shaping up to be top races to watch.
Buford Republican state Rep. Sandy Donatucci won her seat by a hair in 2024 – with more than 30,000 votes cast, she won by just 80 votes – over the Democratic incumbent, former Rep. Farooq Mughal.
But Mughal is hoping to mount a comeback – he officially launched his campaign earlier this month, and Democrats are hoping distaste with the party in the White House will help his chances in the swingingest of Georgia’s swing districts.
“Economic uncertainty and Trump’s reckless tariff policies are straining Georgia businesses. Rising healthcare costs and the consequences of Georgia’s extreme abortion ban are harming our families,” Mughal said in a statement. “We need a representative who understands how to bring home resources for safer schools, stronger neighborhoods, and to protect our quality of life from overdevelopment and corporate land grabs. I believe in putting people over politics and delivering real solutions for our community.”

Donatucci, a sales professional and military spouse, has pitched herself as a common-sense Republican who will focus on improving the economy and boosting public safety.
“My promise to the people of House District 105 was to stand up for what is best for our families,” reads a statement on her website. “At the State Capitol, I am working to bring a common-sense approach to the challenges that we all face. Together, I know we can find solutions to secure a safer and more prosperous future for our families and community.”
Lithonia Democratic Rep. Doreen Carter, who was sworn into office in 2015, could be facing a challenge from Dr. Heavenly Kimes, a dentist and one of the stars of “Married to Medicine” on Bravo. The reality TV show follows the lives of Kimes and other women medical professionals in Atlanta.
Numerous incumbents from both parties are set to face challengers in their party primaries and in the November general. For now, some of them are just bracing for it, including Sandy Springs Democratic Rep. Esther Panitch, who, in a fundraising post on social media, said she expects a primary challenger to mount a campaign “rooted in far-left ideology.”
For the most part, the incumbents will be at a strong advantage, but one race House Democrats could be sweating is the one for House District 128 represented by Sandersville Democrat Mack Jackson.
Jackson survived one of 2024’s squeakiest squeakers. Jackson surpassed Republican challenger Tracy Wheeler by 48 votes out of more than 27,000 votes cast.
So far, one Republican may have eyes to squeak past Jackson in 2026. Thomas Wilkerson of Warrenton has filed paperwork to run for the House in District 128.

Studies have shown that food insecurity disproportionately affects Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and refugee families. Within these communities, certain groups, such as individuals with food allergies, face even more complex challenges. Not only may they struggle to secure enough food, but they must also ensure that the available food is safe for them to eat.

Idalis Cardona
Food allergies refer to an overreaction of the immune system to specific foods. Reactions can range from milder symptoms, such as hives, cough, nausea, to severe, life-threatening reactions called anaphylaxis. Avoidance of known food allergens is paramount to prevent allergic reactions. 
An estimated 32 million Americans live with food allergies; for them, food selection is not simply a dietary preference, but a critical matter of safety and survival. For low-income individuals or those experiencing food insecurity, managing food allergies adds another layer of difficulty. Allergen-free foods are often significantly more expensive—sometimes costing between two and four times what non-allergen-free foods cost—and place a significant burden on families who are already struggling to put food on the table.
In early 2024, the Commission on Women, Children, Seniors, Equity and Opportunity released its annual Food Security Report. The report incorporated public data, academic research, input from food organizations, individual experiences, and community feedback. It highlighted the added challenges faced by families managing food allergies due to limited availability and the high cost of allergen-free foods.
The report also reinforced the connection between food insecurity and poor overall health outcomes.  These outcomes are even more concerning for individuals with food allergies, as research has shown that individuals from low-income families have twice the risk of emergency department visits due to food allergies in comparison to their higher-income peers.
The report also identified several public and private initiatives that have helped address food insecurity, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), The Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, school meal programs, food banks and food pantries. It also offered recommendations to address further food insecurity in Connecticut, including adjusting SNAP benefits, promoting universal free school meals, and supporting locally grown produce.
However, many of these programs are now at risk due to budget cuts at both the state and federal levels. Reductions in funding to SNAP, WIC, and school meal programs threaten to reverse progress and will disproportionately affect marginalized communities, including those managing food allergies. These cuts not only reduce assistance but also limit access to safe, allergen-free food options. As resources shrink, the burden on local food banks and community organizations increases, while the most vulnerable are left with fewer safe and affordable food choices.
For individuals with food allergies, access to safe food is as critical as access to sufficient food. At an individual level, we all have a role to play in fostering a more equitable food system. We can help by raising awareness within our communities, supporting organizations focused on equitable food access, and advocating for allergy-safe options in food pantries, school meal programs, and public food initiatives. 
Just as importantly, we must be creative in how we contribute, whether we actively lead initiatives, educate others, or start conversations. Small, thoughtful actions can lead to meaningful change.

DemasThe Michigan House of Representatives missed their July 1 window to get a new budget bill funding K-12 schools, but there was a chance that the chamber could pass one of several amended versions of the Senate’s school funding plan on Tuesday evening.
Members of the House, however, failed to do so after a nine-hour session that saw no movement on one of eight options to amend the Senate’s plan for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
Both parties were left holding the football and pointing fingers at the other, with Democrats blaming House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) for not speaking to them productively in weeks, and with Republicans calling out the Senate’s early departure on Tuesday as the reason nothing got done.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Earlier on Tuesday, the Democratic-led Senate adjourned and held a press conference announcing that they had no deal with their Republican counterparts in the House majority and that the budget for schools would not be passed by the Michigan Legislature’s self-imposed July 1 deadline.
In the adjacent chamber, the House was in recess but reignited caucus activity to try and see if it could get bipartisan support for a number of amendments to Senate Bill 166, the upper chamber’s school bill that passed the Senate in May. 
Hall told reporters on Tuesday evening that his plan was to give House Democrats a chance to become “relevant” in the budget process by forging a deal on the Senate bill that included some concessions on per pupil funding and putting some of the categoricals the House wanted to cut from their own K-12 bill back into the mix.
“I’ve been working on this for months to try and make sure we had everything we needed for today, to try and get it done even if it was on 30-minutes notice,” Hall said.

The speaker had earlier in the process said that he didn’t need House Democrats to be a crucial part of the budget talks and that he would forge ahead without them if necessary. That changed when the Senate went home early on Tuesday, Hall said.
Hall described his need to include them as giving Democrats an opportunity to reengage, and if they could come to a consensus and pass a substitute to the Senate bill on Tuesday, that might bring Senate Democrats back to the table.
But the speaker said Democrats did not take the opportunity and that’s when things fell apart. At about 8 p.m. – seven and half hours into the House session – Hall said it was clear that wasn’t going to happen.
Michigan Advance asked Hall why he didn’t plow ahead with a party-line vote to at least move an amended bill back to the Senate, given his previous comment on the supposed irrelevancy of House Democrats.
Hall said that wouldn’t have been enough leverage to force the Senate back into session sooner than or on July 15, when they are next scheduled to hold a session day.
Hall said he didn’t think that provided a lot of value to what they were trying to achieve, and that putting up another party-line bill would ultimately get no support in the Senate. With House Democrats involved, that could have been a different scenario.
“I don’t see how that would have brought the Senate Democrats back on July 15 to sign a deal,” he said. “I felt like once they adjourned, we had to come and get a considerable number of House Democrats to vote yes in order to create enough leverage and pressure.”
Following adjournment, state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, issued a statement ripping the Senate for their early departure, which Republicans said throughout the evening was the reason they couldn’t continue working on a deal.
“The House was ready to dig in and get this done today, and we remain committed to approving a responsible K-12 budget as soon as possible to give our schools certainty,” Bollin said. “We’ve spent weeks negotiating in good faith with the governor’s office and the Senate, and we were hopeful about the progress being made. Unfortunately, the Senate stepped away before we could reach the finish line.”
State Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton), the House Democrat’s minority leader, essentially said that was a load of bull.
Puri blamed the Republicans for stalling all day and for not holding productive conversations with their Democratic colleagues. Puri also said that he hasn’t spoken to Hall in weeks, or at least not in any productive manner that would signal progress on the budget.

As to their relevancy in the budget process, Puri said they certainly needed House Democrats on Tuesday.
“Yet again, Matt Hall and the Republicans tried to jam through a process that should be taking months of good faith negotiations into just a couple of hours,” Puri told reporters following session. “I have not been looped into negotiations. They’re still being done in back rooms, and as we have seen today, that is a failed approach. This wasn’t a compromise. It wasn’t a negotiation. He is someone whose feelings get hurt when he doesn’t get his way.”
Puri also accused Hall of wasting his members’ time on Tuesday.
Hall, for his part, didn’t believe that the Senate would actually be back on July 15, further putting the budget for schools in limbo when they need clear plans from the Legislature on funding.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1251-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 23:59:31.989999

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After months of infighting that exposed deep fractures within the Virginia GOP, the party’s three statewide candidates appeared together for the first time Tuesday evening, projecting a message of unity at a packed rally in Vienna.
The event at the Vienna Volunteer Fire Department drew more than 500 supporters and marked a public effort to move past a bitter dispute that erupted this spring when Gov. Glenn Youngkin privately asked John Reid, the party’s nominee for lieutenant governor, to withdraw from the race. 
At the center of the turmoil was Matt Moran, a longtime GOP operative and head of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC, who was accused by Reid’s campaign of spreading false and defamatory claims about explicit images linked to a Tumblr account with the same social media handle as Reid’s. Reid denied being tied to the account in any way. 
Despite that request, Reid took the stage Tuesday alongside Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking re-election, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, now running for governor. They shared a stage on a sweltering summer evening, as volunteers handed out water bottles to attendees crowding into the fire station’s main hall.
Reid, a longtime conservative radio host and the first openly gay person nominated for statewide office in Virginia, framed the moment as a turning point.
“Call this Commitment Day,” he told the cheering audience. “I am all in for the Republican ticket of Winsome Sears for governor, Jason Miyares returning as attorney general … because the Republicans have the right policies to save the state of Virginia.”

Without referencing the recent controversy directly, Reid emphasized his credentials and long-standing work within the GOP. 
“I’m the guy, like you, who gets up early on Election Day, opens the polls, and stays until they close,” he said. “I’ve stood up for minorities, for unpopular people — and yes, even for Democrats when they’ve been wronged. I’ll do the same for you in Richmond.”
The remarks attempted to rally Republican voters behind a ticket that has been overshadowed in recent months by damaging internal conflict. 
Youngkin, who had remained largely silent during the dispute, offered a full-throated endorsement of the entire Republican slate at Tuesday’s rally — including Reid.
“It must be winning time again! Are you ready to sweep?” Youngkin shouted to the fired up Republicans in the room. “We’ve demonstrated how to win in Virginia — and we’re going to do it again this November.”
He praised each member of the ticket, calling Earle-Sears “a Marine who knows how to fight,” Miyares “the best attorney general in the country,” and Reid the right choice to break ties in a closely divided state Senate.
“There’s a lot of stuff I don’t know,” Youngkin said, “but I do know this — when there is a 50/50 tie in that Senate, John Reid is going to sign bills the right way, and say no when they’re the wrong bills.”
Miyares leaned heavily on the campaign’s law-and-order message, casting his first term as a reversal of Democratic mismanagement.
“The Virginia of 2021 was very, very different,” he said. “It was like when you watch those mafia movies and the guy wakes up in the trunk of the Buick — he doesn’t know where he’s headed, but he knows it’s not a good final destination. That was Virginia. We were dying as a state.”
Miyares credited the Youngkin administration with driving down the state’s murder rate and addiction deaths, and pledged to continue fighting crime, fentanyl trafficking and lenient parole policies.
Earle-Sears, who now tops the ticket, delivered the most fiery speech of the evening, lashing out at her Democratic opponent, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger.
“Make no mistake about it: the ideas that my opponent has are socialist in nature,” she declared. “She is reckless and she is radical. I want to grow jobs and she wants to grow government. Folks, this is not hard. This is about freedom!”
She warned that repealing Virginia’s right-to-work laws — a position Spanberger has not openly supported either — would drive businesses out of the state.
“I am not anti-union, I am pro-worker,” Earle-Sears said. “To be pro-freedom is to be pro-liberty… Businesses will get up and go. They’re going to turn us into Maryland, New York, or California.”

And in a moment that brought the crowd to its feet, Earle-Sears rejected the notion that America is inherently unjust.
“If things are so bad, then how is it that here I am — an immigrant, a Black woman — and I am second in command in the former capital of the Confederate States?” she asked.
But Democrats were quick to dismiss the GOP’s show of unity as superficial and out of step with voters’ real concerns. 
Maggie Amjad, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Earle-Sears’ rhetoric at the rally only underscored how closely she aligns with former President Donald Trump. 
“No matter what Winsome Earle-Sears says, Virginians know that she will always put Donald Trump’s agenda before the commonwealth,” Amjad said in a text message. 
She accused the lieutenant governor of cheering on policies that threaten Virginia’s economy and failing to stand up against cuts to Medicaid that could affect more than 300,000 residents. 
“While Virginians deserve a governor who fights for the commonwealth,” Amjad added, “Sears is dismissing workers worried about their jobs and telling Virginians to ‘wait and see’ as their healthcare is at risk.”
Still, Tuesday’s GOP rally served as a public reset for the party after an earlier unity event planned for Henrico County was abruptly canceled in May as tensions reached a boiling point. At the time, former Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling was among those who publicly criticized the fallout, noting that no one had confirmed whether the explicit account in question was ever actually linked to Reid.
“It derailed what was supposed to be the GOP’s first show of unity,” Bolling said at the time.
Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Mark Peake struck a more optimistic tone Tuesday, declaring the current statewide ticket “the best since 2021” and predicting victory across the board.
“We are going to win all three statewide races,” Peake said. “There are three reasons why: Winsome Earle-Sears, Jason Miyares, and John Reid.”
For their part, the GOP party leaders appear intent on turning the page and putting the rift behind them.
“Virginia today is the very best place to live and work and raise a family,” Youngkin told the crowd. “But we have to protect that. We know how to win — and now we have the candidates to do it.”

Lisa Murkowski took questions from Alaska reporters in a 25-minute phone news conference on Tuesday addressing her “Yes” vote for the controversial budget bill – dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” – which the U.S. Senate narrowly passed, 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. It now goes back to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration and a final vote, in order to become law.  
The following transcript of the news conference has been lightly edited to improve readability:
Becky Bohrer, Association Press: Senator, there was a lot of attention and eyes on you. What was it that ultimately secured your vote on this bill? 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski: Well, it was an accumulation of different initiatives that we’ve been working on for a long time. I’ve been really focused on making sure that the most vulnerable in our communities are not made more vulnerable by the provisions in this bill. There’s a lot of good things in the bill, we recognize that. I wanted to get the tax cuts; I wanted to see those continued. That’s significant. There’s some good provisions on the tax side, everything from the child tax credit to some of the things with no tax on overtime, some of those things — the Coast Guard and many of the initiatives.
But the challenge was — and we saw it on the House side, and we saw it here in the Senate — the challenge is where you pay for those. And so the instruction to look to Medicaid was hard for us in Alaska — is hard for us in Alaska (with a) high Medicaid population, and high SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) population. But a reality (is) that those numbers are increasing, and so how can we make some fair and reasonable reforms. I happen to think that work requirements are not something that we should shy from. But we needed time to make them work, and it doesn’t make sense to have penalties for not complying when you’re doing everything you can do to try to make that happen. So I spent a lot of time in these areas. And we made some, I think, good headway on these. It took a lot of time, and literally, we were in the quote “Byrd bath,” where you argue matters before the parliamentarian through the middle of the night, literally going through these provisions. We had been fighting to get a significant increase in the FMAP (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage). We fought very hard, and the provision that we had written did not comply with the Byrd test, and so we had to go back and rewrite it, not once, not twice, but I think maybe three, maybe it was four times, I don’t know. Anyway, it is important to make sure that the higher cost of living in Alaska is recognized, that the cost of health care delivery is high, and that these drive up our Medicaid costs compared to the national average.
So what we ended up with early this morning, or I don’t remember when it was, some hours ago, was a provision that is not a full FMAP fix, but it is through the Rural Health Transformation Education Program, which we just call the Rural Hospital Program, we were able to “plus up” that program by doubling it. So it is now a $50 billion fund. The state of Alaska, well, all states will receive a base minimum from that fund to help their smaller hospitals. … I’m trying to read this legislative text that is all scribbled and scrawled out, so bear with me as I try to get my numbers right. But what Alaska will receive from that program is quite considerable. That, along with the opportunity for the state to receive direct support through this grant funding program under the same section there, we estimate will yield the state close to $300 million a year for the next five years. This is going to be important to us. 
We’ve got a (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) system, an IT system that we know is flawed. In fact, it has failed our state. I think it’s very unfortunate that the state has not chosen to invest in that, I think that there were some decisions made with staffing by the governor that they really kind of knocked us behind, and we’re paying for that now with a very high error rate that’s causing penalties. So what we’re trying to do is not be punitive here, but delay the implementation of the cost share for at least two years, and hopefully beyond two years. To give the state time to get the system underway, it would be a two-year delay with an additional two years — until 2030 — if the state is showing good faith efforts along the way. And so this is a commitment that the state is making. 
So that’s going to be important, because we need to get that error rate down. I think everyone wants to do that and is committed to doing that. So those are some of the things on the Medicaid side. And then again, on SNAP, it was important to get some recognition for the high cost of — just high cost of living there in Alaska, and so changing some of the formula in terms of the work requirements so that it recognizes that you have areas of the state that are higher cost, not necessarily lower density. It’s definitely not lower density.











I think quite honestly, we’ve got more work to do. I don’t know whether the House is going to accept this, and I don’t know whether the president is going to continue to demand that it be passed before the Fourth of July. I think that’s a mistake.


– U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska



	I know I sound rummy, and it’s only because I am super rummy. Haven’t slept in a long, long, long, long, long while now. But the amendment that we were able to secure on that was one that was literally presented to the floor — I don’t know what time it is now. It’s 1 o’clock, like at 11 o’clock this morning, before we went to the final passage. So what I did was I worked my butt off to make sure that Alaskans were not going to be penalized, and we’re not going to be harmed. 
This is not a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination. I am not happy with the process. In fact, I’m really very disappointed in the process. When you’re working on major legislation like this, to be dealing with a product that you’re looking at for the first time in the middle of the night is not right. But I needed to make sure that Alaska’s interests were represented. I think I did, I think I did well by the state, in terms of trying to get these accommodations. We’ve got some flexibility working with the departments that we’ve received both from CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) and from the secretary of agriculture. But I think quite honestly, we’ve got more work to do. I don’t know whether the House is going to accept this, and I don’t know whether the president is going to continue to demand that it be passed before the Fourth of July. I think that’s a mistake. I think there is more work that can be done jointly between the House and the Senate, and I would welcome that and work that, with every effort that I can make.
Joe Plesha, communications director for Sen. Murkowski: Nobody has slept in the last 48 hours, so you have to give us a little leeway here.
Iris Samuels, Anchorage Daily News: Thank you, Senator, for taking the time to speak with us. I wanted to ask you about your support for the tax cuts that are in the bill. We heard from several groups in Alaska, including the leaders in the Alaska House and Senate, who basically criticized that these tax cuts disproportionately go to favor upper-income people across the country, and in Alaska too. I’m curious, why do you support some of the tax cuts in the bill that go towards wealthier Americans?
Sen. Murkowski: Well, what we did, we didn’t pick and choose. We basically took the 2017 tax rates and continued that. And so what we effectively are able to do is ensure that at the end of the year, when those tax cuts — which were put in place in 2017 — when they expire, people around this country at all levels do not see a huge, massive tax increase. Because that’s what would happen if we had not extended these: They all would have gone back up at all levels. So when you say, ‘Well, we’re only, we’re only thinking about the wealthy here,’Sen. (Susan) Collins (R-Maine) had an amendment to increase the highest tax rate, which is 39.5% or, excuse me, 39.6% to increase that back up to what it was prior to 2017, and direct that money to into the Rural Hospital Fund. So I recognize that the wealthiest of the wealthy — and in Sen. Collins’ amendment, she was going to get after those who earn more than $25 million a year — I think if you’re making more than $25 million a year, you’re probably not that bothered by whether you go from 39 to 41 (percent). 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAnd so one of the things that we did try to do, also recognizing more on the lower end of the economic scale, was to advance no tax on tips. You know, when you’re working in a restaurant, you’re not making big money usually. No tax on overtime, you know, if you’re a seasonal employee, you may be making good money during the fishing season, but beyond that, to be able to have that savings is important. There is a provision for those on Social Security to be able to receive a higher deduction. The child tax credit — which, again, I think is important to families — we increased that.
So, you know, when you look just at the tax rates that are out there, that’s one thing. But it was a much, much broader package. I think much of what was advanced for our small businesses, again, is going to be welcome news in Alaska, for our small business owners and their families. So I think it was important to continue the tax cuts from 2017 to avoid really a significant tax hike to everybody.
James Brooks, Alaska Beacon: Senator, it sounded like you were able to also negotiate some changes with regard to both clean energy and North Slope drilling. What were you able to negotiate in the final bill?
Sen. Murkowski: Yeah, thank you, James. Usually I would have led off with some of the energy provisions, because, you know how I like to focus on that. But we were able to deal with some of the, I think, really harsh treatment that we had seen introduced when it came to the energy tax credits that had initially been passed through the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act). For us in Alaska, this has been quite significant. Whether you’re in a small village and you’re putting in some solar or the effort to advance more more wind, whether it’s up in Kotzebue, I mean, these are significant. And quite honestly, I was very concerned about doing any backsliding on these investments. So this was, again, a measure that I’ve been leading, or co-leading for quite some time. We made some progress. It’s not as much as I would like, on wind and solar. Because we know that even though we’re an oil and gas producing state, you’ve got to take advantage of the resources that you have around you. And if it’s wind, and if it’s solar, and it’s battery, you can make a difference in a diesel-powered community.
So we were able to get — they had planned to terminate … the wind and solar credits right away, and we were able to get that pushed back to commence construction, yeah, it’s basically a one-year safe harbor. So I would have liked if it was (extended) to the end of the calendar year, but we did get that one year of safe harbor. So we’ve looked at the Alaska-specific projects, and there are a good number of them that would qualify there. So again, it’s not all we wanted. It could have been worse. 
One of the things that I think we did that was significant, literally, the night before we took this up, an excise tax on wind and solar was inserted, literally air-dropped into the bill. Which I didn’t really appreciate, but that was stripped out completely, so at least we don’t have to deal with that.  And then on the Alaska-specific issues, we got within the NPR-A (National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska), the coastal plain (of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and Cook Inlet — it was additional leases in these areas. There was some language regarding terms and conditions for acreage. You know that we had been working on a revenue-sharing proposal for the state. It would have been great to have been able to keep 90-10 (split between state and federal revenue) but parts of it were “Byrd-ed” out. So we ended up with a 70-30. Now that’s a perspective going forward, so it wouldn’t come into play until year nine of this bill. So I don’t know what year that is — 2034, OK. And even though it is prospective, this is on all of the, on all of these areas within NPR-A, coastal plain and Cook Inlet that we will have the 70-30 revenue sharing.
James Brooks, Alaska Beacon: Joe, is it possible that you or someone else on staff could get us the language around the SNAP changes for Alaska and any Medicare changes?
Joe Plesha: You bet.
Sen. Murkowski: James, I think what we need to do, because so much of this literally was laid down publicly for the first time within, I mean, just about six hours ago — so there’s a lot of this that folks just don’t have, much less been walked through. And so I think what we need to do is just put together a list for you. I think that that would be helpful, because Alaskans want to know, and I think that we can make that available for you.
James Brooks: That would be great, I’d appreciate that, because I think there’s a lot of uncertainty. I’ve had state legislators texting me and say, “Hey, can you let us know? Because we need to budget for these changes.”
Sen. Murkowski: Yes, and that has been my concern throughout, and that was why it was so important to get the delay. Because if you are looking at, you know, a $40 million hit, and it’s coming next year, that’s attention-getting. And fortunately for us, there is a two-year delay. And then again, if we are making progress towards reducing that (SNAP) error rate and coming into compliance, we can get a delay until 2030. So that gives planning time. And then with a couple hundred, you know, $300 million practically, coming to the state, granted, in different funds and pots. But that’s what we need to be doing – working with the Legislature and getting the commitment from the governor that you’re going to address this, so that we don’t pay because we continue to have a higher penalty due to the error rate. So we got to get that rate down. But that’s going to require people working at the Division of Public Assistance. It’s going to require work by the state to go out in these communities and be effectively a community navigator to help people understand that. 
Now you know these are how you have to account for meeting these work requirements. So the more time we can get to this, the better it is. And the more the state will be able to plan. And my hope is that it’s not just delaying a bad price tag, but that we will be able to really get our numbers down, and so we’re not paying for the penalties. We are working to make sure that eligible Alaskans are able to qualify for the benefits that they and their family need.  
All: Thank you.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.



It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-07-02 01:59:29+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Tackling housing costs, smart use of AI among top priorities for Mass. business leaders",JD Chesloff and Lisa Murray,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/tackling-housing-costs-smart-use-of-ai-among-top-priorities-for-mass-business-leaders/,"
If we move quickly and collaboratively, Massachusetts has the chance not just to adapt to the new environment—but to lead, and find opportunity in these uncertain times.
The post Tackling housing costs, smart use of AI among top priorities for Mass. business leaders appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MASSACHUSETTS WAS RECENTLY ranked as having the best economy in the country by WalletHub, which cited our investments in both industry and academic R&D, and leadership in innovation, workforce, and technology as factors leading to “big payoffs in economic growth.”   
In a recent survey of members of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable – CEOs and senior executives from some of the largest employers throughout the Commonwealth – business leaders similarly cite access to world class talent, industry clusters, and research institutions as important factors influencing their decisions to grow and invest in Massachusetts.  
Yet the survey —conducted annually for the past five years in collaboration with McKinsey & Company—also found cracks in our foundation, primarily due to the high cost of housing, cost of doing business, and the quality of our infrastructure, all made worse by federal policy uncertainty.  
More than 84 percent of employers expect national challenges to worsen the state’s economy, citing the threat of recession, the impact of trade and tariffs, and changes in federal policy as top concerns. The uncertainty caused by the constant churn of federal policy change has caused a quarter of respondents to put new investment and hiring decisions on hold, and more than half tabling plans to move, expand or change their footprint in the next year. 
Housing, in particular, is top of mind, with 74 percent of respondents indicating that it is negatively impacting their ability to recruit and retain talent. The most cited challenge in recruiting was employees’ higher expectations for compensation due to the high cost of living, and 73 percent of employers have already increased compensation as a result.  
The cost of living has become a cost of doing business issue in Massachusetts. Over 85 percent of employers now report having at least some staff based outside Massachusetts—up from approximately 75 percent last year and 70 percent the year before. Hybrid and remote work have become lasting elements in the talent strategy playbook. 
To address these headwinds, employers are embracing more talent-friendly policies and deploying AI to continue boosting productivity. More than half are increasing salary and benefits, offering professional development opportunities, and settling on flexible, hybrid work arrangements. In fact, 90 percent do not expect any additional changes in their work model. Regarding AI, more than two-thirds of employers are focused on AI and technology solutions to improve performance. Notably, more than 80 percent believe AI will actually support hiring and retention in Massachusetts. 
The key takeaway from this year’s survey is that in these uncertain times, there is great opportunity to think and collaborate in new and innovative ways. AI adoption, for example, is scaling rapidly, with 35 percent of respondents anticipating AI being a top trend impacting their business over the next year, up from 23 percent last year and 11 percent the year before.  
Half of the survey respondents see expanding workforce development programs to build a stronger AI talent pipeline and continuing to foster AI adoption in key industries as the greatest opportunities for Massachusetts. The Massachusetts AI Hub, created through the MassLeads Act, is already helping to jumpstart implementation of many of these strategies, and the Business Roundtable is working closely with them on education and workforce strategies. 
The Roundtable recently partnered with Citizens to convene a discussion at MassChallenge on “Future-Proofing Massachusetts’ Innovation Economy.” In a flash poll at that event, nearly three-quarters of the audience said they think the region already has the talent it needs to boost innovation, but panelists noted that the region is losing talent as founders start companies here but grow them elsewhere. That means the challenge, and the opportunity, are clear. The state has a robust pipeline to build on, and we need to be intentional about how we continue to do so. 
There is also opportunity to foster new partnerships and alliances of unlikely allies coming together to solve problems. Nearly three fourths of Roundtable members surveyed expressed interest in partnering with other companies and/or state government to tackle competitiveness challenges.  
In areas of AI adoption, workforce development, and job creation, there is the opportunity to, as one Roundtable member said, “reset the working relationship between companies and the state, so that each side contributes to problem solving together.” In Massachusetts, this is what we do – and have always done – best. 
In that spirit, the Roundtable recently joined with our colleagues from the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, and Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation to come together around a framework of competitiveness, convey our urgent focus on ensuring that Massachusetts can compete in an increasingly uncertain global economy, and offer our continued collaboration with state policy makers “as we pursue our shared goal of making Massachusetts a highly desirable place to live, work, and do business.” Encouragingly, productive conversations with the Healey-Driscoll administration and Legislature have followed.   
The vulnerability of the foundations of the Massachusetts economy, and the uncertainty of the moment we are in, is unsettling and threatening. This moment demands that private and public sectors collaborate as we conceive of new and innovative ways to keep Massachusetts competitive.  
As a Roundtable member urged, “The federal government’s retreat from key sectors, while very regrettable, gives the state an opportunity to step up and be a national leader in global industries, secure our leadership role in life sciences, and work together toward establishing the state as a leader in areas such as clean tech and AI.”  
If we move quickly and collaboratively, Massachusetts has the chance not just to adapt to the new environment—but to lead, and find opportunity in these uncertain times. 
JD Chesloff is the president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, a public policy organization comprised of CEOs and senior executives from large employers across the Commonwealth with the mission to make Massachusetts the most desirable place to live, work, and do business. Lisa Murray is the Massachusetts state president for Citizens, and chair of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable board of directors.

Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski joined 48 other Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday to pass a major budget bill that cuts federal assistance programs in order to partially pay for the extension of large tax cuts, weighted toward the wealthy.
Even with those cuts, the bill is expected to increase the national debt by more than $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years.
The final vote was 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaker. Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, but three Republicans joined all of the Senate’s Democrats in voting against the bill, requiring Vance’s tiebreaking act.
The U.S. House may vote on the Senate bill as soon as Wednesday. If it approves the bill, it would go to President Donald Trump, who supports it. If the House votes down the Senate proposal, lawmakers would have to craft a compromise between the Senate bill and one passed earlier by the House.
Murkowski had been considered a deciding vote on the Senate version of the bill. By phone, she said an “accumulation of different initiatives” caused her to vote for it.
She wanted to see the continuation of tax cuts, enacted in 2017 during the first term of President Donald Trump.
“I wanted to see those continued. That’s significant,” she said, emphasizing that the cuts affect all income levels.
She cited as an example an extension of the child tax credit, which lowers taxes for families with children, and no taxes on overtime or tips. Both of those items made it into the bill.
“The challenge was — and we saw it on the House side and we saw it here in the Senate — the challenge was, where do you pay for those?” Murkowski said.
Health care bound for cuts, but Alaska could be shielded
For senators, Medicaid cuts were a partial answer. 
Roughly 1 in 3 Alaskans receives health care through Medicaid, a federal-state program for people with low incomes, as well as the primary payer for most nursing home residents. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank opposed to the big bill, estimated that 35,000 Alaskans would lose health insurance if the bill becomes law, both from Medicaid and from a scaling-back in tax credits to pay for individual health insurance.
Sullivan said he believes estimates of the cuts’ effect are inaccurate when it comes to Alaska.
For example, one change would effectively lower payments to providers by reducing a tax on providers that is reimbursed by the federal government. 
“We are the only state that doesn’t use provider taxes or state directed payments, so the Medicaid programs and federal funds that the state receives are not impacted by the provided tax reforms in this bill, because we don’t do that,” he said.
Murkowski and Sullivan sought more than $6 billion in Alaska-specific Medicaid funding to offset any remaining consequences here, but those provisions were rejected by the Senate’s parliamentarian as violations of the rules, known as Byrd rules after the senator who sponsored them.
“We fought very hard, and the provision that we had written did not comply with the Byrd test, and so we had to go back and rewrite it, not once, not twice, but I think maybe three, maybe it was four times,” Murkowski said. 











I had a little bit of a dark night of the soul when that happened.


– U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, on the removal of an increase in federal Medicaid payments in Alaska



	Sullivan said he repeatedly tried to get approval for an amendment that would increase the federally paid portion of Alaska’s Medicaid program, but Democratic senators objected to that idea, causing the parliamentarian to review and reject it.
“I had a little bit of a dark night of the soul when that happened,” Sullivan said.
In the end, Alaska will share a $50 billion rural hospital fund. Murkowski said that and other funding in the bill would result in about $300 million per year to the state, partially offsetting the cuts in the bill.
Sullivan suggested the figure may be closer to $200 million.
That money could prevent five Alaska hospitals — in Valdez, Seward, Kodiak, Cordova and Ketchikan — from closing because of the cuts within the bill. All five were among 338 nationwide considered to be at risk if the bill becomes law.
Adult Alaskans who receive Medicaid will be required to work, volunteer or undergo job training for at least 20 hours per week unless they are sick, have children or care for older people.
Sullivan said he supports that requirement and noted that Alaska Natives are exempt, as are people who live in places with high unemployment, have mental health problems or are pregnant.
New limits on food aid for poorer Alaskans
The bill imposes work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, and it requires states to partially fund the program.
Alaska will be exempted from that state cost share for two years, Murkowski said, and if the state continues to reduce the number of applications flagged for errors — the highest in the country — that pause could be extended.
“I worked my butt off to make sure that Alaskans were not going to be penalized and were not going to be harmed,” she said.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that without the pause, Alaska would have to pay $37 million per year to keep food aid steady.
The federal government already mandates that “able-bodied adults” work in order to receive food aid, and the new bill extends that requirement to people as old as 64, up from the current age-54 limit.
Parents with children under 14 are exempt, as are pregnant people, Alaska Natives and people “medically certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment.”
Other Alaska additions
Parts of the bill add a new tax exemption for Community Development Quota fishing groups and increase a federal tax deduction for whaling captains.
The bill contains more than $7 billion for Coast Guard icebreakers and $300 million to homeport a newly purchased civilian icebreaker commissioned into Coast Guard service. That ship is expected to be based in Juneau.
The bill mandates four new oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it requires other sales in Cook Inlet and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. 
A growing proportion of the North Slope’s oil production is coming from NPR-A, rather than state-owned land near Prudhoe Bay. Two previous ANWR lease sales have drawn little interest from oil and gas companies.
Seventy percent of rental and royalty payments from NPR-A and ANWR lease sales would go to the state government, starting in 2034. That’s up from 50% currently.
An earlier version of the bill had 90% of the revenue going to the state.
Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, a North Slope nonprofit that supports oil drilling, praised the new leases, while Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, which opposes drilling, denounced them, as did various environmental groups.
The final version of the bill eliminated a Republican proposal to tax new solar and wind power plants, and it allows new clean energy facilities to claim federal tax credits as long as they begin construction in the near future.
“We’ve looked at the Alaska-specific projects, and there are a good number of them that would qualify there,” Murkowski said. “It’s not all we wanted. It could have been worse.”
A prior version of the bill would have ended the tax credit incentives immediately.
Sullivan had doubts, too
While Murkowski has been dubbed the deciding vote on the bill, any other Republican senator could have killed the bill, including Sullivan.
Until senators added the energy provisions and the SNAP and Medicaid carveouts for Alaska, Sullivan was undecided about whether he would vote for the bill, said his spokesperson, Amanda Coyne. 
When the Senate failed to adopt his proposal to increase the federally funded share of Alaska’s Medicaid program, Sullivan said he was enormously disappointed.
“I’m not sure it was a moment where I was going to say, ‘I’m not going to do this,’ but it was a moment of enormous disappointment. … I feel very passionate about it, and I was close, and it slipped away from me.”
Planned Parenthood medical services cut
A non-Alaska-specific portion of the bill bans Medicaid from paying for any services at Planned Parenthood.
Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, said by email that the provision puts millions of lives at risk across the country.
“Our health centers save Alaska nearly $5 million each year by preventing unplanned pregnancies, catching cancers early, and controlling the spread of STIs (sexually transmitted infections). Stripping that care away, especially now — amid rural hospital closures, a maternal mortality crisis, and a deepening provider shortage — would push an already broken system past the brink,” she said. 
Asked about that section, Sullivan said he thinks Alaskans have other options, such as hospitals and community health centers. 
Community health center leaders also have expressed concern about the bill’s effect, citing the loss of Medicaid revenue on their ability to maintain services.
Bill heads to U.S. House next
The Senate’s approval of the big budget bill isn’t the last step in the process. The U.S. House will vote as soon as Wednesday on whether or not to adopt the Senate’s proposal.
If the House votes it down, lawmakers would have to negotiate a compromise between the Senate version of the bill and one passed earlier by the House.
Murkowski said she hopes the House votes down the Senate version, allowing further work.
“I had to look on balance, because the people in my state are the ones that I put first,” Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill immediately after her vote. “We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination. My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we’re not there yet.”
That remark drew criticism from Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, during a hearing of the House Rules Committee later in the day. That committee met for a procedural vote to advance the Senate bill toward a vote on the House floor.
“My question to her is, if you really believe that, why the hell did you vote for this bill? It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a dereliction of your duty as a United States senator and a representative of the people of Alaska,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts. “When was the last time this current House of Representatives has fixed or solved anything?”
A spokesperson for Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, said the congressman’s office was still reviewing the Senate’s changes and didn’t have immediate comment.
Begich voted in favor of a prior version of the bill despite a campaign pledge to seek reductions to the federal debt.
In a phone interview afterward, he said he doubted the figures provided by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
A vote in the House could come this week. Trump has been asking lawmakers to vote before they leave for the Fourth of July holiday.
“To my GOP friends in the House: Stay UNITED, have fun, and Vote “YAY.” GOD BLESS YOU ALL!” Trump said on social media after the Senate voted.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington state Standard)Washington and Oregon’s attorneys general are suing the federal government for sharing residents’ Medicaid records with federal immigration enforcement officials.
Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, alongside 13 other Democratic state attorneys general, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for sharing Medicaid patients’ files with the Department of Homeland Security, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is housed. The Health and Human Services Department, it’s secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the Homeland Security Department and it’s secretary, Kristi Noem, are listed as defendants.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta is leading the lawsuit, which also includes the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.
The state attorneys argue that sharing personal health data violates federal administrative procedure laws and federal privacy laws. States are asking the court to block any new transfer of data, and the use of any data currently held by Homeland Security and ICE for immigration enforcement purposes.
Since Congress established Medicaid seven decades ago, “federal law, policy, and practice has been clear: the personal healthcare data collected about beneficiaries of the program is confidential,” officials from Brown’s office said in a news release.
On June 13, the state attorneys general learned through news reports that officials at the Health and Human Services Department transferred Medicaid data files to ICE officials. Those reports indicate that the federal government plans to create a database for mass deportations and other large-scale immigration enforcement purposes, Brown said in a news release.
“Washington residents expect that the confidential information they give to the government to access medical treatment will only be used for healthcare purposes,” Brown said in a news release. “Their data should not go towards creating a giant database of Americans’ personal information or used so that ICE can deport undocumented immigrants because they had to go to the doctor.”
Oregon and Washington are among seven states that offer Medicaid to eligible adults regardless of immigration status, and are among 14 states, plus Washington, D.C., that cover children regardless of immigration status. Oregon has 100,000 people enrolled in its “Healthier Oregon” program, a state-funded program which provides access to Medicaid coverage regardless of immigration status, according to the Oregon Health Authority. About 49,000 people of the nearly 2 million people in Washington who rely on the state’s Medicaid Program Apple Health have an immigration status that makes them ineligible for federal funding.
“This has a chilling impact on people who need healthcare in our country,” Rayfield said in the news release. “Parents may choose not to take their kids to the doctor because they’re afraid of what may happen. We need to protect the privacy and dignity of every person who calls Oregon home.”

The heart of the nearly 1,000-page legislation extends and expands the 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level and establishes permanent tax breaks for business investments as well as research and development costs. The tax cuts are estimated to cost nearly $4.5 trillion over 10 years.
The bill also blocks Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and shifts significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time. Sustaining Georgia’s current SNAP program is projected to cost the state $812 million annually.
Because the bill was amended in the Senate, it will have to return to the House for another vote before it can advance to the president’s desk.
  Sen. Jon Ossoff condemned the GOP’s signature tax break and spending cuts package, which narrowly passed the Senate after more than 24 hours of continuous debate. Screenshot.
Georgia’s two senators, Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, condemned the bill’s passage, and urged members of the House to oppose the legislation.
“The Senate just voted for legislation that will kick millions off their health care, close rural hospitals, and increase health care costs for everyone, all to give billionaires a tax break,” Warnock said in a statement. “Today’s vote is a disappointing reminder that Washington politicians aren’t working for ordinary people.”
Ossoff, who is running for re-election in 2026, also emphasized the impact that the bill’s cuts will have on Georgia’s access to health care across the state.
“This bill is a trillion dollar cut to Medicaid,” he told reporters shortly after the bill passed out of the Senate. “Seventy percent of Georgia seniors in nursing homes are on Medicaid. Half of all births in Georgia are covered by Medicaid. Forty percent of all children in Georgia are covered by Medicaid, and I have been warning for months that this gutting of the Medicaid program puts Georgia seniors, Georgia mothers, Georgia children at risk.”
Reduced access to health insurance coverage is one of the biggest factors opponents of the bill have seized on, and one that could have downstream effects throughout America’s entire health care system. According to a report from KFF Health News, an estimated 310,000 people across Georgia would lose access to health insurance by 2034 under the bill, due to changes the bill imposes on both Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage. That number could rise to 750,000 if Congress allows enhanced tax credits for those insured through the ACA to expire this year.
Health care experts also warn that the bill could have devastating consequences for Georgia hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, where health care providers rely on funding from Medicaid to sustain their facilities.

According to a report from researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, four hospitals in rural Georgia are at risk of reducing services or closing altogether under the megabill: Fannin Regional Hospital in Blue Ridge, Flint River Community Hospital in Montezuma, Irwin County Hospital in Ocilla, and Washington County Regional Medical Center in Sandersville. Three of those hospitals are in districts represented by Republican congressmen who voted in favor of the bill.
Last week, the Georgia Hospital Association signed a letter alongside hospital associations from 13 other states urging Senator Majority Leader John Thune to preserve and strengthen Medicaid in the Senate’s version of the legislation.
“Stable funding is vital not only for serving Medicaid beneficiaries but also for providing care to all patients, including the uninsured, those with commercial insurance, and our seniors and disabled patients on Medicare,” the letter states. “Severe cuts to Medicaid inevitably would lead to cuts in healthcare services for all Americans.”
Though the bill was later amended to include a $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals, critics of the bill worry that the money will not be enough to offset the strain rural providers will face due to sweeping Medicaid cuts. Rural hospitals in Georgia are projected to lose $540 million over the next 10 years, according to a report from the American Hospital Association.
The House is expected to take another vote on the bill this week to meet President Donald Trump’s imposed July 4 deadline for passing the legislation. However, if the House amends the bill further, it will have to return to the Senate for another vote.

John McCosh/Georgia RecorderThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
After six bill increases in the last three years, Georgia Power rates will now stay the same for the time being. 
Under a deal approved Tuesday by the Georgia Public Service Commission, Georgia Power’s rates will stay the same for the next three years, though the deal does not include some costs, which could still cause bills to increase next year.
“The rate freeze resulting from this plan is a great result for customers,” Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said in a statement, “balancing the mutual benefits of extraordinary economic growth among all stakeholders and helping to ensure that we remain equipped to continue supporting growth in this state.” 
Under the agreement reached by Georgia Power and the commission’s staff and later cosigned by the Georgia Association of Manufacturers and Utility Management Services, the base rates that help determine power bills will remain the same for three years – except for the cost of recovering from Hurricane Helene, the most damaging storm in Georgia Power’s history. 
Georgia Power is also scheduled to review the cost of fuels such as coal and natural gas next year, which could also drive bills up – though company officials said lower fuel prices could lead to lower bills, or at least cancel out extra costs from Helene. 
“Customers have seen unprecedented inflation in the energy sector across the U.S.,” said commission chair Jason Shaw in a statement. “My fellow Commissioners and I urged staff and Georgia Power to come to some agreement where base rates would not increase. This is nothing but good news for Georgia Power ratepayers.” 
Some critics were less certain. The rate freeze deal bypasses the typically intensive, months-long process of setting rates, during which interested parties – including energy and consumer advocates, municipalities, large power users like MARTA and Walmart and even the federal government – comb through Georgia Power’s finances and proposals. Without those hearings, some have argued, it’s impossible to know if the rate freeze is the best possible deal for customers.
“Every day Georgians cannot be on the hook for Georgia Power’s data center spending spree,” said Bob Sherrier, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, in a statement. “The next three years are very consequential for the electric grid and deserve much more scrutiny than occurred here.”  
Critics of the deal also worried that “rate freeze” is a misnomer because of the adjustment for storm costs that will happen next year. Others raised concerns that by deferring costs to keep rates the same now, the plan will result in an even larger rate hike in 2028. 
Georgia Power officials denied both concerns in hearings last week. They argued that lower fuel costs could balance out the storm costs, leaving rates the same or even lower, and that savings from cost deferrals would extend beyond the next three years.
Commissioner Bubba McDonald objected to the current power rates – the rates now being extended – when they were approved in 2022 because he felt Georgia Power’s profits were set too high. He reiterated that objection Tuesday and proposed a motion to lower the utility’s profit cap, but no other commissioners seconded the proposal and it died without a vote.
In the end, McDonald joined his fellow commissioners in voting for the rate freeze, and it passed unanimously.

Additional orders are expected to follow to replace more than a dozen other aging vessels in the fleet. (Photo by Tom Banse)For the first time in more than 50 years, Washington State Ferries will contract with an out-of-state shipyard to build new vessels. 
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson made the final call to accept the low bid from Florida-based Eastern Shipbuilding Group to build three new hybrid electric ferries, each capable of carrying up to 160 cars and 1,500 passengers. The vessels will replace aging boats in the state fleet.
Ferguson passed over a considerably more expensive bid from in-state shipyard Nichols Brothers Boat Builders. Whidbey Island-based Nichols Brothers and a range of allies from around the north Puget Sound lobbied the governor unsuccessfully to split the contract for the new ferries to secure local jobs and boost the region’s shipbuilding industry.
“After careful consideration and conversations with legislative leaders, I believe Eastern is the best option to build these critically important vessels at a fair cost to our taxpayers,” Ferguson said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
The state accepted Eastern Shipbuilding’s bid of $714.5 million for three new ferries, with deliveries estimated to begin in 2029. 
However, the total cost to taxpayers will be much higher because the state plans to purchase the hybrid electric powertrain separately and made allowances for construction oversight, early delivery incentives and change orders. Ferguson’s office said this brings the cost of the first vessel to approximately $405 million, the second to $360 million, and the third to $325 million. The cost and risks decrease with lessons learned from each previous build.
Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, supported Ferguson’s decision to go with the low bid.
“The budget constraints we face — combined with rising construction costs driven by tariffs and inflation — mean we must make the most of every taxpayer dollar to deliver the ferries we urgently need,” he said, adding it won’t be the last boats built. “I’m confident Washington’s shipbuilders will have many more opportunities to compete for and win future contracts.”
Civic and business leaders in Washington urged the governor to choose Nichols Brothers and its sister yard, Everett Ship Repair, arguing that Ferguson should consider the jobs that would be created and economic benefits derived from using an in-state contractor. 
“This is very disappointing news for the working men and women in Snohomish and Island counties and the state of Washington,” said Ray Stephanson, president and CEO of Economic Alliance Snohomish County.
The Washington Legislature previously set aside about $1.3 billion to build new ferries over the next six to eight years. Money is not the only consideration. The ferry system and the state’s Democratic leadership want to reduce the ferries’ air pollution footprint by switching to battery propulsion as much as possible, too.
Eastern Shipbuilding Group submitted the low bid for the state’s desired plug-in hybrid vessels, according to a summary of the bids posted by Washington State Ferries in mid-May. The price tag (without the state-supplied powertrains) was roughly in line with the state engineer’s in-house estimate.
The Panama City, Florida-based company has experience building car ferries for numerous other governments, including in North Carolina, Florida and the Staten Island line in New York. The three new Staten Island ferries were delivered late due first to hurricane damage in 2018 to the shipyard and then to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nichols Brothers submitted a competing bid that was considerably higher, even after including a 13% credit authorized by the Legislature to incentivize home state construction.
A third shipbuilder, Philly Shipyard, was expected to bid, but didn’t in the end. Seattle shipyard Vigor Marine, which built all of the state’s new ferries since the late 1970s, also chose not to bid. After the state got to loggerheads with Vigor over a ferry construction contract extension around five years ago, the Legislature directed the ferry system to solicit bids from shipyards nationwide for the first time in decades.
The Nichols Brothers and Eastern Shipbuilding bids both included escalator clauses that state House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey predicted in May would push prices higher. The escalators put Washington taxpayers on the hook to pay for unpredictable cost increases, such as rising steel prices or tariffs.
‘Real disappointment’ at in-state shipyard
Nichols Brothers CEO Gavin Higgins said his company would not appeal the contract award to his Florida competitor. But he made it clear in an interview Tuesday that he felt “real disappointment” that the state missed the boat to grow its shipbuilding industry and invest in the next generation of apprentice builders.
“We’ve lost the opportunity to hire over 1,300 people and bring them to work. Who’s going to do it now,” Higgins said.
In May, after the state made the ferry bids public, Higgens wrote a follow-up letter to Ferguson to propose a split contract. He laid out a “best case scenario” in which Eastern would build two new ferries in Florida and Nichols Brothers would simultaneously build two more in-state. Higgins said a good chunk of the added cost of building in Washington would be offset by tax collections on the business activity generated by the enhanced local shipbuilding industry.
“I think we made a pretty strong case,” Higgins said, before adding that the “headwinds” posed by the state’s union-level wage and apprentice utilization requirements, small business and veteran set-asides, strict environmental rules and a mandatory DEI officer added costs that could not be overcome.
Cost roughly tripled over past seven years
The 144-car Suquamish was the most recent of the workhorse Olympic-class ferries upon which the new plug-in ferry design is based. The diesel-powered Suquamish was delivered to WSF in 2018 at a cost of about $122 million. Debate about how to proceed with further vessel acquisitions in that size class has stretched from then until now. 
During this dickering, the state pivoted to electrification, costs shot up and the reliability of the existing aging fleet went down.
The bid request published by WSF included the high-level design for a plug-in ferry. Drawings show 460-foot-long boats that resemble a slightly elongated version of the diesel-powered Olympic class ferries delivered between 2014 and 2018. However, the new design has just one passenger deck stacked on top of the two auto decks.
The center of the ship’s hold will be packed with racks of water-cooled rechargeable batteries so the ferry can sail fully on electric power most of the time. The engine room will also feature twin diesel generators as a backup source of propulsion. 
Assuming they use green electricity to charge, the new ferries should achieve a large reduction in fuel consumption and an associated reduction in global warming emissions.
WSF tentatively plans to deploy the new ferries to the Mukilteo-Clinton run first, probably followed by the Seattle-Bremerton route.
What about cheaper options?
Republicans, who are in the minority in the Legislature, pushed unsuccessfully for a cheaper diesel ferry option to be put back on the table. Washington State Ferries leaders have been consistent in warning against reverting to conventional diesel power because that would necessitate a lengthy redesign and re-bid.
BC Ferries has also been in the market for new car ferries and has been able to acquire new vessels at far lower cost. Unlike Washington State Ferries, BC Ferries can solicit bids from shipyards worldwide. This past month, the privatized provincial ferry company stirred considerable controversy at home by announcing it would contract with a Chinese shipyard to acquire four large new car ferries. BC Ferries declined to specify the price, but made clear that no other bidders came close to the cost savings the Chinese state-owned yard offered.
Building ferries to serve domestic U.S. routes at a foreign shipyard is prohibited under a century-old federal law known as the Jones Act. 
Of late, the Trump administration and a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers in Congress have highlighted the need to make the American shipbuilding industry more competitive. But President Donald Trump’s recent statements on the matter make no mention of jettisoning the longstanding made-in-America requirements.
Washington State Ferries currently has 21 vessels of various sizes and ages in its fleet, making it the largest public ferry system in the nation. The agency’s long-range plan contains a goal to grow to 26 ferries to provide reliable service on every route, with allowances for maintenance tie-ups and a vessel in reserve. 
This summer, the ferry system will get nearly back to operating its full pre-pandemic schedule, missing only a second boat on the Port Townsend-Coupeville run during midweeks and the long-suspended international crossing to Sidney, B.C.

(John Cole/Capital-Star)Amy Brickner, a third-generation dairy farmer and owner of Destiny Dairy Bar in Cumberland County, has been able to partner with the Safe Harbour shelter in Carlisle over the past two years to provide milk to people in need. 
The effort is part of a federal initiative known as the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program or LFPA.
Brickner opened the Dairy Bar in 2022 and says it accounts for 10% of her farm’s market share. She looks at the initiative as a win-win.

“At the beginning, I was dumping a lot of milk, and then I started getting pigs. And so I was able to feed the milk to pigs. But it was still bottles and labels and labor that went to waste that didn’t get used,” she said. “So, I was approached by a friend of mine….(who)  got me hooked up with Safe Harbor. They would come out here once a week, and any milk that was close dated, but it was still shelf stable for another week, it would go to that program, and they would give it to their residents.”
The program was established under President Joe Biden’s administration in 2021 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 189 Pennsylvania farms, just like Brickner’s, are participants and provide products to 14 food banks across the state.
Last December, the Biden administration announced that its contract with the commonwealth was being renewed for three years and $13 million. LFPA has provided nearly $30 million in funding to participating Pennsylvania farms to provide fresh, locally grown products to food banks since 2022, according to Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office.
However, the Trump administration announced in March that they were ending the program, arguing it was created via executive authority under the previous administration and “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As a result, Brickner says it’s been more difficult to make ends meet as well as contribute to the shelter and the Salvation Army.
“I’m very strapped from a cash flow standpoint, not having that extra 10% come in has been pretty tough,” Brickner told the Capital-Star. “It’s hard to pay my bills sometimes, and I’ve bootstrapped this all on my own.”
Brickner said she’s still donating milk to Safe Harbour every other week, despite the cancellation of the program, because the connection “has been so amazing.” She vows to continue to do so until she can’t make it work economically.

Shapiro, state Agriculture Sec. Russell Redding, and all four chairs of the General Assembly’s agriculture committees (two Republicans and two Democrats), visited Destiny Dairy Bar this week to tour the farm, tout the benefits of the program, and urge the Trump administration to reconsider cancelling it.
“I think it’s important to note that we are all here together,” Shapiro said. “We work together closely to support agriculture in Pennsylvania, and we have all stood together in supporting the LFPA program, which is incredibly important to support places like this and the food banks that they provide their product to.”
“This is an example of what should be occupying people’s attention, Republicans and Democrats working together to support one of the principal industries,” he added. 
Since the cancellation of the program, Shapiro has been front and center at various locations throughout the commonwealth detailing his support for it. The LFPA initiative works as a reimbursement program and the state doesn’t get the federal funding until after it pays farmers and provides receipts.
Early last month, Shapiro announced that his administration filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg asking a judge to reverse the federal Department of Agriculture’s decision to cancel its contract with Pennsylvania.
“We had to pursue a legal remedy. I wish we didn’t, and we’re going to work through that process,” Shapiro told reporters on Monday.
A USDA spokesperson previously told the Capital-Star, shortly after the lawsuit was filed, that the agency does not “comment on pending litigation,” and directed inquiries to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Shapiro has said the LFPA funding represents between 10% and 15% of the annual market share for  a lot of other participating farmers.
State Sen. Judy Schwank, a Democrat and minority chair of the chamber’s Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, said that in her research, the Helping Harvest food bank serving Berks and Schuylkill counties has lost about 15% of the funds they were previously receiving as a result of the cancellation.
On June 18, Rep. Dan Moul, a Republican from Adams County and minority chair of the House Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, penned a letter with the signatures of the other chairs of the Ag panels to the state’s congressional delegation. It urged them to push the federal government to reinstate the funds.
“Given the administration’s stated commitment to supporting small farmers and improving public health through better nutrition, we believe the LFPA program clearly aligns with national priorities and should be continued,” the letter reads.

Moul said that “this program should have been left intact.”
“We all need agriculture. We all need the help, and we need to put this funding back where it belongs,” he added.
Speaking to the Capital-Star following the tour, Moul stressed the chairs of the committees that were on hand are not part of the lawsuit filed by the Shapiro administration, but took part to discuss the benefits of LFPA.
“We’re here to say this is a vital program for Pennsylvania,” Moul said. “Pennsylvania agriculture and the food banks, and in the scheme of things, the money that was taken away is such a small speck in comparison to our federal budget.”
“Why take it away?” Moul added. “It’s agriculture. It’s food. It’s not money being wasted. This money goes to a good, good cause, and it helps people.”
Shapiro has previously said the state doesn’t have the money to backfill the federal cuts, if the lawsuit is unsuccessful.
Moul told the Capital-Star that the legislature could pass a resolution asking the federal government to restore the funding, noting the bipartisan support outlined in the letter should resonate with the state’s congressional delegation.
“I know when they got that letter, when their staff got that letter, they said, ‘Hey, all four chairman of agriculture here in Pennsylvania want this funding put back. Let’s fight for it,’” Moul said. “And that’s what we’re hoping for.”
Moul said that he’s good friends with U.S. Rep. John Joyce (R-13th Distric), and that if he doesn’t see action soon, he will lobby on behalf of restoring the program.
“I will call him personally and say, ‘Hey, John, I want you to do me a favor. Would you go, would you go to D.C. and fight to get this funding restored?’”” Moul said. “I think that’s where a hatchet was used and when it should have been a scalpel.”

Conversations around the reconciliation bill have dominated the discourse for members of the U.S. House and Senate over recent weeks. Noting that, along with the letter only being sent recently and the holiday weekend coming up, Moul said that federal lawmakers have other things on their mind.
“But as soon as that’s over, as soon as the holiday’s behind us, that’s when we’re going to have to pound on it a little bit more,” Moul said. “I’ll start making phone calls.”
Another influential member in regards to agricultural policy at the federal level is U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-15th District). The Centre County Republican serves as the House Chair on the Committee on Agriculture.
Moul said that he’s friends with Thompson as well and said he’d contact him.
“He has a lot of pull,” Moul said. “Getting the funding restored, I think we can make it happen.”
Other elected leaders are also optimistic that the program will return.
“I think you know my track record on these legal processes,” Shapiro said. “We win these, because the law is on our side.”
“They had a contract with the good people of Pennsylvania. This was a clear three-year contract,” he added. “They broke it four months in, and I feel confident that we’re going to get there at the end of the day.”
Brickner said she has faith in the lawmakers taking on the fight to ensure she can continue to assist those in her community who are in need, without her business suffering financially.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dairy_cows_carlisle_720.jpg,,,2025-07-01 21:03:02.603047

With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall. 
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the Naitonal Park Service. 
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget. 
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system. 
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates. 
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors. 
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”

The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said. 
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks. 
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents. 
The same model could easily be applied nationally. 
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.” 
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees. 
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation. 
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue. 
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
  Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue 

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries. 
  A chart showing possible scenarios of increasing entrance fees at Yellowstone National Park. Graphic by PERC
The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years. 
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue. 
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue. 
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors. 
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said. 
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said. 
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right. 
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said. 
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.

“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Yellowstone-National-Park-sign-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-07-01 21:03:02.603047

(Photo by Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded. 
On Tuesday, Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.  
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Utah will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with. 
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028. 
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.  
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases. 
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended to 1990 (previously, just uranium workers in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming and Utah were covered, with a timeframe ending in 1971).

“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.” 
RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered. 
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985. 
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.

“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.” 
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns. 
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-522294832-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-01 20:03:45.697863

(Photo by Amanda Mustard for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star).Pennsylvania would ban the sale of firefighting foam containing so-called forever chemicals that have polluted groundwater in dozens of sites across the state, under legislation passed unanimously Tuesday in the state House.
The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Brian Munroe (D-Bucks), spoke on the floor about the illness and fear across his district as a result of drinking water polluted by firefighting chemicals used for decades at the former Naval Air Warfare Center in Warminster Township.
“Over those decades, Warminster and the surrounding communities grew. To provide water to these new communities … millions of dollars were spent on our public water system. As of 2015 the Warminster Municipal Authority served over 30,000 residents in Warminster alone.”
That’s when testing alerted officials and residents to the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, in groundwater that was being drawn from municipal wells and used in the community’s public water system. Warminster had three of the most polluted wells in the nation, Munroe noted.
PFAS are human-made chemicals that have also been used since the 1940s in a wide range of products including nonstick and weather-resistant coatings. Because they are slow to break down in the environment, PFAS have been dubbed forever chemicals and are found in the blood of people and animals around the world.

In addition to the cost of finding a new, safe source of drinking water, people were overcome by worry that the pollution was the cause of illness among neighbors throughout the community and that it could affect them in the future. 
“I can tell you from the thousands of conversations with parents and residents in the township, everyone has a story of cancer clusters in my neighborhood,” Munroe said. “I have heard of nightmare stories of children diagnosed with rare cancers. I have shared hugs with more people than I can count who have been recently dealt with the blow of receiving a cancer diagnosis — the horrific fear that hangs over every single street in Warminster Township.”
Munroe has been diagnosed with cancer twice himself, he said. While his family underwent blood testing to detect levels of PFAS in their bodies, Munroe said he was not tested because he is a firefighter. 
According to the National Institutes for Health, exposure to PFAS is an occupational hazard for firefighters. Sources include foam containing PFAS, but also turnout gear that contains the chemicals to make them more water and dirt resistant. Munroe’s bill would require manufacturers to label personal protective equipment that contains PFAS.
“We owe it to our fellow firefighters to allow them to make educated decisions about the PPE they use and the risk involving and being exposed to PFAs in firefighting gear,” Rep. Gregory Scott (D-Montgomery) said. “They deserve to know that the gear they’re using could potentially impact their health later in life.”
Because PFAS were flagged as cause for concern only in the last two decades, it’s still unclear how harmful these chemicals are, but scientific studies have repeatedly shown exposure imay be linked to harmful health effects including cancer, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Also used in foaming agents used to fight fires involving aircraft and aviation fuels, PFAs contamination is commonly found in groundwater in the areas around military bases. That includes the Naval Air Warfare Center in Bucks County, where the U.S. Navy began testing new aircraft and systems in the 1940s through the 1990s.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, PFAS have been found in at least one location in 19 counties. The EPA adopted drinking water regulations for six PFAS in 2024. It set the maximum contaminant level for two of the most common PFAS at 4 parts per trillion.
Munroe’s House Bill 1261 would ban the sale of firefighting foam containing PFAS, starting in 2026 and would ban the use of such products in 2027, with exceptions for federal requirements.
It would task the state fire commissioner with identifying alternative products and working with the DEP to dispose of leftover PFAS products after the ban takes effect. The bill would require the DEP to take and investigate complaints of violations and refer any  offenses to the state Attorney General. Violations could carry civil penalties of $5,000 to $10,000, which would be used for fire company and emergency medical service grants. 
H.B. 1261 now goes to the state Senate for consideration.

Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, with his stack of bills at the end of the 69th Montana Legislature. (Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)The problem didn’t start this year. In fact, it probably started, like so many things, around the COVID-19 pandemic when lawmakers had to figure out how to hold legislative meetings safely, without the spread of the virus.
But as the Montana Legislature has seen a record number of bill drafts, more interim committees in between legislative sessions, and implementation of a new database because the longtime computer server was nearly dead, the number of compensatory hours, — or additional work hours — Legislative Services Division employees have banked has ballooned to more than 15,000 hours.
The issue, first reported by the Montana Free Press, can be broken down in a number of ways. For perspective, 15,000 hours is roughly the equivalent of two-years’ worth of time. In a state department that numbers around 100, that translates to an additional work-month of time off for the average full-time employee, although the director of Legislative Services, Jerry Howe, notes that the comp time is not necessarily evenly distributed among all of its employees.
However, the burgeoning number of comp-time hours is an issue that continues to grow, and recently Howe and the Legislative Council, the bipartisan committee that manages the operations of the Legislature, met to talk about how to meet the challenge.
Comp time, which is used as a benefit to fairly treat staff members during the long and sometimes grueling legislative session held every two years for 90 days, is a tool to avoid what would be either an oversized staff or exorbitant overtime.
However, Montana law caps comp time at 120 hours per employee, Howe explained, and at the end of the year, any comp in excess of the equivalent of three full-time weeks off is wiped out, essentially shorting employees who have worked the hours but didn’t get compensated. That thought keeps Howe up at night.
“It’s not just that this happens every two years, for a busy session. It’s that we have people who work here their entire careers. Employee morale is my top concern,” he said. “I’ve got to figure out how we get our staff time to decompress, recharge the batteries and enjoy this beautiful state we all love.”
Montana Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said that he wants to make sure the state is fair to its employees who have worked such long hours at the behest of the lawmakers.
“They deserve to either have the vacation time or a buy-out,” he said.
One of the other compounding factors in this comp-time puzzle is that the additional time is already on top of normal benefits, like personal time off or vacation time.
  More work, same staff 

The causes for the comp time conundrum are multi-faceted: High numbers of bills introduced, high number of amendments, extra committees during the interim, and new technology, including remote meetings that take considerably more time and expertise to run.
For example, two special committees created after the 2023 session included one established to consider voting regulations and another to look at the state’s judiciary, a top priority for the Republican majority. Then, there was a special committee during the 2025 session that investigated former Senate President Jason Ellsworth for ethical violations. Howe told the Daily Montanan that the committee took huge staff time, amounting to more than 1,000 hours after it was completed.
During session, the Legislative Services Division wrestled with a new database to track and display the committee meetings, all the bills and their respective amendments. It replaced technology that had been in use for nearly two decades, but was on the verge of failing after the original software developer said that it would no longer be supporting it, causing Howe and his information-technology team to begin migrating to a new server and software that would normally be a four-year process. Instead, his team attempted to do it in 14 months.
Also, a lawsuit now before the Montana Supreme Court regarding whether junque files, which are the drafting files kept by Legislative Services for every bill and resolution introduced, are part of Montana’s public records. That lawsuit, which is being litigated in part by a coalition of media, including the Daily Montanan, has also taken considerable time, Howe said — one of many atypical but not necessarily rare occurrences that has contributed to the increase in comp time.
“None of those things can be put off,” Howe said. “One thing that impresses me about the Legislative Services staff is how dedicated they are to the legislators and the legislative process.”
Howe said Montana has experienced busy legislative sessions previously. It has experienced busy interims — the time between the legislative sessions. But, it has never experienced busy times back to back to back, seemingly without an end. That trend, Howe said, is new.
  No one solution, but several possible solutions 

Howe also identified four different options or “levers,” the Legislature has to address the problem, including adding full-time staff; buying out compensatory time; limiting the number of interim studies; or limiting the number of bill drafts or changing rules about bills requiring legislative hearing.
“We have these different levers we can pull, and we have to decide which ones to pull and when, and it will probably be a combination of all of them,” Howe said. “You don’t get into this situation with one really busy interim or one long session. They build up. They accrue.”
Previously, the Legislature has considered “buying back” the comp time, Howe said, but that measure failed this session. In 2023, the Legislature spent $325,000 to buy down comp time. This session, there was a proposal for “buying back” another $300,000, but that failed.
Regier has been both the Senate’s top leader as well as a former Montana Speaker of the House. As a part of the Legislative Council, he said lawmakers from both parties are wrestling with this issue.
He said unexpected things, like the thousand-plus hours of work for the “Ellsworth investigation,” were unforeseen.
“I hope to never have another ethics committee meeting again,” he said.
Instead, Regier said the problem of too much work is something that is being created by the Legislature, therefore the solution probably lies within the Legislature, as well.
He said that legislative leadership needs to better prioritize bills and amendments to bills — which take top priority during the busy legislative session.
“Our legislative staff has delivered. They have an incredible work ethic,” Regier said. “Sometimes, our lawmakers don’t know what they’re asking.”
For example, holding a remote session can take days of advance notice and technological hurdles for the IT department in order to ensure that public participation, mandated by state law, can be available virtually anywhere in the state.
Regier said even some very small changes could make big impacts. For example, as the legislative session winds down, some lawmakers have less to do — no new bills to introduce. Instead, they begin proposing topics for lawmakers to study when the Legislature is not in session. And the number of study bills and topics has ballooned. Regier suggested that simply walking back the deadline for interim study bills could help lighten the workload.
  Not just Montana 

Howe, who has worked for the Utah Legislature and stays in contact with counterparts from other states, especially those in the West, says the problem is one that many western states are experiencing as national issues bleed down into state politics.
Howe said that in a place that prides itself on being a “citizen Legislature,” many Montana lawmakers aren’t experts in law or even how state code works. Sometimes, ideas from constituents come to Legislative Services scrawled on the back of a napkin or scratch paper. But taking those ideas and changing laws through the state’s code can take weeks or months, even for ideas that seem straightforward.
“These ideas seem so easy,” Howe said. “But most people just don’t have the understanding of how laws relate to one another and how they are organized in code. Public policy is not a simple endeavor. If it were, we would not need to meet constantly and continuously.”
Some of the increase in work is also natural, Howe said. Montana, like many other states in the West after COVID, is growing. And that growth can challenge laws or aspects that haven’t been touched for years — if not, decades.
“The policies of the 1940s and ‘50s don’t work anymore, and the policy needs to adapt to that environment,” he said.
Some of the work increase is also related to term limits. Many lawmakers request fewer bill drafts and have a better handle on state law the longer they serve in the Legislature, Howe said. However, with term limits, legislative staff is often re-teaching or explaining the legal and legislative process to new members.
“People kind of hit their stride when they’re nearing the end of their limits,” Howe said.
Howe would love to believe that the long hours and the complex back-to-back-to-back sessions and their interims were an outlier, but he said as the appetite to legislate continues to be brisk, driven in part by national politics, he is also looking ahead. And Montana, like many other states, may be called into special session to patch budget holes created by Congress.
If that happens, there’ll be a sort of double-whammy: More demand for legislative services and less time to spend down comp time.
“We don’t know what is in the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and how will affect us,” Howe said. “But cuts in Congress could mean a special session in Montana as well as other states.”
And that translates to more staff time for Legislative Services.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4046.jpg,,,2025-07-01 20:03:45.697863

DemasMichigan State University will eliminate staff and faculty positions as part of the “next steps” the university will follow amid current financial issues.
In a public letter delivered by President Kevin M. Guskiewicz to the MSU faculty and staff, he argued these future job cuts that are starting in July will follow “external pressure” to the university finances.
“Today, Michigan State faces external pressures such as rising employee health care costs and increased operating costs due to inflation,” Guskiewicz said in the letter.
He also wrote the university is being affected by research state funding cuts and restrictions on international enrollments as part of general funding cuts from the federal government.
Guskiewicz added the future position layoffs come along with tuition increases which are part of the university’s “effort” to manage a 9% spending reduction of the general budget.
“As we’ve worked to reduce general fund spending by 9% over the next two years, I’ve appreciated the efforts of our colleges and units to prioritize non-personnel budget reductions,” Guskiewicz wrote.
  Michigan State University President Kevin Guskiewicz speaks at the Mackinac Policy Conference, May 30, 2024 | Anna Liz Nichols
It wasn’t specified in the letter which positions or how many workers will be directly affected.
He pointed that these budget and staff cuts should not impact important student services such as police, food service, and payroll. However, it was not specified the academic impact on MSU students.
‘Unfortunately, we will still have to eliminate some positions, the extent of which will vary by colleges and units. Although many units looked first to identify existing vacancies that could not be filled, there also will be some direct reductions in currently filled positions,” Guskiewicz wrote.
He also wrote that MSU will work with employee unions and offer benefits to those affected such as voluntary retirement incentive plans for some tenure track faculty and employee assistance program.
A request for comment on the specific impact on the MSU community was sent by the Advance to a university spokesperson, but has yet to be returned.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A proposed constitutional amendment aimed at protecting direct democracy in Arkansas was rejected a second time Tuesday by the state’s attorney general because it failed to comply with a new law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. 
Approved by state lawmakers in April, Act 602 prohibits the attorney general from certifying a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
According to Tuesday’s opinion, which was prepared by Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside and approved by Attorney General Tim Griffin, the latest ballot title proposed by the Protect AR Rights coalition ranks at a 9.3 reading level. While closer than the 11.5 level assigned to the original submission, Griffin said it still doesn’t meet the requirements of the law.
Arkansas group refiles direct democracy ballot measure after AG rejection

The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment would amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, the section that governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. It would designate the right of voters to make and repeal laws by petition as a “fundamental right.”
Among its various provisions, the measure would explicitly prohibit Arkansas lawmakers from amending or repealing a constitutional amendment approved by voters, require voters to be notified if their petition signature will be disqualified and given an opportunity to correct any problems, and require signatures to be gathered from at least 15 counties instead of 50.
A lawsuit challenging the 2023 law that increased the threshold from 15 to 50 counties is awaiting a judge’s decision following an October hearing. David Couch, a Little Rock attorney representing the plaintiffs, filed a letter Monday requesting that the case’s new judge issue an order or schedule another hearing soon.
Conflicting language regarding the measure’s provision on collecting signatures from 15 counties is another reason Griffin cited for Tuesday’s rejection. The attorney general said he suspects that sponsors intended the measure’s language to require signatures from at least 15 counties and to prevent any law that would require signatures to be gathered from more than 15 counties, but that’s not what was written.
“Rather, your proposed language requires that signatures be gathered from at least 15 counties, and it requires that the signatures be from no more than 15 counties,” Griffin wrote. “In other words, the signatures must come from exactly 15 counties.”
Griffin said this language is inconsistent with another provision in the proposal as well as the ballot title. Because this “key ambiguity” prevents the attorney general from ensuring the ballot title is not misleading or from substituting a more appropriate ballot title, Griffin said he could not certify the proposal.


Let us know what you think...


 

Gennie Diaz, a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition, said in a statement that the group “remains committed to safeguarding Arkansans’ rights to participate directly in the democratic process.” 
“We are reviewing the Attorney General’s feedback, and our drafting team will revise and resubmit the measure without delay,” Diaz said. “As we’ve previously stated, we believe the 8th grade readability requirement conflicts with our legal obligation to provide voters a clear and accurate ballot title — a concern we are addressing through ongoing litigation.”
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, another ballot question committee pursuing an education-focused constitutional amendment, are trying to challenge the eighth-grade reading law by intervening in a federal lawsuit that challenges several other new laws governing the state’s direct democracy process.
Court filings reveal opposition to intervening motion in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

Supporters of the new laws have said they will ensure the integrity of the initiative and referendum process, while opponents have argued the laws will make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. 
The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed the lawsuit against the secretary of state in April. The League proposed its own direct democracy-related ballot measure this year that was thrice rejected by the attorney general, including once for violating the new reading-level law. Griffin substituted and certified the popular name and ballot title so it met the eighth grade-reading level requirement in May. The League has begun gathering signatures to try to place its measure on the 2026 ballot.
In response to the motion, both the League and the state argued in court filings that Protect AR Rights lacks standing and is not entitled to intervene in the case. A judge has not yet ruled on the motion to intervene.

Over 800 people – including nearly 300 children – were slated to exit the program on Tuesday, as an executive order that extended their stays expired, according to data provided by the Department for Children and Families.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin and VTDigger reporter Greta Solsaa, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.

Chris Duprey was looking for a tent. One large enough to shelter his fiancée, his toddler and his 6-year-old kid.
It was time to check out of the Motel 6 in Colchester, where the family had lived for the better part of a year. They lost their manufactured home to the flood that swept through Plainfield last July, Duprey said. And now, the motel voucher that had allowed them to stay here was expiring.
“I’m hoping for a prayer right now,” said Duprey, 47, as he lingered in the motel parking lot on Tuesday morning. Packing up the room proved too painful. “We need a prayer.”
This latest round of evictions from the motel program has specifically targeted families with children and people with acute medical needs, like those who are homebound or receiving cancer treatment. It is the result of the expiration of an executive order that extended motel stays for those groups, deemed by Gov. Phil Scott’s administration as the most vulnerable to harm if they lost shelter.
Over 800 people – including nearly 300 children – were slated to exit the program on Tuesday, according to data provided by the Department for Children and Families. (An additional 138 people were scheduled to exit the program between June 23 and July 1 because their vouchers had timed out, according to the department.)

A back injury Duprey suffered after a fall while on a construction job had left him unable to work – and addicted to painkillers. He and his partner, Jessica Delary, 31, each had a criminal history stemming from a period when both struggled with substance use disorder, which proved a barrier to getting an apartment, he said. 
But for over a year, both Duprey and Delarey had been in recovery. They were focused on staying clean for the sake of their kids. Last month, their toddler had celebrated his first birthday at the motel where he’d spent most of his life, with a little party under the trees at the edge of the asphalt. They had recently landed a rental voucher, and were waiting to hear if a landlord they’d spoken to would accept it, but nothing was final.
By 11 a.m., the couple had decided to pay $80 out of pocket to stay at the motel one more night. They’d been calling around to service providers trying to find a tent, and hadn’t landed one yet. Purchasing one themselves would eat into the $900 a month they survive on from state welfare funds. And then there was the cost of paying for a campsite with water and electricity during the peak summer season.
“We can’t even afford a campground,” Duprey said.

State action 
The executive order, signed by Gov. Scott in late March, granted a three-month extension for families with children and people with acute medical needs who were sheltered in motels “to allow time for DCF to ensure” they have access to services and supports needed to transition to a long-term housing, shelter, or health care placement.
Without the order, those groups would have faced eviction when the motel program’s more flexible winter rules ended for the season in April. Democratic leaders in the Legislature had sought an extension for everyone sheltered through the program at that time, but Scott, a Republican, twice vetoed their effort – opting instead to protect a much narrower cohort his administration deemed most vulnerable. 
Yet homelessness advocates had not anticipated a mass exodus upon the executive order’s expiration. Because the order stated that existing time limits on motel stays “shall be waived” between April and June, they expected people would have more days left to use after the order lifted, forestalling the next wave of evictions until later this year.

But DCF sent out notices in early June specifying that nights sheltered under the order would in fact count towards each individual’s 80-day clock.
In recent days, service providers, Burlington city leaders and several lawmakers have issued letters to Scott imploring him to rescind those early-June notices, effectively giving motel residents more time in shelter. They have also called upon the governor to declare a state of emergency and direct officials to create shelters for people exiting the motels, among other demands.
So far, Scott has not taken action. A spokesperson for his office told VTDigger/Vermont Public in mid-June that he did not intend to extend the executive order.

Miranda Gray, deputy commissioner of DCF’s economic services division, said in an email that the department is encouraging people slated to lose their motel rooms to connect with local housing agencies. State employees and contracted case managers “have been working with the households housed under the [executive order] to identify plans for July 1st,” Gray said. 
DCF has not provided data on how many households it has helped ensure alternative accommodations for past June 30.
Last fall when Vermont saw a wave of families evicted from motels, the state opened a new family shelter at the Waterbury Armory. State officials shut it down on June 13. Asked if officials are considering reopening the shelter, Gray said that “all potential opportunities, including those involving existing facilities, are considered as part of this ongoing effort to expand safe and appropriate shelter capacity.”
Overnight parking and tents 
In at least one instance, a municipality is preparing to offer a sanctioned location for people to park their vehicles and sleep overnight.
On July 4, the city of Burlington will begin allowing up to twelve vehicles to park overnight at Perkins Pier, at the foot of Maple Street along the city’s waterfront. Individuals will need to get a permit from the city by noon on the 3rd in order to begin using the site the following day, said Sarah Russell, Burlington’s special assistant to end homelessness.

Those interested in using the site can reach out to Russell directly at 802-829-6326 or srussell@burlingtonvt.gov Monday-Friday. People will need to vacate the lot during the daytime. The city plans to install an ADA-accessible porta-potty onsite, but the site does not have access to electricity or running water. 
Russell called the sanctioned parking area a “pilot” project and a “harm reduction strategy.” Last fall, the city offered campsites at North Beach to families exiting motels, but now the popular campground is booked for the season, she said.
In Burlington and elsewhere, service providers are handing out tents to people in need.
At the Econo Lodge in Rutland Tuesday morning, Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont, offered supplies for people exiting the motel voucher program like tents, sleeping bags, blankets and tarps that the organization had purchased.

End Homelessness Vermont and other emergency providers have been “repetitively drained” after each motel exit, Siegel said. The need around the state far outweighs the resources the organization has available to give to the unhoused, she said.
“Their likelihood of survival is not high. I think they should at least have the right to get to and through a fair hearing to appeal this,” Siegel said. “Our system is failing, because it really means that it’s impossible for people to argue for their rights, and that’s not what should be happening right now. We should have a system that works.”
Casey Stevens, 38, of Rutland, said she had been staying at the Econo Lodge for six months after staying at hotels through the motel voucher program intermittently for a year and half. 
Stevens said she finds it unfair to be required to exit the hotel without sufficient time to figure out her plan. She did not know where she would be staying the night Tuesday, she said, but had reached out to BROC Community Action to inquire about shelter for the next few days. 
Stevens gained sobriety with the help of the organization Better Life Partners in Rutland and was in the process of interviewing for jobs, she said. She was planning to earn her bookkeeping certificate, but exiting the hotel may jeopardize her progress on those goals, she said. 
“Being able to be here has helped me become sober. I secured my plan. I actually signed up to go back to school this fall,” Stevens said. “I fear losing it all again.”

This story by Teresa McMinn was first published in the Cumberland Times-News on July 1.
CUMBERLAND, MD — Escorted by sheriff deputies, Jack LaSota used her restrained hands to carry a roughly two-foot stack of files and papers as she entered the courtroom. She sat at a table with her codefendants Michelle Zajko and Daniel Blank, and each of their attorneys.
LaSota, Zajko and Blank on Tuesday made initial appearances before Allegany County Circuit Court Judge Michael Twigg for a variety of recent charges, including misdemeanor gun and felony drug offenses, that stem from their February arrests on private property in Frostburg. Individually, each said they are not guilty of the crimes, but added they want to fight their legal battles as a team in a joint and jury trial.
“We’ve never had the opportunity for our clients to discuss these issues together,” Blank’s attorney Rebecca Lechliter said.
At her request, Twigg agreed to clear the courtroom for the defendants and their lawyers to strategize. Roughly 35 minutes later, the court reopened.
LaSota’s attorney, Elizabeth Lamm, requested the hearing be tabled until next week when her co-counsel David Schram, who was absent, is available and can provide input about individual versus joint trials. Twigg agreed and set 1:15 p.m. Tuesday for the continuation. Lechliter complained that the state has withheld information and evidence.
“I’m concerned about the way this case is dragging on,” she said and added it began with misdemeanor trespassing and has grown to include felony narcotics charges.
LaSota, Zajko and Blank are linked to a group known as the Zizians tied to violence in multiple states. Court records on Tuesday showed LaSota faces 12 charges, Zajko 17, and Blank 15, in Allegany County. Possible penalties for the various charges range from three months to 20 years of incarceration, plus fines.
The defendants need to decide how to pursue their cases “sooner rather than later,” Allegany County State’s Attorney James Elliott said and added a joint trial would last at least five days. He said his office is preparing documents to share with defense attorneys.
Zajko also faces a federal charge in Vermont for allegedly providing a gun used in a fatal shootout that left a U.S. border patrol agent dead earlier this year, according to VTDigger. Zajko has not appeared in court in Vermont to face that charge.
LaSota, who blogged under the name “Ziz,” was federally indicted last month in Maryland charged as an armed fugitive related to the Frostburg arrest.
On Tuesday, Zajko, whose brown curly hair marked time passed since a February mugshot depicted her crew cut, read from handwritten notes.
“I’m not a drug trafficker … never sold a drug in my life,” she said, raising her voice at times. “My friends and I are being held captive here,” Zajko said.
“What is happening in this courtroom won’t be forgotten,” she said. “This prosecution is malicious.”

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a pair of health care-related bills Tuesday that he said would put more controls on the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs sold through insurance plans while expanding insurance coverage for certain kinds of hospital costs.

“For too long our health care system has been infected by profit-seeking middlemen and predatory actors looking to make an extra dime at the expense of Illinois patients,” Pritzker said at a bill signing ceremony in Peoria. “Seniors have been forced to pay through the nose for life-saving medications. Families have had to delay or decline medically necessary treatments because they can’t afford it anymore. And family businesses like independent pharmacies have had to shut their doors.”

House Bill 1697, known as the Prescription Drug Affordability Act, will impose new restrictions on practices of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, a powerful but little-understood segment of the pharmaceutical industry.

PBMs are companies that act as a kind of middleman between health insurance plans and pharmaceutical companies by negotiating drug prices and designing drug formularies that are intended to steer patients toward lower-cost medications.

But they have come under intense criticism in recent years for steering patients toward their own affiliated retail chain pharmacies, often to the detriment of smaller independent pharmacies, and for operating pricing systems that are designed to maximize profits for the PBMs rather than producing savings for patients.

Under the legislation, PBMs will be prohibited from steering consumers toward large pharmacies in which they have a financial interest. They will also be prohibited from engaging in “spread pricing” – the practice of charging health plans a higher price for a drug than the PBM pays a pharmacy for dispensing the drug.

The bill also establishes a grant program that will distribute $25 million a year in financial support for independent pharmacies, funded through a tax levied on PBMs operating in Illinois.

David Bagot, an independent pharmacist from Petersburg who is also president of the Illinois Pharmacists Association, called the bill “landmark legislation” that he predicted would be studied and replicated in other states.

“This bill represents the most comprehensive reform of pharmacy benefit managers we have seen in Illinois,” he said. “For far too long, these companies have used our nation’s drug supply chain to benefit shareholders and executives while driving up costs for people who rely on medications and driving pharmacies out of business.”

But the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the lobbying organization that represents PBMs, called the bill “misguided legislation” and predicted it would have little or no impact on the prices consumers pay for medications.

“Unfortunately, the legislation does nothing to address the fact that Big Pharma sets the price of the prescription drugs – and the price is the problem when it comes to some Illinoisans facing difficulty affording their prescription drugs,” the group said in a statement. “Lawmakers have passed 20 bills regulating and restricting PBMs since 2016, none of which have led to lower drug prices.”

Insurance coverage expansion

Pritzker also signed House Bill 3019, known as the Healthcare Protection Expansion Act.

Among other things, it prohibits state-regulated health plans from requiring prior authorization for outpatient mental health services. Last year, lawmakers imposed a similar prohibition for inpatient and emergency mental health services.

It also requires insurance plans to cover a patient’s travel-related expenses whenever they have to travel long distances to receive in-network care, a problem often faced by patients who live in rural areas of the state.

“Building on protections that make mental health care accessible for all Illinois residents, this law gives people more opportunities and flexibility to receive necessary services,” state Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, a lead sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.

Republican Lance Russell announced his candidacy Tuesday for the seat current Attorney General Marty Jackley will leave behind to run for U.S. House of Representatives in 2026. South Dakota’s current U.S. representative, Dusty Johnson, announced a long-rumored 2026 bid for governor on Monday.
Russell, 55, lives in Hot Springs and serves as the state’s attorney for Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties. 
“I am running to work as our next attorney general to ensure safer communities and open government for all South Dakotans,” Russell said in a press release. 
Republicans choose their attorney general candidate by a vote of state convention delegates. Russell sought the nomination in 2018 but fell to Jason Ravnsborg in a second ballot, 37% to 63%. 
Ravnsborg won the general election. His term was cut short by a legislative impeachment and removal after he struck and killed a man with his vehicle. Then-Gov. Kristi Noem appointed former Pennington County State’s Attorney Mark Vargo to serve the remainder of Ravnsborg’s term, and Jackley ran uncontested in the 2022 general election to return to the post he’d previously held. 
Russell holds a law degree from the University of South Dakota and a master of laws degree in natural resources and environmental law from the University of Denver. In addition to his work as a state’s attorney, he has a private practice and serves as a city attorney for several communities in the southern Black Hills.

,DC,2025-07-01 22:34:04+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Republicans rewrote the US Senate megabill in its last moments,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-rewrote-us-senate-megabill-its-last-moments,,"WASHINGTON — The final “big beautiful bill” approved by Senate Republicans Tuesday included some last-minute changes on hot-button issues such as safety net programs and clean energy tax credits.Senate Republicans had wrangled for weeks to deliver legislative text to satisfy concerns from lawmakers who objected to cutting Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income families and some individuals with disabilities.Other sticking points included threats that the health cuts pose to rural hospitals, and tax revisions that hamper clean energy jobs and investment, most of which are in states that elected President Donald Trump to his second term.The lawmakers debated amendments for more than 24 hours. Even with final changes, now under consideration in the House, three Republicans held out: Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie breaking vote.Here are several rewrites that popped up in the bill’s final minutes and hours:Rural hospital fundSenate Republicans doubled the amount for a rural health “transformation program,” or money to compensate rural hospitals for the funds they would lose as a result of the proposed Medicaid cuts.The latest proposal sets aside $50 billion, up from $25 billion, and moves up the distribution timeline to begin in 2026, up from 2028.Collins had unsuccessfully introduced an amendment to bump the fund to $50 billion. Despite some support from GOP colleagues, the amendment was blunted by a technical budget point of order.The Maine Republican still voted “no” Tuesday on the final bill.SNAPThe lawmakers also made a late change to how and when states would begin to shoulder the responsibility for costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.According to the new version, if a state’s payment error rate in 2025 multiplied by 1.5 is equal or greater than 20%, then that state would be permitted to wait until 2029, rather than 2028, to begin footing a portion of the bill for food assistance.  A state’s accuracy rate is the annual measurement of over- or underpayments to recipients.Nine states would hover in the territory of meeting that threshold, according to the Department of Agriculture’s latest error rates published Monday. They are: Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Oregon.Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states in both 2023 and 2024. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s final decision on the bill was largely unknown until she cast a “yes” vote Tuesday.A late amendment to strike the language offered by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota failed 45-55.Critics say the measure incentivizes states to keep the payment error rates high this year.Solar energyGOP senators late Friday added a clean energy excise tax into the bill, taking the industry by surprise. Then it vanished.The tax that would have been imposed on new solar and wind projects was no longer in the legislation that senators voted on around noon Eastern Tuesday.Other text loosened a squeeze on tech-neutral tax credits meant to incentivize the installation of energy systems that do not use fossil fuels. Senate Republicans added a year of leeway for new projects to break ground and avoid cutting short two of the tax credits.",,,,2025-07-01 19:05:00.477586

Rihanna Kelver used the women’s restroom at the Wyoming Capitol building Tuesday in defiance of a new law prohibiting transgender people’s use of public facilities. 
The post Transgender woman protests new law with visit to a Wyoming Capitol bathroom appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Standing outside a women’s restroom in the Wyoming State Capitol, Rihanna Kelver gazed downward, clasped her hands and took a deep breath. 
Like countless times before, Kelver, 27, was about to use a public restroom. But today was different. A new law had just gone into effect. 
Starting Tuesday in Wyoming, “in each public facility, no person shall enter a changing area, restroom or sleeping quarters that is designated for males or females unless the person is a member of that sex,” according to the statute.
In other words, the new law requires people to use the facility that corresponds to the sex they were assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, physical appearance or what appears on their legal documents. While it does not impose criminal or civil liability on anyone who violates the law, it leaves governmental bodies on the hook if they fail to enforce the restriction. 
Kelver, a transgender woman, had driven from her home in Laramie, accompanied by a small group of friends and supporters, to test the bounds of the new law. 
“That’s the thing. We’re showing up to the state and asking them to put their money where their mouth is,” Kelver told WyoFile outside the capitol building. 
In the days and weeks leading up to this moment, Kelver had felt anxious, she said. 
She’d made public statements before. In high school, she came out to her peers in her campaign speech for student body president. And when she was 18, Kelver ran for Albany County School Board as an openly transgender candidate. 
“This one, the ‘what ifs’ are a lot more diverse,” Kelver said. “They’re a lot more unknown. And there’s more severity to some of those ‘what ifs’ for today.”
And yet, Kelver said she felt compelled to go through with it. 
“I want to be here today because I know the fear and anxiety I felt with these laws and within the national conversation,” Kelver told WyoFile outside the Capitol. “I want to be here so [others] know they don’t have to feel alone, and that’s the biggest message.”
Ahead of her demonstration, Kelver gave the Wyoming Highway Patrol and governor’s office a heads up about her plans to use a women’s bathroom in the capitol. 
In case she got arrested, Kelver gave her keys, wallet and phone to her fiancé before walking into the building. She tucked her ID card into the front pocket of her black jeans. 
“I do not inherently believe in the state’s interpretation of my own identity, nor will I willfully be silent in the enforcement of where and how I can exist in public as who I am. I mean no one else harm,” Kelver said in a short speech before ascending the capitol steps.

“Today, I am about to enter [the Capitol] with a couple of my friends, to use the women’s restroom in accordance with my gender identity and legal identity,” she said. “I don’t know what’s about to happen, but I’m ready for whatever happens.”
Outside the bathroom doors, a friend, who’d been recording Kelver on a phone, stopped while Nichol Bondurant, Kelver’s former English teacher, walked in ahead of Kelver to make sure it was empty. (Kelver later said she “didn’t want to throw anybody in the middle” of her decision.)
When it was all clear, Kelver walked in, used the facility, washed her hands and exited. That was it. 
“Have a good day,” Kelver, in passing, told the highway patrolmen at a nearby desk. 
“Same to you,” he responded. 
How we got here
Wyoming’s new bathroom restrictions were just one of a slate of measures lawmakers passed in the 2025 session to restrict the rights of transgender people. 
A second bathroom-related bill puts the onus on public school students to use restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping quarters that align with their sex at birth. And an extension of the 2023 sports ban now applies to collegiate athletics in Wyoming. 
While LGBTQ+ advocates hope to use the legal system to defeat the new laws, no such legal challenge has yet to be filed. 
Meanwhile, the legislation’s sponsors have said the new laws are not about restricting rights, but safety and privacy. 
As Tuesday’s demonstration unfolded uneventfully, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus took to social media. The group, which represents the Legislature’s further-right flank, has been outspoken in its opposition to transgender rights.
“We call on Governor Gordon to utilize the good men and women of the Wyoming Highway Patrol on site at the People’s House to defend House Bill 72, now House Enrolled Act 48,” the caucus posted on X. 
The governor’s office declined to comment to WyoFile. 
Jessie Rubino, the Wyoming state director for the State Freedom Caucus Network, was at the Capitol to watch the demonstration, but declined to comment. 
In April, a transgender woman was arrested in Florida after washing her hands in a bathroom at that state capitol. The woman was protesting a law that criminalizes using restrooms in public buildings that don’t match one’s sex at birth. The case was dropped this week. 
Decision
Outside the capitol building, Kelver returned to the rest of her supporters, standing in the shade of a cottonwood tree, who cheered her return. 
“As some of you know, I ran away from Laramie and Wyoming for a little bit because I got scared,” Kelver said, referring to a recent year-long spell in Colorado. 
“But I made my decision. I’m back. I’m gonna be loud. I’m gonna be obnoxious for the state, not out of volition, but just because of who I am. 
“So I love you all,” she concluded. “Thank you for coming.”

In a lawsuit filed in Cole County Circuit Court Monday, MNEA argues that state funds cannot be directly given to MOScholars under the current statute.
MNEA vice president Rebeka McIntosh and member Kimberly Duvall, who serves as president of the Blue Springs chapter of the National Education Association, are suing on behalf of the organization’s 30,000 members.
“The General Assembly has far overstepped its authority and violated five provisions of the Missouri Constitution by using an appropriations bill to construct out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues to what are essentially vouchers for the payment of private school tuition for elementary and secondary school students,” MNEA’s attorney Loretta Haggard wrote.
MOScholars currently operates using nonprofits dubbed “educational assistance organizations” to gather donations and distribute scholarships to students in private, parochial or home schools. Donors can receive a tax credit equal to 100% of their contribution but can use it to cover no more than half of their state tax liability. 
State law allows 4% of donations to be reserved to cover the costs of administering the program, including marketing.
But the budget passed by the lawmakers  “dramatically changes the landscape,” Haggard contends.
The budget signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe Monday includes an injection of general revenue to the MOScholars program, budgeting $50 million for scholarships and $1 million to assist marketing the program.
This, MNEA argues, breaks state law for multiple reasons.
The 2021 law that created MOScholars prescribes the use of tax-deductible donations to educational assistance organizations (EAOs), not general revenue, as a funding source.
“The money for (MOScholars) scholarships comes from donations that taxpayers make to EAOs, and EAOs then remit to families. The donated funds never come into the custody of the state, and the state does not select scholarship recipients,” Haggard wrote.
The direct appropriation to the program effectively amends the MOScholars statute, the lawsuit says, which violates laws requiring legislative authorization and limits bills to a single subject. Changing statute in a budget bill is not allowed.
  State Treasurer Vivek Malek speaks during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol Wednesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The money would have to flow through a fund overseen by the State Treasurer’s Office which currently does not hold scholarship money. The fund is “to be used by the state treasurer for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the program, whichever is less,” according to state law.
Using the fund to administer scholarships is “unauthorized,” the lawsuit says.
MNEA is asking for a preliminary injunction, which would block the $51 million appropriation from being transferred to the MOScholars fund while litigation ensues.
“Once the unlawful appropriations are disbursed to private entities or individuals, it will be difficult if not impossible to claw those funds back to the treasury where they belong,” the lawsuit says.
MNEA argues that the money, if given to MOScholars, would hurt public education statewide.
“Politicians in Jefferson City and their privatization lobbyists are stealing from our kids,” said Missouri NEA President Phil Murray. “In rural Missouri, that $51 million means losing our music teacher, canceling basketball, and watching our schools crumble. They’re killing our small towns.”
Missouri Treasurer Vivek Malek, in an interview with The Independent in May, addressed the possibility of a lawsuit.
“We will deal with it when that happens,” he said. “I cannot predict which course it will take.”

Colorado Democrats blasted the measure, highlighting potential harms it could cause to the state budget and programs. Republicans largely applauded tax provisions in the bill.
The bill, which passed the Senate in a 51-50 vote, would extend tax breaks that were passed by Republicans in 2017, make cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and significantly increase border security and defense spending, among many other provisions.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a calculation Sunday showing the bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.
Colorado’s U.S. senators, Democrats Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, voted against the bill.
Reps prepare to vote
Members of the state’s U.S. House delegation — four Democrats and four Republicans — are expected to vote on the Senate version of the GOP bill in the coming days, with the House reconvening Wednesday. The House passed the initial version of the bill in May, but now it must approve changes made by the Senate. Colorado’s House delegation voted along party lines in May, with Republicans in favor of the measure.
Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, praised a provision in the Senate bill to eliminate taxes on qualifying tips until 2028. 
“I believe that if you earn it, you should keep it,” Evans said in a social media post. “That’s why I voted for No Tax on Tips. It’s the perfect recipe to put more money back in the pockets of #CO08 workers and invest in Main Street.”
In another post, he wrote, “Without the One Big Beautiful Bill, Colorado families will have to pay thousands more in taxes. That’s why I voted for the OBBB. Less money in taxes means more money in Coloradans’ pockets.”
Evans represents Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, one of only a handful of House swing districts in the country. He has faced fierce criticism over his support of the megabill, particularly due to the cuts it would make to Medicaid.
Colorado Democrats are sounding off about how the bill’s cuts to health and food safety net programs and other measures could put Colorado in a billion-dollar budget crunch. Based on the House version of the bill, estimates say that at least 100,000 Coloradans could lose Medicaid coverage.
Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, plans to vote against the bill, calling it a “cruel piece of legislation.”
“This bill gives tax breaks to billionaires while gutting Medicaid, slashing SNAP benefits, defunding Planned Parenthood and undermining our clean energy future,” DeGette said in a statement. “I won’t support it.”
Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Centennial said in a statement that the bill is “one of the worst” he has ever seen.
“I cannot support this Republican bill that takes health care and food assistance from working people to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans,” Crow said. “This bill is bad for Colorado and America.”
The offices of Colorado’s other representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.
Polis slams Senate bill
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, urged the House to scrap the Senate’s version of the bill and start over, calling for an “end to the madness.”
“Today, Republicans in the Senate voted to kick Americans off health care, raise costs on insurance, kill jobs, increase our deficit and debt, and make it harder for kids to access food,” Polis said in a statement. “This shameful vote comes at the expense of hardworking Coloradans. This bill is bad for our communities, bad for our economy, and will increase the deficit and balloon our national debt. It’s time for the House to rise to the occasion and do their part to protect Americans from this bill and start over.”
Colorado’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting estimates that the bill would decrease the state’s revenue by $500 million and increase the state’s expenses by up to $650 million.

Wyoming Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso voted yes on the bill, which narrowly cleared the U.S. Senate Tuesday.
The post Medicaid, insurance cuts in ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ will harm Wyoming, health care advocates warn appeared first on WyoFile .","At least 12,000 Wyoming residents are projected to lose health coverage if President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” is signed into law, health care advocates say. 
The voluminous bill inched closer to passage Tuesday when it cleared the Senate by a single vote cast by Vice President J.D. Vance. Wyoming’s two Republican senators, Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso, both voted yes. 
“While this bill certainly isn’t perfect, it’s a major step in the right direction that further unlocks Wyoming energy and delivers significant wins for working families across Wyoming,” Lummis said in a statement. She released a tally of industries and areas that stand to benefit from the bill, which included coal, livestock and rural economic development. 
Meantime, opponents are ringing the alarm bells on legislation they say will have devastating health care impacts on the nation’s low-income residents. In Wyoming, they say, that will mean more uninsured patients, climbing health care costs and mounting pressure on already-strained rural hospitals. 
“The cuts to Medicaid and the [Affordable Care Act] will have devastating and dramatic impacts on health coverage, care, and costs for American families, and in many ways, especially in Wyoming,” Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, said in a statement. “The cuts will not just mean that tens of thousands of Wyoming residents lose coverage, but federal cuts will force state budgets into crisis, forcing states to drastically scale back services, leading to closures of rural hospitals and community clinics.” 
​​The president’s enormous tax and spending bill has implications for an array of policies. Along with slashing Medicaid spending, it sets aside money for immigration enforcement, including mass deportations, extends tax cuts and axes spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps low-income people pay for food. 
Coverage
The bill is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Changes include increased work requirements and potential penalties for states that have expanded Medicaid. 
Wyoming is one of the few states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid and so would avoid some immediate hits, said Josh Hannes, vice president of the Wyoming Hospitals Association. However, impacts are still expected here, he said.

“Some of the concerns for us are around reducing the proactive look-back period of Medicaid from 90 to 30 days,” he said. That change would cut two months off the current provision that allows Medicaid patients to get coverage for health care costs incurred during the three months prior to their enrollment. 
The Wyoming Medicaid program covers 62,000 patients, according to Families USA. Some 46,000 residents, meanwhile, get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage, which is available for people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer.
Another big worry, Hannes said, is related to enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace. Those are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the bill does not renew them. 
Since 2021, when those credits were enacted, Hannes said, “we more than doubled our enrollment on the marketplace … because it provided greater subsidies to more people.” 
Without those subsidies, he said, thousands of people are expected to lose their ability to afford insurance premiums. “It’s a big concern,” he said. “We already have one of the higher uninsured rates in the country, and this will make it worse.”
Nate Martin, executive director of Better Wyoming, honed in on the tax-credit related costs in a recent opinion piece for WyoFile. “Currently, a single person earning $62,000 a year in Wyoming can buy a year’s worth of medical insurance for $5,270 thanks to Marketplace tax credits,” he wrote. “If the Big Beautiful Bill eliminates those credits, that price will increase to $11,810, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.”
The hike would be even more dramatic for older Wyoming residents who aren’t quite eligible for Medicare, Martin wrote. “Right now, a 60-year-old couple earning $80,000 a year together can buy health insurance from the Marketplace for $6,970 to cover both of them. Again, this is thanks to tax credits. Under the Big Beautiful Bill, the cost will shoot up to $44,392 a year just for insurance premiums.”
Hospital, clinic strain 
The bill poses significant damage to rural health care in particular, four Democratic senators stressed in a June 12 letter to Trump. A majority of adults living in rural areas are concerned about the cuts, according to the letter. 
“They are right to be worried, as these cuts will have devastating consequences for health outcomes and costs, jobs, and the economic success of rural communities,” the letter stated. 
Too many rural hospitals are already operating on the brink, they said, pointing to data from the Sheps Center that identifies more than 300 at-risk hospitals across the country that the senators assert would be further endangered by the cuts. 
Wyoming hospitals are all vulnerable, Hannes has said, due to the challenges of operating rural health care. Low patient volumes, administrative burdens from insurance companies, high rates of uninsured patients, rising labor costs and increasing prescription drug prices create a difficult landscape for financial sustainability, he said. In addition, Wyoming’s 15 hospital districts are facing steep property tax revenue cuts thanks to a new state law.

Facilities like the Downtown Clinic in Laramie would also certainly see impacts, according to a recent op-ed by its director, Pete Gosar. The clinic serves low-income, uninsured patients, including those without Medicare, Medicaid or VA benefits. 
“We are proud to do this vital work, and 90% of our funding is derived from privately raised dollars,” Gosar wrote. “But how, I ask, do you expect an additional 12 to 16 million people to enter this system without a shred of additional financial support? This puts clinics like ours in an utterly precarious situation.”
Gosar called the damage to rural health care “catastrophic.” 
“If Congress truly wished to support rural healthcare, they would ensure people have access to healthcare in the first place, rather than offering inadequate props after inflicting such profound damage,” he wrote. 
Presidential promises
Barrasso, who is Senate Majority Whip and a physician by training, has repeatedly celebrated the bill as a win. It translates into tax cuts and less government spending, he posted on the social media platform X, which means more money in the pockets of Americans.
In a Monday interview on Fox News, Barrasso addressed Medicaid when he said millions of undocumented Americans are on the federal program. 
“We need to stop that,” he said. “Taxpayer dollars should not be going for Medicaid for illegal immigrants.”
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or other federally funded coverage, as reported by KFF Health News.

Following Tuesday’s Senate vote, Barrasso posted another triumphant message. 
“Americans elected Republicans to make our country safer, stronger, and more prosperous,” he wrote. “This bill does it.”
Critics, however, believe it will do the opposite. The organization Healthy Wyoming has been focused on expanding Medicaid in recent years. In a May webinar, the group’s interim executive director, Jenn Lowe, emphasized the harm the bill posed to Wyoming’s precarious health care network and its largely aging patients. 
“Any cuts to Medicaid, regardless of how they are sold or justified, will result in long-term harm to children and families and will put at risk many healthcare clinics that we all rely on as we travel across this great state,” she said. 
The act now returns to the House of Representatives, which passed its own version in May. 
Trump has set a Friday deadline for the legislation to be on his desk.

“Every contribution made through these official channels goes directly toward supporting the families in their time of unimaginable loss and need,” the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release. 
The brush fire officials believe the suspect caused, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 38 acres by Tuesday morning, largely because of better mapping, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The fire is not contained. 
The U.S. Forest Service on Tuesday closed roads near Canfield Mountain until July 15, unless the order ends earlier. A temporary flight restriction is still in effect for the area. Flying drones or aircraft in the area without authorization poses “a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities,” Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Structures are still not at risk from the fire, and no evacuations have been ordered, Department of Lands officials say. The fire is in steep terrain.
Crews on Tuesday will work to contain the fire by installing hose lays and setting up water access for the fire’s perimeter, officials say. Fire operations on Tuesday also changed from the Idaho Department of Lands’ Mica Fire Protection District to the North Idaho Type 3 Incident Management Team.
The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts. The fire’s cause remains under investigation.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The plot thickened as billionaire Elon Musk waded into the feud between President Donald Trump and defiant Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie.
Musk promised Monday evening to help Massie fend off any Republican primary challenger recruited by Trump who is vowing to unseat Massie next year.
Massie most recently drew Trump’s wrath by opposing his bombing of Iran and before that voting against the mega-bill that supporters say delivers on the president’s campaign promises, though clashes between Masie and Trump date back to Trump’s first term.
And Massie is not the only Kentucky Republican who has defied Trump and party leaders by voting against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Even after a round of golf with the president on Saturday, Sen. Rand Paul voted against starting debate on the bill and on Tuesday against the bill itself, which required a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance to squeak out of the Republican-controlled Senate.
In a Republican Party that has fallen in lockstep behind Trump and a state that Trump has easily carried three times, Paul and Massie may face risks getting on the wrong side of Trump and his MAGA base. 
Political observers in Kentucky say the two can get away with it because they are coming from Trump’s right on questions of government spending and fiscal responsibility and because they are viewed as acting on principle.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)
Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky, said Paul, Massie and Musk “have been motivated by a right-leaning libertarianism that shows up in their politics regularly.”
“It’s a matter of principle that separates them from other Republicans and having Republican President Donald Trump dive so thoroughly into a big government, strong presidency, model of leadership cuts against the principles of all three of those men.”
Massie, an MIT-educated engineer who served as Lewis County judge-executive, was elected to Congress in 2012. His 4th Congressional District stretches from Ashland in the Appalachian hills westward along the Ohio River to the conservative suburbs of Northern Kentucky and Louisville. 
Trump’s political operation has $500 million ready to bolster — or punish — Republicans heading into midterm elections. Trump-affiliated PAC, MAGA Kentucky, launched a $1 million ad buy against Massie last week, Axios reports, Ahead of the ad buy, Trump took to Truth Social to say Massie “is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is” and vowed to campaign in Kentucky for “a wonderful American Patriot” candidate against the congressman. 
Trump’s candidate has yet to emerge, but first-term Republican state Sen. Aaron Reed of Shelby County has been mentioned as a possibility in some political circles.
On Monday, Musk, who has been publicly feuding with the president over the GOP domestic policy bill, waded into the fray, saying on his social media platform X that he would support Massie. Moments before Musk had vowed that Republicans “who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history” would “lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”

The congressman welcomed Musk’s support by sharing a Fox News article about the post Tuesday morning, to which Musk replied, “You’re awesome.” 
Voss said it may become “a Trump versus Musk proxy war in Northern Kentucky,” though both men have a tendency to “jump from controversy to controversy.” 
If attention on the primary blows over by next year, Massie could have an easier time keeping his job, Voss said, but “he may have other ambitions than merely keeping his job.” 
“Thomas Massie has become a household name in a way few members of the House of Representatives get to be,” Voss said. “The fame and notoriety he’s getting might put his current seat in greater jeopardy, but it opens up lots of opportunities.” 
For Republicans hoping to position themselves as the future of their party, particularly if Trump’s popularity with voters dwindles and the GOP takes losses in midterm elections, “being on the side of the GOP that resisted Trump can start to pay off.” 
“Right now, going against Trump is the kiss of death, but that may change,” Voss said. 
At least one Republican in Congress, North Carolina Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, said he won’t seek reelection after voting against Trump’s bill. Tillis’ opposition stemmed from the bill’s funding cuts which he said would force “painful decisions” about Medicaid and hurt his state.
In contrast, Massie and Paul objected to the bill because it will send federal deficits soaring. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a calculation Sunday showing the Senate version of the bill would add $3.25 trillion to federal budget deficits over 10 years.
Tres Watson, a political consultant and former spokesperson for the Republican Party of Kentucky, said Massie’s 2026 primary is “definitely going to be a fight” especially with Musk’s interest in the race. Watson added that the endorsements of Trump and Musk might have less impact on the contest than the resources each could put behind a candidate.
Watson said Massie has a strong set of beliefs and he will vote for them “whether that puts him in very awkward positions with very awkward bedfellows or not.” As a fiscally conservative, libertarian Republican, “he’s going to be against this bill.” 
Paul is similar to Massie but “occasionally will play ball a little bit more,” Watson said. Paul and Trump likely developed rapport during the 2016 campaign, “whereas Massie has kind of always been a thorn in Trump’s side dating back to the first administration.”
Paul hasn’t faced Trump’s wrath like Massie has. 
Musk’s involvement could also mean the primary will be quite expensive. Groups affiliated with Musk spent nearly $20 million backing a conservative candidate in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election earlier this year, according to media reports. Musk also gave the state Republican Party $2 million. Despite all that, Musk’s candidate lost.
Massie thanked Musk Tuesday from his campaign account on X, adding Musk’s purchase of X, formerly Twitter, and making it the “platform for free speech has already helped my cause immensely,” allowing the congressman to “bypass conventional media to refute the lies of both political parties and to provide transparency about how Congress works and what’s actually inside of the bills we vote on.”
Massie said opposing the megabill and the Iran strikes “recently earned me the ire of the swamp and a fight for my re-election,” but the race is instead “a referendum on whether members of Congress can think and act independently based on what’s best for the country, or whether all members of congress must be reduced to rubber stamps for their respective political parties and swampy special interests.” 
“I’m extremely thankful to have Elon Musk’s financial assistance to continue my mission as an independent voice in Congress for my constituents,” Massie wrote.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2204622175-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

(Photo by Justin Garcia / Las Cruces Bulletin)The New Mexico Department of Justice announced on Tuesday it has joined 15 other states in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education’s discontinuation in April of grants under the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The law, which U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) played a role in crafting, included enhanced measures to address gun violence, including more funding for school-based mental health programs.
Specifically, a news release from New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s office notes, the bill allocated $1 billion to expand access to school-based mental health services. However, the federal education department in April “issued boilerplate notices discontinuing the grants based on vague and unsupported claims of conflict with current policy priorities,” the news release said. “The coalition lawsuit argues this violates federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act and statutory protections under the Safer Communities Act” and has asked the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington to block the cuts.
“It is one of our greatest responsibilities to protect the mental health and safety of our children,” Torrez said in a a statement. “This funding was secured by Congress—thanks in large part to the leadership of Senator Heinrich—to address the trauma and mental health challenges students face after school shootings and during an ongoing youth mental health crisis. The Department’s decision to abruptly eliminate this funding is not only reckless, but it also defies the law and threatens to dismantle programs that are saving lives.”
The state in April also joined in a lawsuit against the federal education department’s cancellation of funds for three programs funded through the American Rescue Act to help vulnerable school children recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The new suit comes as the Trump administration puts on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools, according to an Education Department notice obtained by States Newsroom.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) During Tuesday’s first meeting of the Iowa State University presidential search committee, members of the ISU community, alongside state officials and search consultants, began crafting a list of qualities of a future university president.
The committee includes faculty and staff representatives, students and alumni from ISU, as well as Iowa Board of Regents members. They are working with board staff and presidential search firm AGB Search to first identify the type of candidates they want the position to attract, review candidates and select those that would serve best in the role that will be left vacant by Wendy Wintersteen in January 2026.
“The hiring of a university president is the most important thing the board does, and your work will be critical in identifying the best possible finalists for the board to consider,” Board President Sherry Bates told committee members during the meeting. “Your efforts will be rewarded when we hire the next great leader for Iowa State.”

AGB Search Managing Principal Rodrick McDavis, who previously spoke with the regents on best practices for a collegiate presidential search, provided the committee with a tentative, “very, very, very tight” timeline that would have the search wrapped up by the board’s November meeting.
With the first presidential search committee completed, McDavis said the next step is to conduct listening sessions with campus stakeholders throughout mid-July ahead of the July 23 official search launch. At that point, the position will be posted online and advertised, and search consultants will begin recruiting candidates.
The “best consideration” deadline for applications is set for Sept. 19, three days after which the search committee will gain access to documents to start reviewing candidates, McDavis said. The committee will meet the week of Oct. 6 to choose semifinalists from the pool of candidates and develop interview questions that they will have the opportunity to ask during interviews Oct. 20.
From those interviews, finalists will be selected and their names will be released one-by-one 24 hours ahead of their campus visits, scheduled for the week of Nov. 3.
“The goal of our process is that the board of regents will be in a position to make its selection of a president-elect at the board meetings that will occur on November the 11th through the 13th,” McDavis said.
The group recorded a long list of qualities, skills and experiences they’d like to see in candidates, including political savvy, an entrepreneurial spirit, relatability and the capacity to make difficult decisions.
ISU Professional and Scientific Council President-Elect Jennifer Schroeder said candidates need to be able to communicate and collaborate both internally, across ISU’s colleges and departments, and externally on all levels.
“They need to go from speaking to a student in poverty, coming in first-gen, all the way up to a multi-millionaire businessman in the industry and everything in between, and being able to adjust their approach so that they are relatable they feel genuine to the person they’re speaking with,” Schroeder said.
All of the chosen qualifiers will be used to create a leadership profile, McDavis said, that once reviewed by the committee and board of regents, will be sent across the country for potential applicants.
During the meeting, committee members expressed the need for the future ISU president to have at least an appreciation and understanding of — if not actual experience in — higher education and all that comes with it: research, shared governance, building community and business relationships, and the wants and needs of students, staff and faculty.
ISU’s unique attributes as a land grant university with the Ames National Laboratory and the ISU Research Park should be emphasized as critical aspects of the university’s identity and operations, members said, and should also be recognized by candidates.
Janice Fitzgerald, a senior executive search consultant with ABG Search, said it is these qualities that will intrigue potential candidates, with Rod adding that there are people across the U.S. who are waiting for a position like this to open up for them.
“Iowa State has unique characteristics, and it’s going to be very attractive to individuals,” Fitzgerald said. “Every university or college has a personality, and Iowa State has always been upscale and welcoming, so that is also going to be very attractive to candidates and advocates.”
Suggestions by the search consultants for criteria to think about in a candidate included their level of degree and their plans for and experience with both enrollment and crisis management. McDavis said good candidates should also be able to both visualize and implement a strategic plan.
The group also brainstormed challenges ISU and higher education are facing, including the enrollment cliff, lost or uncertain federal funding and more.
Roger Underwood, an ISU alum on the committee, said the problems faced by ISU right now like research funding being cut are “nickels and dimes” compared to what’s coming — U.S. Social Security “going upside down” after 2032 and states having to absorb more costs relating to Medicare and Medicaid. He said the state, which only funds around one-third of university budgets through appropriations, could pull back funding even more.
“I think it’s going to be a rare bird out there, that we’re going to find that person that can balance the three-to-five year plan but can also look out well beyond that and then sell that back to all the groups represented here, which are going to be dramatic, dramatic changes, not incremental,” Underwood said.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)While dozens of New Mexico acequias continue reckoning with  damage from natural disasters over the last three years, they are making progress, according to officials helping them navigate multiple layers of bureaucracy.
Disasters like the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire near Las Vegas in 2022, along with the South Fork and Salt fires in Ruidoso and the Rio Chama Flooding in Rio Arriba County last year, resulted in damage to 150 acequias, according to Paula Garcia, executive director of the New Mexico Acequia Association. That amounts to about one-sixth of the state’s roughly 900 acequias. 
Garcia gave a presentation to members of the Legislature’s interim Water and Natural Resources Committee, which is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in Las Vegas, a town of about 12,000 that continues to grapple with the aftermath of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, particularly when it comes to post-fire flooding and potential drinking water contamination. 
The presentation occurs as President Donald Trump’s administration mulls deep cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the potential end of disaster declarations that keep certain emergency funding streams flowing to individuals and public entities. 
After fire and flood, ash chokes acequias in northern NM

It also comes after dozens of people were fired locally from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a federal agency that funds emergency watershed repair and other programs acequias rely on. 
Last week, Western governors agreed to explore formalizing inter-state partnerships to address the  aftermath of post-fire flooding, a concern they dedicated an entire panel to during the annual Western Governors’ Association conference in Santa Fe. 
Agriculture that relies on acequias in and around the burn scar remains largely halted more than three years after the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, Garcia said, and every rainstorm brings the threat that acequias will flood or fill with silt that flows off fire-scarred mountainsides.
But she said her nonprofit organization and state government agencies are making progress when it comes to finally untangling a complicated federal bureaucracy that was initially unfamiliar with acequias and is still inflexible when it comes to ongoing flooding. 
Amid FEMA uncertainty, Western governors commit to more coordination on post-fire flooding

“I would like for FEMA to clean up the bureaucracy and red tape, but we’re managing it now,” Garcia said. 
One major hurdle acequias faced concerned upfront costs they must produce before work can be completed, Garcia said. Even though state or federal agencies reimburse most or all costs,  even modest upfront costs are often insurmountable for the small, volunteer-led irrigation canals. 
As such, more than 100 acequias statewide have sought help from the NRCS’ Emergency Watershed Protection Program, Garcia said, largely because that program allows acequias to offload the paperwork to a local sponsor like a county or a local soil and water conservation district. 
Thanks to a partnership between FEMA and state agencies, the state Transportation Department has entered into agreements with about 70 statewide acequias, including 54 in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar, to allow the DOT to remove debris from silted-in acequias. FEMA then reimburses DOT for the associated costs. 
Acequia steward strains to get help to recover historic southern NM irrigation systems

About 67 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon acequias also have pending claims with the FEMA office overseeing a $5.45 billion fund aimed to compensate victims of the fire, according to Garcia’s presentation.
Garcia called on the state Legislature to find ways to help acequias pay the upfront costs and to formalize a system to remove debris from acequias. 
She also called on the state to create its own version of the Emergency Watershed Protection program, which is popular among acequias and also reliant on an agency undergoing staffing cuts. 
According to various reports, NRCS laid off at least 35 people locally.
“NRCS is a really wonderful agency, and it’s tragic to see those cuts,” Garcia said. “I think there’ll be implications for these programs if those cuts continue.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0556-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

COTS, a housing and shelter services nonprofit, has announced a new campaign to help complete a new, larger adult overnight shelter in Burlington that’s expected to open in December.
Having successfully met the $200,000 challenge grant announced in May, COTS has launched a final $200,000 challenge grant, provided by the Courtney and Victoria Buffum Family Foundation, to close a final funding gap, according to a press release.
“This project is about much more than bricks and mortar, it’s about dignity, hope, and a
fresh start,” Jonathan Farrell, executive director of COTS, formerly known as the Committee on Temporary Shelter, wrote in the release.

The $400,000 COTS is hoping to raise will help renovate a downtown former Social Security building bought in January to create a more modern, spacious, ADA-compliant night shelter.
The current night shelter on Church Street, called the Waystation, has long outgrown the space and demand. In the last fiscal year, it served 159 people.
The new 7,361-square-foot property at 58 Pearl St. will triple the space available in the Waystation and provide beds for up to 56 adults, allowing COTS to expand its shelter services by 55%. The current location will be converted into permanent affordable housing.

“We’re proud to support this campaign and hope this challenge will inspire others to help COTS cross the finish line,” he wrote in the release.

Youngkin focused on education and tapped into parents’ anger over pandemic policies and classroom lessons in his upset win over McAuliffe, also the former Democratic National Committee chairman and chief fundraiser for the campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton. The winning “parents matter” message helped fuel a GOP focus on parents’ rights.

Before resigning to run for governor, Youngkin spent 25 years at The Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C., headquartered private-equity firm , where he became co-CEO in 2018. Youngkin used his personal wealth to fund a large portion of his campaign, spending $20 million of his own money, according to The Associated Press.
His term expires in January 2026.
“His bold, conservative leadership in Virginia has inspired Republicans across the country,” SCGOP Chairman Drew McKissick said in a statement. “He’s shown that strong principles and smart policy win elections — and more importantly, deliver results.”
The black-tie optional event, known as the Silver Elephant Gala, is the SC GOP’s biggest fundraiser of the year.
Past speakers include President Donald Trump in 2023, ahead of his bid for a second term. More than 1,300 people came to hear Trump speak, the largest crowd in the dinner’s history, McKissick previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
Other past headliners include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2021 and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2008, when he was an Indiana congressman. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the speaker in 2020, before Trump’s former White House press secretary announced her bid for governor.
Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was the speaker in 1967 for the inaugural Silver Elephant. Other former presidents to give the keynote address include Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.
The event is scheduled for Aug. 9 in Columbia.
It comes a little over two months after South Carolina Democrats’ own high-dollar fundraiser, the Blue Palmetto Dinner, which was headlined by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore. Attendees also heard from 2024 vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Youngkin-2025-session_Charlotte-Rene-Woods-VA-Mercury-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)About a dozen state disability case managers spent their lunch break outside a Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) brick office building in Cranston — not to eat, but to protest what they say is a lack of action on staffing shortages and dragging their feet on pay negotiations.
The case managers, organized under SEIU Local 580, have been working without a contract since July 2024. They have asked for a higher pay grade in line with what similar workers make at the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).
But Matthew Gunnip, a DCYF case manager and president of SEIU Local 580, told Rhode Island Current that BHDDH managers rejected the proposal without offering an alternative.
“Good faith bargaining is coming with a counter proposal,” he said, standing in the grass as temperatures reached the mid 80s. “That’s not leadership.”
Gunnip acknowledged the state’s tight budget but said that lawmakers have given BHDDH more than enough funding to bump pay for the 16 budgeted “conflict-free” case managers. Conflict-free case managers are tasked with helping clients be more involved and independent in the community.
BHDDH has a budget of roughly $219 million for fiscal year 2026.
“Like other health care and human services employers, BHDDH is navigating a challenging labor market,” BHDDH spokesperson Randal Edgar said in an email. “The department wishes to address concerns raised by employees and is scheduled to meet with the union on July 8.”
The biggest concern for case managers is pay. A job posting from nine months ago lists the salary range between $61,460 and $71,507 per year.
“That may sound like a lot, but living on that is challenging,” case manager Alex Blue said. “We have to have cars that work, insurance is expensive, living is extremely expensive, and food is getting more expensive.”
Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, joined the unionized case managers for the lunchtime 45-minute press conference arranged by SEIU Local 580. Rhode Island was one of three news outlets that attended. 
“Our frontline caseworkers are being burnt out,” he said. “Having to continuously take on higher case loads and work environments that are just plain stressful.”
Erin MacDougall, who started work as a case manager for the state last August, knows those stresses all too well. 
“I’ve lost weight, and I’ve lost hair,” she told reporters.
MacDougall said she’s had to juggle 45 clients, some of whom are unhoused. Clients include a man with continued to stay at home for five days with the body of his dead father, and someone who was so severely malnourished they weighed 69 pounds. She said case managers are effectively doing two jobs: acting as frontline social workers while also drafting individualized plans for each client, which had been a separate role.
“It’s now a brand-new, unmanageable responsibility,” MacDougall said. “This task is intently time-consuming and complex with many steps and constant changes, as many clients are new to BHDDH.”
Crafting a plan, she said, requires multiple meetings with clients. That’s on top of the monthly check-ins that case managers are required to conduct, which involves driving across the state to connect with clients in person. Some, MacDougall said, require weekly or daily check-ins.
“It’s constantly putting out fires,” MacDougall told reporters.
Because of the high-stress workload, MacDougall said she’s seen five case managers leave the job. But Edgar said he believed there are now three open positions, which he said were in the process of being filled. 
As of Tuesday, the state’s job portal lists three open positions at BHDDH: a clinical psychologist, janitor, and certified occupational therapy assistant.

,California,2025-07-01 21:32:29+00:00,CalMatters,California schools are scrambling as Trump administration withholds almost $811 million,Tara García Mathewson and Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/07/education-funding-california/,"California districts have not received Congressionally appropriated money for after school programs, academic enrichment, English-learner services, teacher professional development and migrant education.","In summary
California districts have not received Congressionally appropriated money for after school programs, academic enrichment, English-learner services, teacher professional development and migrant education.




California school districts are short hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant money they had already budgeted for this year. While Congress approved the funds as part of its 2025 budget, the Trump Administration today refused to release them, sending districts across the country scrambling.
The grant money pays for teacher professional development, after school and other enrichment programs, services for students learning English and migrant education. Across all five programs the money funds, California schools are due almost $811 million, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute. Nationwide, the grants total $6.2 billion for K-12 schools. 
After Congress approves the total funding amounts, the U.S. Department of Education has historically discussed state-level allocations between March and May, releasing the money on July 1. On Monday, states received an email saying the department was still reviewing 2025 funding for the five affected programs. In many California districts, that money was built into school budgets this spring and administrators expected to start spending it this month and next. 
Without the money, some school districts will have to cancel teacher professional development events this summer and summer learning activities as soon as this week. 
“The harm of this decision is immediate. The costs are real and the impact is long lasting,” said Tatia Davenport, director of the California Association of School Business Officials. “By withdrawing those funds, our district leaders will be forced to reduce staff, delay programs and cancel services. That means disrupting the learning for the students who need us the most.”

The state is considering several options, including suing the Trump administration, said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. The state has sued Trump over school funding several times already, after Trump threatened to withhold funding over diversity and other initiatives. 
Meanwhile, Thurmond encouraged school districts to find resources to keep summer programs running, in hopes of a resolution soon. Schools start re-opening in late July with the majority opening in August.
Student services at risk
Among the programs that didn’t receive funding is the 21st Century Community Learning Center grants, which provide about $146.6 million to California schools and community organizations for after-school programs. The state provides the bulk of after-school funding, but 21st Century grants are the primary source of money for middle and high schools. The money pays for tutoring, snacks, field trips, enrichment activities and other investments intended to help students stay on track academically while gaining social skills and having fun.
Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, called after school and summer learning programs an American success story, providing a lifeline for working parents. She said every hour of delay on the federal funds could lead to closures and cancellations that will ripple into the start of the 2025-26 school year.
“It’s going to mean more children and youth are unsupervised, and at risk, more academic failures, more hungry kids, more chronic absenteeism, higher dropout rates, more parents forced out of their jobs and a less STEM-ready and successful workforce as our child care crisis worsens dramatically,” she said. 
In the Oxnard School District, in Ventura County, Superintendent Anabolena DeGenna said the programs this federal money supports “are not luxuries in our schools; they’re lifelines,” supporting student services, teacher training and critical family engagement programs that help caregivers support their children. All of this as the district continues to recover from challenges brought on by the COVID pandemic.
The U.S. Department of Education has released some money Congress approved for K-12 schools this year as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and its various programs. All of the withheld funding was destined for programs the administration has proposed defunding in 2026. 
Amaya Garcia, director of PreK-12 research and practice at the left-leaning D.C. think tank New America, said this is not a coincidence. 
“By [withholding] these funds, the Trump administration is finding a way to enact their budget priorities without the approval of Congress,” Garcia said. 
In the department’s Monday email to states, it said it “remained committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” 
Education leaders and advocates roundly condemned the funding delays and the administration’s claims that it had anything to review. 
“There’s nothing to review from the department because Congress has already approved this funding back in March,” said Amalia Chamorro, director of education policy for UnidosUS, the largest Latino civil rights organization in the country. “This action is illegal and it is an overreach of the executive branch,” she continued. “We are calling on the administration to stop playing politics and immediately release these funds without further delay. Our students deserve better.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/102924-BILINGUAL-RECOVERY-LV_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Shelley Moore Capito’s post on X — which also said Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney Matt Harvey was nominated to serve as U.S. Attorney for the northern half of the state — did not make mention of the relationship between her and Moore Capito. 

Thrilled and extremely proud that @POTUS has chosen two stellar candidates to be West Virginia’s U.S. Attorneys, Matt Harvey in the Northern District and Moore Capito in the Southern District. I look forward to supporting their quick confirmations so they can get to work on…
— Shelley Moore Capito (@SenCapito) July 1, 2025

Her social media praise for her son’s appointment came just four minutes after she voted in support of her party’s “big, beautiful bill,” which narrowly passed the U.S. Senate 51 to 50. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote on the legislation.
The bill slashes funding to the Medicaid program and shifts significant costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states for the first time. West Virginians in particular are especially reliant on those social safety nets, according to numerous advocacy groups.
In a statement Tuesday, the West Virginia Democratic Party accused Shelley Moore Capito of trading her vote on the spending bill for Moore Capito’s nomination.
“One has to wonder why Sen. Capito would be such an enthusiastic cheerleader for a bill that is so devastating to West Virginia and its citizens,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, chair of the Democratic Party, in a statement. “One logical explanation is that she’s holding out for a deal… her vote in exchange for her son’s political advancement. If so, that’s not public service — that’s corruption.”
Moore Capito previously sat as a Republican in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 2016-2023. While there, he served as chair for the House Judiciary Committee.
In 2024, he ran a failed gubernatorial campaign, garnering 27.6% of votes — the second-highest vote getter in the race, which was split between four major candidates — in the Republican primary. He lost to current Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who won 33.3% of Republican primary votes.
In a statement on X, Moore Capito said being nominated by Trump was “an honor” and that “Trump’s commitment to law and order is making our state safer and stronger.”
During his Republican run for governor, Moore Capito regularly made “sanctuary cities” and anti-transgender rhetoric staples of his campaign materials, including in TV ads, mailers and more.
Most recently, Moore Capito works as an attorney representing “publicly-traded and privately-held clients in corporate mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as well as business structuring, governance, commercial contracts, and real estate transactions” at the Babst Calland law office.
Harvey, Trump’s nominee for U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of West Virginia, has served as the Jefferson County prosecutor since 2017. 
He also currently sits as chairman of the West Virginia First Foundation, a private nonprofit created by the state Legislature in 2023 to distribute an expected $1 billion in opioid settlement funds across West Virginia.
Both Moore Capito and Harvey will have to be confirmed by Congress before taking the offices they’re nominated for.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Central Iowans can fill their pools, use a water slide enjoy other at-home water activities this Fourth of July weekend, though a lawn watering ban for the region remains in effect due to high nitrate levels in source water rivers. 
The update, given at a Tuesday press conference with Central Iowa Water Works, followed the public release of a water quality report, commissioned by Polk County, that tagged agriculture as the main contributor to the nitrate problem. 
Iowa Capital Dispatch obtained a copy of the first-of-its-kind Central Iowa Source Water Research Assessment report earlier this month. According to the report, nearly 80% of nitrates in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers can be directly traced to agriculture. 
These rivers are the source water for several systems in the Central Iowa Water Works regional water production authority which issued its first lawn watering ban June 12 in order to reduce demand on the system enough to keep water output levels below federal safe drinking water limits, or below 10 milligrams of nitrate per liter. 
Polk County Board Chair Matt McCoy said in a statement about the water quality report, he hopes it will “lead to further investments in improving our watersheds.” 
“We hope that residents and community groups use this report as a guide to advocate and take positive actions to improve water quality at local, state and national level,” McCoy said in the statement.
Tami Madsen, executive director for CIWW, said the regional water group would “need some time” to review the study and determine if, or how, it could utilize the study. 
“We are grateful that there are so many scientists involved in the discussion, but right now, we’re really focused on continuing to provide safe drinking water to all of our 600,000 water users,” she said when asked about the report. 
Madsen said Tuesday she had not spoken with either McCoy or Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig about the report. 
Naig said in a social media post Thursday “no one source or activity is the singular cause or solution” to central Iowa’s high nitrate issue. 
“The blame game is unproductive,” Naig wrote. “There is work to be done on both sides of the point/non-point source equation … Every Iowan has a role to play in improving water quality.” 
Nitrate levels in the Des Moines River and especially in the Raccoon River have fluctuated over the past week, with levels reaching as low as 6 milligrams per liter in the latter. 

CIWW maintains that water remains safe for drinking and cooking. Customers on the system are also able to water their gardens as needed under the ban. 

Ted Corrigan, CIWW’s system operator, said heavy rains filled the Raccoon River almost to full banks, which diluted the nitrate levels. But river fullness doesn’t last. 
“After that surface water runoff passes, the nitrate levels climb back up to where they were before the rain, or sometimes even a little higher because of additional nutrients being washed off the landscape,” Corrigan said. 
As of Tuesday, nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon River were 15.9 mg/l, 12.3 mg/l in the Des Moines River and treated water coming out of CIWW plants were slightly above 7 mg/l. 
Lawn watering ban in place until further notice
Madsen said it is still difficult to articulate a timeline for when the ban will be lifted. She said CIWW would need to observe a “sustained, consistent downward trend” in the source waters before the ban could be lifted. Madsen said the rivers would need to be at least below the federal drinking water standards of 10 mg/l for a period of time. 
Madsen said CIWW also plans to work in a “phased lifting” of the ban to help businesses, namely sod farms and the turf-grass industry, return to work. 
Lawn watering, according to Madsen and CIWW, can account for 30 million to 40 million gallons of water demand, daily, on the system which is why it is the easiest way to cut down demand. 
Madsen said pools and water slides are a “very insignificant fraction” of the total capacity and CIWW is confident it can handle the demand. In an email following the conference, CIWW officials said pool filling should be done “slowly” to help spread out demand.
“We need everyone’s continued help and cooperation in observing the lawn watering ban to begin moving forward with a phased approach to lift restrictions,” Madsen said.

The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
 Sell-off proposal

The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
 States’ role

While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
 Other proposals

While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

The program drew scrutiny from the state auditor due to its slow rollout. Now, Vermont State University leaders say they will invest in expanding their dental hygiene program instead.

Despite years of work and more than $2 million spent, the Vermont State Colleges system announced it would stop working to create a dental therapy program. 
“After nearly a decade of diligent effort, it has become clear that the dental therapy program is not a viable path forward to address our state’s acute and pressing oral health workforce challenges,” Elizabeth Mauch, Vermont State Colleges’ chancellor, said in a press release Monday. 
“We are committed to investing where we can have the greatest impact — and that is in our highly successful and expanding Dental Hygiene Program,” Mauch continued.
Vermont State University offers the dental hygiene degree and would have operated the dental therapy program. The school runs an on-campus dental clinic in Williston. 
A dental therapist is a position analogous to a nurse practitioner and allowed to perform more procedures than a dental hygienist. In Vermont, a shortage of dental professionals has contributed to insufficient access to oral care. 
In 2016, the Legislature paved the way for the dental therapy initiative, which would have been the first of its kind in the northeast. Supporters argued the new professional certification would help address the state’s dental needs. The state allocated $400,000 to help establish the college course.
But the program struggled to get off the ground, drawing scrutiny in 2023 from State Auditor Doug Hoffer, who investigated its delayed launch.
The Vermont State Dental Society had opposed the dental therapy licensure, arguing it would lower the standard of oral care in Vermont. 
In a statement, Jeff Blasius, the society’s president, said the group is glad the state college system “is committed to expanding its dental hygiene program and stands ready to assist in that effort any way we can.”
In a feasibility assessment of the cancelled program dated last month, Mauch wrote that the school couldn’t pay would-be staff enough to recruit them away from the dental field and into teaching. And if the college could pay market rate, the per-student cost of the initiative — estimated at $96,000 — would be too much. Plus, the state colleges’ budget problems — and the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic — further undermined development.
According to the assessment, the state college system needs to find $5 million in “structural budget savings” for the new fiscal year that began July 1 to fully balance its budget.
Kayla Dewey, an assistant to Mauch, said in an email that the cost of the program’s development is $2.3 million, but of that total, $1.5 million worth of equipment, supplies and facilities improvement would go toward expanding the state’s dental hygiene program.
That expansion, bolstered by more than $6 million in “newly secured” federal funds, will increase the dental hygiene program’s enrollment from 24 to 48 students starting in the fall of 2027.

While the Democratic-led Senate advanced its general government and education budget proposals months ago, the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives have yet to put forth their own proposal for general government funding, though the chamber passed its K-12 budget and its higher education budget on June 11. 
Although lawmakers are legally required to pass a budget by the end of July 1, there is no penalty if they exceed the deadline. However, failing to pass a budget before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 would result in a government shutdown. 
For months Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) downplayed the July 1 deadline, later shifting course on June 18, telling reporters that the House would make a good faith effort to finalize the state’s education budget on time.

Michigan schools pass their budgets at the end of June, and have faced uncertainty without a deal to work off of. 
Senate PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) identified Hall as a direct obstacle to negotiations, telling reporters that if he and his House counterpart Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township) were given free rein to negotiate, they’d have something together pretty quickly.
While some schools have already moved forward with their budgets, Brinks and Camilleri both said they’d heard from school leaders that they’d rather have a good budget rather than a rushed budget.

Despite Camilleri’s comments about Hall, he, Brinks and Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) were reticent when asked about the sticking points in their negotiations out of concern of undermining any active conversations. 
One area of agreement, Camilleri noted, is that both chambers wanted a higher per-pupil allowance for students in the education budget, but getting to a number will be difficult when looking at how much money can be spent in each of those budgets. 
And while there would not be a complete deal by the deadline, Brinks stressed that the Senate would continue to do its due diligence to reach a solution, whether it takes weeks and months.
“We have been in conversation with the three legs of this stool on an ongoing basis, they have been present in all of those and continue to be there. And so I won’t characterize their positions at all, but just to say that we are actively engaged with the House, the [Executive Office of the Governor] and the Senate, and will continue to have those conversations to iron out differences and come to a negotiated agreement on any and all budgets, and to do so as expediently as possible,” Brinks said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3846-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

Infected child may have exposed people in Casper hospital’s ER waiting room to highly contagious virus.
The post Wyoming reports first measles case since 2010 appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s first reported measles case since 2010 may have exposed some people at the state’s largest hospital to the highly contagious virus, the Wyoming Department of Health said Tuesday.
Health officials confirmed the measles case in an unvaccinated child who lives in Natrona County. It’s unclear how that child was exposed to the virus, according to the health department.
Wyoming’s first case in 15 years comes amid increasing measles outbreaks nationally and in the Mountain West. All of Wyoming’s neighbors, save for Idaho and Nebraska, have reported cases in the past four weeks, according to a tally kept by NBC News.
The infected Natrona County child visited the emergency department waiting room at Banner Wyoming Medical Center in Casper on two occasions last week: 

11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on June 24.
12:55 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. on June 25.

People in that waiting room during those times could have been exposed to measles, the health department reported. State health officials were working with the hospital to notify those individuals.
“We are asking individuals who were potentially exposed to self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days past the exposure date, and consider avoiding crowded public places or high-risk settings such as daycare centers,” State Health Office Dr. Alexia Harrist said in a statement. 
That’s especially critical for people not vaccinated for the measles, mumps and rubella, commonly known as the MMR vaccine.
Measles is notably contagious: Nine out of 10 people near an infected person will become infected themselves without protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Measles symptoms, which can appear one or two weeks after exposure, include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus can cause serious health complications — especially in kids under 5 years old, according to the CDC.
The measles vaccine is highly effective, with two doses preventing measles 97% of the time, Harrist said.
Vaccination rates, however, have been falling in the United States. The number of school-aged children vaccinated against measles fell from 95% to 92% between 2019 and 2023, according to Harvard Health. Herd immunity for measles requires a 95% vaccination rate, the World Health Organization reported.
In Wyoming, vaccine exemptions have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Meanwhile, the number of Wyoming kindergartners who received the MMR vaccine has ticked down from 97.5% during the 2012-13 school year to 93.5% in 2023-24, according to CDC data.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a vaccine skeptic who’s been criticized for his response to the national outbreak and for his inconsistent stance on the measles vaccine in particular.

Panelists included (from left) Jenkins Enterprises owner Steve Jenkins, University of Arkansas at Little Rock economics professor Michael Pakko, Farmers for Free Trade Executive Director Brian Kuehl and state Sen. Blake Johnson. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansans are paying millions more for daily necessities like car parts as a result of tariffs placed on imports by the Trump administration, according to a report from Farmers for Free Trade. 
The national nonprofit discussed the report during a town hall meeting Tuesday in North Little Rock. According to the report, Arkansans paid $747,700 in import taxes for vehicle parts in April 2024, with an average tariff rate of 7.3%. In April 2025, that number more than tripled to $3.5 million, with the average tariff rate reaching 27.3%.
Vehicle parts are especially exposed to the tariffs instituted by President Donald Trump in response to what he has described as unfair trade practices by other countries. American car manufacturers have increasingly turned to Canada and Mexico for manufacturing parts for their vehicles in recent years, with more than half of American vehicles and parts coming from those two countries.
But the tariffs — and the back-and-forth they have created for businesses as the administration announced new levies and then backed away from them in order to negotiate — don’t only affect car parts. Arkansas also imports hand tools and air pumps and fans from other countries, and paid large tariff costs as a result.
“Arkansas companies have already experienced sharp tariff increases in March and April of this year. But the breadth of these proposed trade actions — if fully enacted — could result in even more severe cost burdens in the months ahead,” the report said.
The broader trade war also poses risk for agriculture, the state’s largest industry. 
During a panel discussion at Tuesday’s town hall at Jenkins Enterprises, longtime farmer and Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson said he believed the tariffs could force 20-30% of U.S. farmers to close their doors by December if relief doesn’t come, even as he said that tariffs were necessary and needed “so we can sell and buy in a fair market.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Farmers face a double-whammy from tariffs. They have high input costs for items like tractor parts and fertilizer that could increase more because of tariffs. Johnson said fertilizer that cost $450 a ton last year now costs close to $650.
Tariffs imposed by other nations in retaliation for U.S. import taxes are another risk. For example, about half of the state’s soybean exports were sent to China last year, according to the report. But after Trump levied tariffs on Chinese goods, the east Asian country imposed reciprocal tariffs on American-grown crops. Soybean exports from the U.S. to China were down 43.7% in April compared to the same time last year.
“That’s why we see the 50% fall off in Arkansas exports of soybeans, because our soybeans now are more expensive when we’re trying to sell into overseas markets [as a result of reciprocal tariffs],” said Brian Kuehl, the executive director of Farmers for Free Trade. 
Trump has argued that businesses should absorb the tariff costs. Short-term pain is necessary for long-term gain, he and his allies have said, in order to bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S.
However, Steve Jenkins, the owner of Jenkins Enterprises, which makes branded products such as Arkansas Razorbacks flags and coffee cups, said that while the administration’s goal was admirable, it was not necessarily possible.
“People will say to me, ‘Well, why don’t you just buy it in America?’ Because those products are no longer made in America, and one of the reasons for that is simply because we don’t have enough people to do it,” Jenkins said.
The issue, Jenkins said, was that even if manufacturing came back to the U.S., there wouldn’t be a workforce to fill those jobs. As America’s economy developed, he said, manufacturing of many goods was sent to Japan, then Taiwan. And as those countries’ economies developed and began focusing on more complex products, some of that manufacturing then made its way to China.
“We’ve got jobs in America, we don’t have workers…those jobs are not going to come back to America,” he said. “They’re not going to be available in America, and we just don’t have the workers to support it.”
The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.2% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, existing U.S. manufacturing has continued to contract, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Respondents to its June survey said broad uncertainty as a result of the tariffs has impacted their orders.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

Free.,Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-tells-states-its-freezing-68-billion-k-12-school-programs,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has put on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools, according to an Education Department notice obtained by States Newsroom.The agency informed states on Monday that it would be withholding funding for several programs, including before- and after-school programs, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives.But the agency notified states just a day ahead of July 1 — the date these funds are typically sent out as educators plan for the coming school year.“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the Education Department wrote to states.The notice, which did not provide any timeline, said the funds are under review and “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year.”The affected programs, according to the Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, include:Title I-C, on migrant educationTitle II-A, on improving the effectiveness of teachers and school leadersTitle III-A, on English language acquisitionTitle IV-A, on STEM education, college and career counseling and other activitiesTitle IV-B, on before- and after-school programs and summer school programsGrants geared toward adult education and literacy programsStates have been on the lookout for these funds. For instance, just last week, Oklahoma’s Department of Education reported that it had yet to get money from the federal government for migrant education, English language acquisition and other programs, according to Oklahoma Voice. ‘Winding down’ the departmentAdding fuel to the fire, Trump is looking to eliminate all these programs as part of his fiscal 2026 budget request. That wish list, according to a department summary, calls for $12 billion in total spending cuts at the agency.That proposed $12 billion cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,” the document notes.Meanwhile, a coalition of 16 states is also suing the Trump administration over the cancellation earlier this year of roughly $1 billion in school mental health grants — a different piece of school funding — to try to restore that money.The lawsuit was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle. The states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin.Uncertainty createdIn a Tuesday statement, Washington state U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate spending panel, urged the Trump administration to immediately release the frozen funds.“President Trump himself signed this funding into law — but that isn’t stopping him from choking off resources to support before and after school programs, help students learn, support teachers in the classroom, and a lot more,” Murray said. “The uncertainty he has created has already forced districts to delay hiring and other initiatives to help students. The only question left now is how much more damage this administration wants to inflict on our public schools.”“Local school districts can’t afford to wait out lengthy court proceedings to get the federal funding they’re owed — nor can they make up the shortfall, especially not at the drop of a pin,” Murray added.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, blasted the administration’s actions, saying this is “another illegal usurpation of the authority of the Congress” and “directly harms the children in our nation.”“K-12 public school leaders across the country who should have been able to start planning months ago for the summer and the upcoming school year are instead left mired in financial uncertainty,” added Weingarten, who leads one of the largest teachers unions in the country.Approved by CongressCarissa Moffat Miller, CEO of the Council of Chief State School Officers, said “the administration must make the full extent of title funding available in a timely manner,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom on Tuesday.“These funds were approved by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in March,” Miller said. “Schools need these funds to hire key staff and educate students this summer and in the upcoming school year.""In response to a request for comment on the frozen funds, the Education Department referred States Newsroom to the Office of Management and Budget, which is responsible for administering the federal budget and overseeing the performance of departments throughout the federal government.OMB did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s inquiry.",,,,2025-07-01 18:07:52.296274

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)FARGO — North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Tuesday said the state didn’t need to collect a lot of data to realize that farmers have an urgent need for grain storage after storms swept across the state last month. 
The state has responded with a program to help farmers pay for temporary storage through low-interest loans and repair and replace damaged farm assets such as barns, irrigation systems, bins and grain-handling equipment.
He called the program an area “where the state could do the most good, the fastest,” Armstrong said in a press conference at North Dakota State University. 
Storm impact on North Dakota agriculture ‘tremendous,’ ag commissioner says

Farmers can apply for the Grain Storage and Facility Rebuilder Program starting July 9 by contacting their banker. 
Farmers can get up to a $150,000 loan for temporary storage. 
The repair and rebuild program will take into account insurance settlements from the storm.
If the cost of rebuilding exceeds the insurance payment by 25% of the farmer’s net worth or $500,000 (whichever is less) collateral may be required.
Both loan options have a maximum term of 24 months at an interest rate of 2% while requiring an annual interest-only payment. All remaining principal and interest will be due when the loan matures. 
The program will be paid for with up to $37 million from the state’s emergency fund and will be administered by the Bank of North Dakota. 
The Bank of North Dakota will also coordinate directly with grain elevators impacted by storms.
“We wanted this to be as flexible as possible,” Armstrong said. 
More information on the program from BND can be found at bnd.nd.gov/gsfr.

High winds and tornadoes on June 20-21 damaged property and crops from near Bismarck across the eastern half of the state and into Minnesota. Four people were killed by the storms.
Steve Johnson, a farmer from Page, northwest of Fargo, joined Armstong Tuesday in announcing the loan program. 
He had storage for 400,000 bushels of grain. After the storm, he has zero. 
The storms hit with corn and soybean harvest about two months away. Small grains, such as wheat, will be harvested even sooner. 
North Dakota State University Extension is gathering data on storm damage to agriculture with more than 100 responses so far. Miranda Meehan, the disaster education coordinator for Extension, said Tuesday that data will be aggregated and reported at the county level, with no information collected that would identify an individual farm. 
Armstrong declared a statewide disaster after the storms.
Tuesday, he encouraged all farmers with damage to talk with their banker about the state program as a first step in recovery from storms. 
He said he has been in contact with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins about federal assistance but said the state needs to compile more information. 
He said he told Rollins, “I don’t know what I am asking for yet but you’re going to get an ask.”

Kevin Stitt explains the new safety guidelines for Oklahoma events developed by an advisory council he led on June 5, 2025 at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday praised a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that said the state can impose income taxes on tribal members living and working on a reservation.
Stitt called the 6-3 ruling a big win for the state.
“Tribal governments, liberal groups, and some elected officials have pushed for special tax exemptions that would create a two-tiered system – one set of rules for tribal citizens and another for everyone else,” Stitt said. “That’s wrong. It would divide our state and weaken the public services every family relies on.”
The case was closely watched because it could have expanded the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in McGirt to civil matters.
The McGirt ruling held that the state could not prosecute certain crimes committed by tribal members on the reservation.
“This ruling makes it clear that attempts to expand McGirt into civil and tax matters have no basis in the law,” Stitt said.
In its Tuesday ruling, the Oklahoma Supreme Court found that McGirt, decided in 2020, was narrowly limited to criminal jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act.
“The United States Supreme Court’s declaration – 113 years after statehood – that nearly half of Oklahoma is a reservation is unprecedented,” the ruling said. “To date, the United States Supreme Court has not extended its ruling to McGirt beyond the Major Crimes Act. To date, the United States Supreme Court has not extended its ruling in McGirt to the State’s civil or taxing jurisdiction. And it is not this Court’s place to do so.”
Alicia Stroble had sought a tax exemption for years 2017, 2018, and 2019, saying she was exempt because she was a Muscogee (Creek) Nation member, worked for the tribe and lived on her tribes’ land.
The Muscogee Nation was disappointed by the ruling, said Principal Chief David W. Hill in a statement.
“Ever since the McGirt ruling, we have seen Oklahoma state courts go through legal gymnastics to come up with results that are not in compliance with federal law and that do not even follow pre-McGirt state court precedent on the limits of state authority in Indian country,” Hill said. “The Stroble ruling is another example of those antics.”
The tribe is reviewing the decision and preparing for its next steps, he said.
Michael D. Parks, the attorney representing Stroble, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)You wouldn’t know a contested hike in state taxes on fuel began Tuesday by scanning local gas stations.
Average gas prices in Rhode Island dropped 1 cent per gallon from Monday, and were 2 cents less than the daily average in neighboring Massachusetts, according to AAA. 
Yet the extra 3-cents-per-gallon tax — bringing the per-gallon tax to 41 cents — drew sharp criticism from Gov. Dan McKee. The gas tax was already scheduled to rise by 1 cent per gallon, from 38 to 39 cents, on July 1 before the legislature stepped in to aid the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA).

In a June 25 press conference, McKee blasted lawmakers for “unnecessary” tax and fee increases in the approved fiscal 2026 budget, including on gasoline.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi countered that the revenue from the extra tax on motorists was crucial to shoring up the state’s cash-strapped public bus system.
“RIPTA can’t afford service cuts,” Shekarchi said in an interview Tuesday. “They’re a lifeline for a lot of people.”
But the road to fiscal solvency for RIPTA requires more than raising prices at the pump. Looking to close a remaining $10 million fiscal 2026 shortfall, RIPTA is eyeing service cuts and fare increases, with a series of public hearings starting July 28.
Annual revenue from the state gas tax is already falling amid a rise in electric vehicles and a work-from-home culture that decenters driving. Transit advocates insist the state needs to look for alternative solutions.
“The gas tax is a losing proposition when relying on it to fund transportation infrastructure or public transit because it’s a melting ice cube,” said John Flaherty, senior adviser for Grow Smart RI. “The question is how to fund public transportation in a more stable and robust way, without there being a lot of pain and tradeoffs.”
McKee says the pain has already begun. He insisted the hike in state gas taxes would hurt working families while putting Rhode Island “out of line” with neighboring states. 
Before Tuesday’s increase, Rhode Island already ranked 14th among states for motor fuel taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. Massachusetts remains at 27 cents per gallon, while Connecticut sits at 52 cents per gallon, including a state excise tax and a separate, 8% wholesale tax on petroleum products.
Flaherty acknowledged that Rhode Island’s higher gas tax, compared with Massachusetts, might sway drivers to fill up across state lines. Others may not even notice.
“Some people won’t give it another thought, they just go where it’s convenient,” Flaherty said. “Then you have people who have apps on their phone to check the price at every gas station.”
Shekarchi is among the latter, favoring Harss gas station on Warwick Avenue in Warwick for its competitive prices. He was unsympathetic to McKee’s declaration that raising gas taxes would hurt working families.
“I drive down West Shore Road in Warwick and pass 10 gas stations,” Shekarchi said. “The cost varies by 10 to 12 cents, depending on where you go.”

Will motorists even notice?
Compared with a new, $4 per person monthly fee on state health insurance premiums, the gas tax increase is not a noticeable burden for most people, said Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. 
The business-backed policy group typically opposes tax increases that could jeopardize the state’s economic standing. But DiBiase supported the move to raise gas taxes to create a sustainable revenue source for transportation — something the state has been sorely lacking.
In the fiscal 2025 budget, lawmakers used one-time federal pandemic aid to help RIPTA fill its deficit, making a return to the table inevitable.










The gas tax is a losing proposition when relying on it to fund transportation infrastructure or public transit because it’s a melting ice cube.


– John Flaherty, senior adviser for Grow Smart RI


Throughout the 2025 session, lawmakers considered a host of ideas for more alternative RIPTA funding sources — a straight allocation of general revenue, money from fees on rideshare companies, a mileage-based user fee, and a greater share of the state gas tax. 
Lawmakers last updated the state’s century-old gas tax in 2014, calling for a biennial adjustment in the per-gallon rate based on the Consumer Price Index. But subsequent adjustments only considered inflation from the year immediately prior, rather than the two prior years.
Sen. Samuel Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced legislation to ensure that the two prior years are included in biennial inflation adjustments. Zurier’s bill failed to advance out of committee, but he viewed the budget provision increasing the gas tax for RIPTA’s benefit as achieving the same goal.
Zurier sponsored a second bill, which also stalled in committee, to increase RIPTA’s share of gas tax revenue. 
A short history of the gas tax
Money from the motor fuel tax has historically been divided across a host of state agencies and programs. More than half of funds go to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, with a 27% share to RIPTA. Other beneficiaries include the Rhode Island Bridge and Turnpike Authority, the Office of Healthy Aging, and the Underground Storage Review Board, which receives half of a 1 cent-per-gallon environmental fee tacked on to state gas charges to address underground storage tank leaks. The other half of the 1-cent environmental fee has gone to RIPTA since 2009. A portion of the gas tax revenue is also used to pay down debt service on state transportation bonds backed by future federal highway funding.
The inflation adjustment approved in 2014 has gradually increased the per-gallon tax, from 33 cents when it took effect on July 1, 2015, to 38 cents as of July 1, 2025, according to the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. All of the extra revenue has gone to the state transportation agency, which received 21.25 cents per gallon in fiscal 2024. RIPTA, by comparison, has flatlined at 9.75 cents per gallon — including its 50 percent share of the environmental fee — since fiscal 2010.
With the extra 2 cents per gallon tax that began Tuesday, RIPTA now receives 11.75 cents in tax revenue on every gallon of gas, which is estimated to generate $8.7 million in fiscal 2026. An increased share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, funded by vehicle registration fees, will bring in an extra $5.9 million for RIPTA in fiscal 2026, for a combined $14.8 million boost in the state budget.
Shekarchi backed the pair of structural changes to state funding as “the most fair” option for helping to close RIPTA’s deficit.
“I stand behind it,” he said. “I’d do it again tomorrow.”

Efficiency study or ‘downsizing study’?
But Shekarchi also echoed McKee’s emphasis on a not-yet-complete study of agency operations to address the remaining shortfall.  
“RIPTA has to run efficiently,” Shekarchi said, naming a slight increase in ridership fares, smaller buses and trimming management as potential ways to cut agency costs. He singled out the agency’s partnership with Rhode Island FC, offering free bus rides to attendees at the soccer team’s home games at its new Pawtucket stadium, as a questionable choice given its financial straits.
“That needs to be justified,” he said.
Shekarchi also flagged the agency’s decision to hire a lobbyist to advocate for its funding needs during the 2025 session. RIPTA hired New Harbor Group on May 23, with an $175 hourly rate, according to the state’s public lobbyist tracker. An initial filing from May 2025 shows RIPTA did not give New Harbor any money for lobbying work that month.
David Preston, president of New Harbor Group, said the firm’s agreement with RIPTA is for public relations, not lobbying. Seth Klaiman, executive vice president for New Harbor, registered as a state lobbyist for RIPTA as a precautionary measure due to conversations with lawmakers about the agency’s budget, Preston said in an email Tuesday afternoon.
Cristy Raposo Perry, a RIPTA spokesperson, did not directly respond to Shekarchi’s comments.
“We appreciate the continued support of the Speaker and the General Assembly,” Raposo Perry said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “We remain focused on using these resources as effectively as possible, guided in part by an ongoing efficiency study focused on optimizing operations. Our top priority is to grow ridership and ensure that public transit continues to align with and support the state’s broader economic goals.” 
Flaherty suggested the oft-audited quasi-public agency has little if any operational wiggle room, evidenced by the study consultant recommending service cuts and layoffs to address the immediate, remaining agency shortfall. 
“I honestly don’t look at this as an efficiency study, I look at it as a downsizing study,” he said. “It’s a roadmap of sorts about what services the agency can cut first while minimizing pain or damage.” 
Even with the extra gas tax money, Flaherty feared deeper cuts ahead, especially given the state’s own projections for diminishing gas tax revenue. Estimates adopted by state budget analysts in May projected the revenue stream will drop by more than $7 million through the end of the decade. The estimates do not reflect the extra 2 cents per gallon included in the fiscal 2026 budget, which will appear in biannual projections in November.
Flaherty backed a “value capture” approach already used by other local and state governments in which area-specific taxes and fees on land and development near transit are used to pay for transit operations. Zurier, meanwhile, planned to spend his summer break researching what he suspects is an increasing share of state funds for federally funded highway projects, outstripping spending for public transit.
Shekarchi said he was open to ideas for more funding for RIPTA.
“Every year, everybody comes asking for more money, no matter who it is,” he said.

“I’ll also tell you some of the GREAT things I’ve already done on Trade, especially as it relates to Farmers,” Trump wrote. “You are going to be very happy with what I say — Should be a BIG Crowd!”
Some farmers, agricultural producers and other business owners in Iowa and worldwide expressed concerns about Trump’s tariff plans earlier this year, when he had announced plans to set a baseline 10% levy on all international imports beginning in early April. Though he set a 90-day pause shortly after the announcement on many of these tariffs, that break is set to expire July 9.
The window before tariffs are set to go back into place was meant to give time to countries that have said they are open to negotiating new trade deals. The president has said this deadline could be extended, but has not offered additional details on timelines or ongoing negotiations.
While tariffs have not been finalized for many countries, Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement and levies on certain goods already in place caused massive economic unrest earlier this year. In Iowa, many local business owners and farmers said the tariffs could cause disruptions to their businesses, and lead to higher costs for consumers. A study from the nonprofit advocacy group Farmers for Free Trade found tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by 304%, roughly $68 million, from April 2024 to April 2025.
There are also agricultural producers who say tariffs have not significantly impacted their business outlooks. In the pork industry, where 25% of U.S. pork production is within the export market and 55% of exported U.S. produced pork going to China, some business owners and producers said profitability is up despite trade war concerns.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Georgia kids can continue liking, commenting, and subscribing without notifying their parents this summer after a federal judge put a temporary hold on the state’s new social media age verification law while the case moves forward — but the bill’s author says a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling bodes well for the ban.
Senate Bill 351, which was set to go into effect July 1, would require social media companies to get a parent’s permission before they allowed a minor to create an account. All Georgians would also have to verify their age before accessing websites with material deemed harmful to minors.
On Thursday, Judge Amy Totenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in favor of NetChoice, a coalition of social media companies, who argued that the law as written would likely violate free speech protections.
“The Court does not doubt the dangers posed by young people’s overwhelming exposure to social media,” Totenberg wrote. “But, in its effort to aid parents, the Act’s solution creates serious obstacles for all Georgians, including teenagers, to engage in protected speech activities and would highly likely be unconstitutional.”
Totenberg said the law would curb the speech rights of young people, impose a burden on all Georgians to participate in online speech, potentially put Georgians’ private data at risk, and step into parents’ decisions on how to raise their children.
But Totenberg said the law’s biggest downfall comes in its long list of exemptions, which include news, sports, and entertainment sites, interactive gaming platforms, streaming services, and more.
“For example, SB 351 would presumably apply to the Georgia Bulldogs Reddit forum, which features user-generated content. But it would exempt Barstool Sports, which features provider-generated content. It would apply to news coverage posted by users on X, but not news coverage posted by The New York Times to its own liveblog.”
Totenberg found that amounts to a content-based restriction on speech, which triggers a higher level of scrutiny – which she said Georgia’s law doesn’t meet.
“Because of the enormous burdens imposed on the First Amendment rights of children, adults, and social media platforms — along with the significant tailoring issues inherent in the law — even the State’s serious interest here cannot justify SB 351 under the First Amendment’s rigorous standards,” she said.
NetChoice celebrated the win in a statement.
“This is a major victory for free speech, constitutional clarity and the rights of all Georgians to engage in public discourse without intrusive government overreach,” said Chris Marchese, NetChoice director of litigation. “We are grateful the court recognized what we’ve long argued: SB 351 isn’t just poorly crafted — it’s profoundly unconstitutional.”
Short-lived win
But the bill’s author, state Sen. Jason Anavitarte, a Dallas Republican who is now the Senate majority leader, said their victory is likely to be short-lived.
In a statement, Anavitarte pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that backed a Texas state law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.
“One day after liberal Obama Appointee, US District Court Judge, Amy Totenberg, issued an injunction preventing Georgia’s age verification law from taking effect, The Supreme Court found that laws like SB 351 ‘have only an incidental effect on protected speech and that The First Amendment leaves undisturbed States’ traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective….Requiring proof of age is an ordinary and appropriate means of enforcing an age-based limit on obscenity to minors,’” Anavitarte said.
“Based on Friday’s ruling at The Supreme Court, Judge Totenberg should be left with no choice but to allow SB 351 to go into effect,” he added. “I am immensely grateful for Justice Clarence Thomas’ well written opinion and remain optimistic that SB 351 will go into effect in its entirety.”
A Texas court issued a similar finding, uphold that state’s social media law.
Attorney General Chris Carr’s Office said Carr intends to appeal the ruling.
“We will continue to defend commonsense measures that empower parents and protect our children online,” said Carr spokesperson Kara Murray.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-01 20:57:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont doubles down on natural gas after signing two climate-related bills,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/ned-lamont-ct-climate-bills-natural-gas/,"Immediately after signing the bills, Lamont reiterated his support for a chief cause of concern among climate advocates: fracked natural gas.","Within minutes if signing legislation on Tuesday that pledged to put Connecticut on a path toward reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, Gov. Ned Lamont flipped the script by reiterating his support for one of climate advocates’ chief causes of concern: an expansion of pipelines carrying fracked natural gas.
Specifically, the Democratic governor hinted that he’d been engaged in talks with the Trump administration and state leaders in New York about building or expanding pipelines that could deliver more gas to Connecticut and the rest of New England.
“We’ll see, but it’s back on the table,” Lamont told reporters, without offering further details. 
Lamont’s comments were delivered immediately after he signed two of Democrats’ priority climate bills passed during this year’s legislative session. The first, House Bill 5004, set the state’s net-zero emissions target and added incentives for solar canopies, energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, green jobs and sustainability-focused businesses.
The term “net-zero” refers to a point where any greenhouse gases produced by humans are offset with carbon-capture technologies or natural means such as reforestation. There are no penalties under the bill if the state fails to reach that target. 
The other legislation, Senate Bill 9, included several climate-resiliency measures along with tougher restrictions on the use of rat poisons and class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids.  
The juxtaposition between the governor’s praise of the climate legislation and his embrace of natural gas was jarring for several of the advocates who have fought for years against the expansion of gas pipelines. They argue pipelines can leak potent methane gases, and increase dependency on fossil fuel power plants, making it harder for the state to fulfill its promise to slash emissions.
“It was horrific to hear,” said Sam Dynowski, director of the Sierra Club’s Connecticut chapter, who had posed for photos behind the governor as he signed both bills into law Tuesday.
“It’s as dirty as coal when you add up the combustion emissions and the leaks,” Dynowski said. “So we cannot bring more gas into Connecticut if we really want to solve the climate crisis.” 
It was not the first time that Lamont has angered advocates with his pitch for natural gas. As if sensing that pushback again on Tuesday, Lamont said that a larger gas supply is necessary to wean the region off its reliance on aging, oil-fired plants that are needed to meet demand in winter months.
“We’re taking out some things that are even more polluting,” Lamont said. 
“Long term, what it means if we got more gas up from, say, the Pennsylvania area, you know, we’re working on that,” the governor added. “We’re working with all the different players. That doesn’t take our eye off the ball, what we’ve got to do as a state to make sure we stay green and clean.”
On Tuesday, Lamont was asked about a reported deal between Donald J. Trump’s Interior Department and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to allow work to resume on a offshore wind farm, Empire Wind 1. As part of that deal, Trump administration officials said Hochul had signaled her willingness to move forward on pipeline projects that could deliver gas to New England.
Hochul’s office denied that any explicit agreement had been made to approve a pipeline, according to Politico.
Lamont, who met with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in Washington earlier this year, said Tuesday that he had been “clued in” to those discussions around wind and natural gas.
“We were really cheering on Kathy Hochul to make sure that that Empire Wind kept going,” Lamont said. “Trump pulled it back, then he allowed it to go back again, maybe with some relief on what they want to do on natural gas.”
The Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  
One project mentioned by several outlets as a potential chip in negotiations between the states and the federal government is the so-called Constitution Pipeline, which would carry fracked gas from Pennsylvania to upstate New York, where it would connect with existing pipelines serving Connecticut and New England.
The developer behind that proposed pipeline, The Williams Companies, submitted applications with state and federal regulators earlier this year to approve the pipeline, with an estimated completion date in 2027.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_5581-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258

July 1, 2025. | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceElection clerks from across the state spoke up before the House Election Integrity Committee Tuesday, offering their support for a piece of legislation aimed at preserving their say in pre-election testing of voting machines. 
Committee Chair Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), a former election clerk, told her colleagues that for years, local clerks have successfully conducted logic and accuracy testing of their machines by working with vendors of their choosing. However, Smit raised concerns that a recent contract acquired by the Michigan Secretary of State could require clerks to use only their contracted vendor to generate test decks. 
“This represents a fundamental shift from our local control to state mandated centralization, a shift that raises concerns about the integrity, transparency and fiscal responsibility. The bill before us today provides very clear, common sense protections that preserve local autonomy while ensuring proper standards. Specifically it protects local choice,” Smit said.

Smit’s House Bill 4602 states that the Secretary of State cannot bar or restrict local clerks from using any lawful source for creating testing materials.
“Our local clerks are directly accountable to their communities. This legislation ensures that they retain the tools and autonomy necessary to fulfill that responsibility. When problems arise, clerks need direct control over the processes and relationships with their vendors,” Smit said, later emphasizing that local jurisdictions operate under tight budgets. 
However, Smit’s proposal drew some questions, both from the committee’s Democratic members and representatives from the Department of State. 
State Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth) questioned if Smit’s proposal would eliminate all oversight on these kinds of vendors, raising concerns that this could benefit bad actors, or vendors who simply are not good at supplying testing materials. 
However, Smit said the election commission in each county would retain their oversight under her bill.

Adam Fracassi, deputy director of elections for the Michigan Bureau of Elections broke down the contract with Ballot IQ, which is intended to create an expanded form used in testing the voting machines used in the state. This expanded deck would include an additional test to ensure results between different races have not been swapped, he said. 
“The reason for this is in an effort to provide just a stronger safeguard against errors, a stronger safeguard against the processes, and enhance the integrity of our election,” Fracassi said. 
As the bureau begins to roll pieces of this new system out, Fracassi said some clerks were interested in having this deck available as an option, and the bureau is looking at ways to make the test deck available to them. 
“The idea is that this test deck would be available to clerks without cost, so it’s an option for them to be able to utilize it to save them money,” he said.
Having this test deck as an option, not as a requirement, would offer clerks another resource in the testing process, Fracassi said. 
The second part of the contract with Ballot IQ would be to develop an electronic system for clerks to submit ballot proofs to the Bureau of Elections, so the bureau can review them more efficiently.

Michigan’s election law requires county clerks to submit ballot proofs for approval, which Fracassi emphasized is largely done manually, and must be done in a very short period of time. 
“One of the other requirements for the contract is to provide us with additional resources to be able to streamline that a little bit better, to make it faster for us to review ballot proofs, and to make it easier for clerks to transmit the information to us and us to transmit the information back to the county clerks,” Fracassi explained. 
Erin Schor, the Michigan Department of State’s legislative policy director, echoed earlier concerns about Smit’s bill stripping oversight over testing vendors, asking for a potential change to clarify that these vendors would still be subject to the Department’s rules on the testing process.
 The department also holds concerns about one of the bill’s provisions barring the Secretary of State from centralizing ballot information for the purpose of creating test decks. 
“It would be one thing if that just talked about mandating, but I’m concerned that with the language, the way it’s written, if we were in a situation where best practice required Michigan to update our rules, and for some reason, there was only one vendor that was prepared to meet the new threshold at that time, we would not be able to update the rules to meet the best practice,” Schor said. 
Schor also raised concerns about the bill’s requirements for the test deck creation process to be reproducible, noting that the rules they had recently put forth on election system testing were not that specific as far as how to set up the math and programming to create these decks.

While the Department of State did not offer a position on the bill, multiple election clerks offered their support to Smit’s legislation.
Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons, a former Republican state representative, told members of the committee that the contract’s requirements around streamlining the process of sending and keeping ballot proofs means they want official ballots with timing marks, not valid proofs. 
This creates significant security concerns, Posthumus Lyons warned, as holding a centralized record of ballots could result in nefarious action, where these ballots are duplicated and sent out.
She also emphasized that local clerks know what works best for their jurisdictions. 
“I and my colleagues have spent years promoting how transparent testing of our equipment before each and every election ensures the accuracy of our votes. We’ve also touted our decentralized process as an important element of election security,” Posthumus Lyons said. “We can and we should seek to improve our process, but we shouldn’t do so at the expense of foregoing these foundational, tried and true elements that work so well.”
Oakland County Clerk and Register of Deeds Lisa Brown opened her testimony, joking that her agreement with Posthumus Lyons on policy was a historic moment given the pair’s past on opposing sides of the House. 
However, she emphasized that this policy is not a partisan issue, and is solely aimed at preserving the authority of local election commissions to create and oversee their testing process. 
“I understand that it’s being said that it’s an option right now. I’ve also heard that it’s eventually going to be mandated, and that is so problematic,” Brown said, noting her discomfort in sending her ballots to someone she did not contract with. 
“I think that’s problematic. I think it’s overreach, and I think that there is a security issue to it,” she said. 
Extending terms for local office
Prior to hearing testimony on Smit’s policy, the committee also took comments on House Bills 4358, 4359, 4698, 4699, which Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres) said would extend the terms of office for various local elected officials until after election results have been certified by the appropriate board of canvassers. 
Under Proposal 2, approved by voters in the 2022 election, clerks are permitted to tally absentee ballots submitted by servicemembers and overseas voters that are postmarked by election day and received up to six days after election day. 
However, local officials take office not long after the election, meaning they can take office before these ballots are even counted, Hoadley noted.  
The bills also received strong support from the clerks in attendance.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A former South Dakota Department of Social Services employee was sentenced Tuesday to seven years in prison after earlier being convicted of stealing $1.78 million in state and federal funds from the department’s division of Child Protection Services.
“This jury conviction and sentence confirm that public trust is not for sale,” said state Attorney General Marty Jackley in a press release. 
Lonna Carroll, age 68, of Algona, Iowa, was sentenced in Hughes County Circuit Court to pay back the entire amount of her theft and serve 13 years in prison, with six years suspended. She’ll avoid serving those extra years if she complies with all the terms of her sentence. She was convicted in April by a Hughes County Jury on two felony counts of aggravated grand theft.
‘Don’t do that’: Attorney general says guilty verdict in state theft trial sends a message

Carroll’s conviction and sentencing are the highest-profile outcomes in a recent wave of white-collar prosecutions in South Dakota state government, which have also spurred reforms and increased scrutiny on departmental financial controls. Other criminal allegations against state employees have included creating fake vehicle titles to avoid excise taxes, the use of foster family food vouchers for a state employee’s own expenses, and the alleged forging of a state employee’s own medical marijuana card.
During Carroll’s trial, Jackley’s prosecution team laid out a paper trail illustrating Carroll’s scheme, played her recorded confession, and showed a document she signed saying she committed the crimes.
Carroll formerly worked as an administrative assistant for Child Protection Service. Her crimes were discovered by a department employee after Carroll had retired and moved to Iowa.
Carroll’s crimes involved submitting fraudulent financial requests on behalf of children no longer in the state’s care, depositing the funds into accounts opened under their names, and withdrawing the money in cash for herself. Prosecutors said she did that 215 times between 2010 and 2023, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73.

The three University of Iowa international students and one UI international-student graduate are suing Homeland Security for having revoked their status as students — a step they fear could lead to them being detained and deported.
U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger initially issued a short-term temporary restraining order barring Homeland Security from deporting the four, and later, on May 15, granted them the additional protection of a preliminary injunction that is intended to last while the plaintiffs’ underlying case against the government is being litigated.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. The students claim Homeland Security has violated their due process rights by terminating their student status without legal justification or explanation.
Named as defendants in the case are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
Since the injunction was issued on May 15, there has been little activity in the case, with Homeland Security still having filed no formal answer to the students’ original petition, which was filed April 21.
Recently, lawyers for Homeland Security asked for, and received, a 60-day extension of time to either file an answer or a motion to dismiss the case.
As justification, they say “the small civil division for the U.S. Attorney’s Office has recently been experiencing significant staffing shortages,” and the issues raised in the UI case have been the focus of “significant litigation around the country,” resulting in a need for additional time is needed to coordinate any response to the lawsuit with others inside the U.S. Department of Justice.
Also, the government’s lawyers say, the lead counsel for Homeland Security and ICE “will be departing federal service within the next few weeks,” which means the new lead counsel and their team will need more time to familiarize themselves with the case.
The government’s lawyers now have until Aug. 21, 2025, to respond to the students’ lawsuit.
Judge expressed ‘little confidence’ in Homeland Security
In her May 15 decision granting an injunction, Judge Ebinger rejected Homeland Security’s claim that its actions were not arbitrary and capricious – the standard for reversing administrative action, which is what the four UI plaintiffs seek as part of their lawsuit.
The judge noted there was “no suggestion” made by anyone that the four plaintiffs met Homeland Security’s own standards for revoking student status, such as conveying falsehoods to Homeland Security, engaging in unauthorized employment, committing a serious crime or failing to engage in educational studies.
In deciding to issue the injunction, Ebinger also stated that she had “little confidence” that going forward, Homeland Security and ICE would comply with the law and “act consistently with pertinent regulatory factors.”
In a statement that underscores the difficulty lawyers for Homeland Security are likely to face as the underlying case moves forward, Ebinger stated in her decision that “imposing immediate negative consequences on persons while disregarding governing law and regulations is arbitrary and capricious.” The four UI plaintiffs, she said, “have demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits” of their case.
The injunction bars Noem, Homeland Security and ICE from initiating or ordering the arrest, detention, or transfer of the four plaintiffs — Prasoon Kumar, Songli Cai, Haoran Yang, and Sri Chaitanya Krishna Akondy — out of the court’s jurisdiction without first providing adequate notice to the court so the plaintiffs’ counsel can contest any such action.

Ty Pinkins, a former Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2024, announced recently that he would run as an independent candidate for the U.S Senate in 2026. Shuwaski Young, a former Democratic candidate for Congress and Mississippi secretary of state, announced that he will campaign as a Republican for secretary of state in 2027. 
The announcements from the two politicians come in an election cycle where the Democratic Party is trying to make inroads in a state dominated by Republicans. 
Pinkins, a Rolling Fork native, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker in 2024. 
The Delta resident in a recent blog post attributed the lack of support from the state Democratic Party and Democratic officials as part of the reason for his poor performance. Pinkins wrote that certain party leaders were “gatekeepers” who attempted to block him from advancing in politics.
“Gatekeeping is how the party protects its fragile status quo — by silencing anyone who might disrupt it,” Pinkins wrote. “Candidates who challenge convention or dare to ask hard questions are often ignored, undermined, or outright punished.”
If he qualifies to run for the seat, he will challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who has announced she is running for reelection and has the endorsement of President Donald Trump. 
Scott Colom, a state prosecutor in the Golden Triangle area, is considered a likely candidate in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, but he has not publicly announced his plans. 
Young, a Neshoba County native, has worked in various roles at the California Democratic Party, the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama’s administration, and the Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office under former secretaries Eric Clark and Delbert Hosemann.

The Democratic Party nominated Young for secretary of state in 2023, but after the Daily Journal and Secretary of State Michael Watson’s office raised questions about Young’s residency, he withdrew from the race due to medical reasons.
Other candidates who are considering running for secretary of state are Republican state Sen. Jeff Tate of Meridian and Republican state Sen. Joel Carter of Gulfport. Current Secretary of State Michael Watson has not announced his plans, but is widely considered a top contender for lieutenant governor. 
Candidates for U.S. Senate and other congressional offices can begin qualifying in January, and candidates for Mississippi’s statewide elections can begin qualifying for those offices in January 2025.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/05023726/3X0A6264-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-01 20:36:35+00:00,CT Mirror,CT sues Trump administration over funds for mental health services in schools,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/trump-school-mental-health-funding-ct-lawsuit/,The cancelled grant included funds meant to support graduate social work students in providing mental health services in four CT districts.,"Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has joined a lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cancelling certain mental health grants for public schools — including one meant to fund social work interns serving four low-income districts in Connecticut. 
The University of Connecticut’s Graduate School of Social Work had been awarded a five-year grant of just over $3 million as part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which Congress passed in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex. The grant was meant to support 25 graduate students in social work to provide mental health services in four Connecticut school districts — Hartford, New Britain, Waterbury and Vernon.
UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said the program was set to begin this fall. The grant is now set to be terminated in December. 
Along with Tong, sixteen other states signed onto the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on Monday. All the states they represent, with the exception of Nevada, have Democratic governors. 
The federal Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment.
The UConn grant was part of $1 billion that Congress put aside for mental health services in high-need school districts in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The funds have allowed for the hiring of 1,300 mental health professionals and supported almost 775,000 K-12 students across the country, the lawsuit stated.
According to the lawsuit, suicide risk for students in participating high-need schools has dropped by half, while absenteeism and other problematic behavior also decreased. The programs that received funding also have been able to keep many of their mental health workers on staff, which has reduced the amount of time that students have to wait for help. 
In December, UConn announced that it would use $588,000 received through the federal grant to launch the School Social Work Scholars program. The program would send graduate students at the School of Social Work into Hartford, New Britain, Waterbury and Vernon public schools, with the goal of broadening diversity among social workers in those districts. 
Reitz declined to comment further, citing the pending lawsuit. 
In their complaint, the attorneys general called the Trump administration’s move to discontinue the grant as “arbitrary and capricious.” They said the government’s notices that the grants would be discontinued — which programs received in April — contained “boilerplate language” that left unclear the reasons for cuts to each particular program. 
They also claimed the cuts would force districts to lay off people they’d hired and place graduate students in the position of having to decide whether to pursue their studies without financial support. They said this would negatively affect students seeking mental health care.
If the grants are discontinued, the attorneys general wrote, “grantees in Plaintiff states will be forced to lay off school-based mental health service providers, reducing access to much-needed mental health services to their rural and low-income schools.”
“These grantees will lose qualified mental health service providers; and the benefits of the relationships their students have developed with these providers,” the lawsuit went on. “The spillover effect of students turning to community mental health services — to the extent they are available — will tax Plaintiffs’ already-strained mental health care system.”
Connecticut Democrat Rep. Rosa DeLauro criticized the cuts in recent days. On Monday, along with fellow Connecticut Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, DeLauro introduced a bill that would fund additional mental health workers in schools. 
Kate Dias, President of the Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, praised Tong for taking legal action against the federal government.
“Cutting this funding is not only shortsighted and unjust — it’s reckless. Our kids depend on school-based mental health professionals now more than ever,” she said in a statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6543-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258

(Courtesy of CPW)The head of Colorado Parks and Wildlife told lawmakers on Monday that it is the department’s “preference” to release more wolves into the state next year, despite calls to pause the reintroduction program.
“I don’t have the right answer to whether or not a pause is the right thing to do, or get the last 15 (wolves) out and move on to the management piece,” CPW Director Jeff Davis said. “Every time we release more animals, it’s more emotional and difficult for us to pull off that operation, and it’s also challenging for the (livestock) producers at the same time.”
Davis appeared in front of the Colorado Legislature’s Water Resources and Agriculture Review Committee to give an update on the state’s wolf reintroduction plan, which voters approved in 2020. Wildlife officials have released 25 wolves in the state since December 2023 from Oregon and Canada.
The original goal was to release 10 to 15 per year for three to five years, beginning in 2023, to get to a stable population of at least 50 wolves in the state.

Davis said the department’s preference is to sign a new agreement with British Columbia to relocate more wolves from Canada.
But the program is highly controversial, especially among rural Colorado farmers and ranchers who decry wolves killing their livestock. Between April 2024 and April 2025, wolves killed at least 25 cattle and sheep, according to the recently released annual report on the reintroduction effort.
The Copper Creek pack was responsible for many livestock deaths in Grand County in 2023, prompting to CPW to capture the six wolves last September and release them alongside the Canadian wolves earlier this year in a different part of the state. That decision, producers said Monday, led to an erosion of trust in CPW.
“A depredating pack was known to have depredated in Oregon before they put them in Middle Park. They had a serious impact there. They packaged them up, put them away for a while and then they put them back out right in my backyard,” said Tom Harrington, a cattle producer in Roaring Fork Valley and previous president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association.










I think the entire reintroduction and restoration is at risk if we can't get our legs underneath us and be in a position to do this the way we need to.


– House Speaker Julie McCluskie


A September 2024 petition filed by a coalition of livestock associations and other agricultural interest groups requested a pause in CPW’s planned reintroductions until the department could implement strategies to prevent depredations. CPW’s commission rejected the petition in January.
“I believe that we need no more new releases until plans are in place and the basics are working,” Harrington said Monday. “We need metrics to measure the success of what this program is. I believe we can — and here comes that word that I really don’t like — coexist with the wolves that choose to not prey on our livestock.”
CPW has worked through some of the seven points of the petition, including defining “chronic depredation” as three or more depredations by the same wolf or wolves within 30 days. The division has also outlined a lethal removal approach that starts by killing one or two wolves, evaluating the pack’s behavior and its effect on depredation, then considering additional lethal removals. CPW also started a range rider program to deploy riders in areas with high wolf conflict to “proactively haze predators using non-lethal techniques,” according to the annual report.
CPW killed a wolf for the first time in May in Pitkin County.
“The idea of a pause continues to make sense to me, if it creates more time for more robust implementation and completion of those seven items, and maybe now beyond those seven,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said. “But I think the entire reintroduction and restoration is at risk if we can’t get our legs underneath us and be in a position to do this the way we need to.”
Representatives from CPW also told lawmakers Monday that the cost of the reintroduction has reached about $3 million. In 2020, voters were given an estimate of about $800,000 for the program.
“I understand a lot of this money is going to ranchers and producers to help to compensate them,” Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Frisco Democrat, said. “That’s money hopefully being well spent, but that’s also money in the state of Colorado right now — in the budget situation we’re in — that is not going to fixing potholes in roads. It’s not going to classrooms across the state. It’s not going to people who are losing their health care and many who are about to lose their health care. This seems out of control.”
Davis said there are a lot of factors that go into realizing the reintroduction plan that were not considered in the ballot cost estimate, such as the state’s decision to compensate for livestock weight loss and fewer pregnancies due to wolf presence and the high cost of beef.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A constitutionally created board overseeing nearly $2 billion in public dollars on Tuesday asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to overturn a recent state law saying it threatens its independence.
House Bill 2783, which Gov. Kevin Stitt let become law without his signature, allows the appointing authorities of the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust board to remove members at will. It also limits members of the board to seven years. 
Members currently serve staggered, seven-year terms and are tasked with overseeing the public endowment fund.
“The purpose of having staggered terms is to provide continuity by new appointees joining other board members who have institutional knowledge,” the suit said.
The seven members are appointed by the governor, treasurer, state superintendent, attorney general, state auditor and leaders of the Oklahoma House and Senate.
Each of those officials is named as a defendant in the suit.
The suit asks the high court to put the law, which takes effect Aug. 28, on hold and find it unconstitutional and invalid.
“As I have stated publicly for several months, the Legislature stands ready to work with TSET and our members were genuinely excited about commitments made by them at the start of session to collaborate on projects,” said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow. “Unfortunately, they’ve since decided to change course and now, instead of ever talking to us about their concerns with pending legislation, are going straight to the courts.”
TSET is not a private sector entity, Hilbert said.
“This endowment consists entirely of public funds and as such, the elected members of the Legislature will exercise our authority in overseeing the expenditure of public funds,” Hilbert said.
Lawmakers over the years have unsuccessfully attempted to force TSET to fund various projects, including Medicaid expansion.
Some Democratic lawmakers have said they believe the new law is retaliation and an attempt to strip the board of its independence after TSET declined to immediately provide $50 million for a University of Oklahoma children’s pediatric hospital in Oklahoma City. Lawmakers put $200 million into the project.
Oklahoma voters created TSET, an endowment trust, in 2000 through a constitutional amendment after 46 states sued tobacco companies. The companies paid the states damages for illnesses caused by smoking.
TSET’s Board of Investors invests the funds. The earnings, which have grown to about $2 billion, are used to support efforts to improve health. 
“The intent of voters was to keep politics out of the administration of the TSET trust, which has grown to about $1.9 billion,” said Bob Burke, an attorney representing TSET.
He said TSET uses the fund’s interest to pay for about $80 million annually in grants and programs including the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline, cancer research, and other community efforts to improve health. 
The suit alleges that only a vote of the people can alter the terms board members serve.
“Allowing an Appointing Authority to replace his or her appointment to the board at will violates the plain and unambiguous meaning of the constitutional provision and the voters in approving the amendment,” the suit said.

James Grady speaks to reporters following a joint meeting of the Michigan House Oversight Committee and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Michigan State Police. July 1, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan State Police Director Col. James Grady said Tuesday that a no confidence vote from troopers and command officers didn’t represent the full scope of his department, and that he was working to address issues of low morale that began before his time as the head of the agency.
Grady’s comments came during a joint hearing of the Michigan House Oversight Committee and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Michigan State Police. Some members of the Republican-led House of Representatives and the GOP members of the Senate have called for Grady’s resignation due to complaints from troopers and command officers who have claimed they are fearful of speaking up about department policies under Grady and have faced retaliation when they have.
Grady said that the vote of no confidence from the Michigan State Police Troopers Association and the Michigan State Police Command Officers Association in June was not an MSP-sanctioned survey nor was it reflective of employee surveys issued by the department. Overall, Grady highlighted his years of service to the department and the discretion that comes with his position to make leadership and command changes if needed.
“I’m doing the work, representative,” Grady said in response to questions from Republican state Reps. Mike Mueller and Jay DeBoyer, the respective chairs of the joint committees. “I’m doing everything that I can to ensure that the morale increases, because I, again, respect all of the members of our agency, and I want them to be well. I want them to be in a good place. I want them to want to come to work, because when they’re in a good place, they can come and do the work effectively and efficiently every day. And that’s something that I support as a leader of this department.”

That was how Grady responded to most of the questions lobbed at him from Republicans and Democrats alike on the joint panel, much of which were fastballs and somewhat critical of Grady and his handling of the department. Grady further noted multiple worksite visits, feedback missions and an open door policy as ways he was trying hard to boost morale.
Grady was appointed in Sept. 2023 as director of the department by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, following the departure of former director Joseph Gasper.
Over the last few years, troopers and command officers have complained that Grady was out of line when he came out with a statement that did not initially support former trooper Brian Keely when he was charged in May 2024 in the death of Samuel Sterling. The charges against Keely have since been dropped by a U.S. District Court judge, but the Michigan Department of Attorney General has said it would appeal the dismissal.
Troopers and command officers also took issue with Grady promoting Chief Deputy Director Aimee Brimacombe as his second-in-command because of her alleged lack of experience and multiple complaints made against her before she was elevated several ranks.
Other grievances include Grady’s decision to not keep existing command or leadership staff and replacing them with a new team, which Grady said Tuesday was a means to better serve the department and bring commanders on board with unique strengths.
Troopers filed an ethics complaint against Grady and Brimacombe in January. A handful of troopers also filed lawsuits against Brimacombe questioning her leadership, and questioned performance bonuses Grady and Brimacombe received after only a short time in their roles.
The morass culminated in the vote of no confidence, which Grady said was a first, but later noted that similar questions have been posed to trooper and command officer unions in the past questioning the leadership of previous directors, dating back to 2018.
Some have questioned whether the complaints have an undertone of racial or gender bias, seeing as troopers have in the past complained or sued over the department’s diversity recruitment policies that emerged under Gasper, but before Grady’s ascension to his current role. Although Grady is not the first Black officer to be promoted to colonel, some have called into question the deluge of complaints against the combo of Grady and Brimacombe as the department’s leaders.
That said, DeBoyer, Mueller and others noted that although they have great respect for the department and Grady’s years of service in law enforcement, maybe he wasn’t the right leader for the agency despite his commitment to the department and its troopers.
“I appreciate that, and I don’t have any reason to believe that that is not who you are, but the results of the survey, unfortunately, and with all due respect, says otherwise,” DeBoyer said. “You made the statement that the Michigan State Police is one of the most respected agencies in the entire country, frankly, and it has been for decades. So, when you see that level of lack of confidence, that’s very concerning to us as legislators.”
Mueller, a former law enforcement officer, also said that it appeared to him Grady wasn’t a bad person, but sometimes good people aren’t great leaders.
“It’s not anything about your character at all. It’s about the men and women, 98% of the men and women, that drive around those police cars [who] fear retaliation,” Mueller said.
The gloves were off, however, after that first bit of cordial opening statements.
A “culture of fear”
DeBoyer noted that the House Oversight Committee, which he chairs, has deposed several members of Michigan State Police in the matter of his leadership and had several say that there was a culture of fear in the department for either saying the wrong things, sharing their opinions or speaking up on leadership matters. The depositions, which were not shared in full during the committee nor made public elsewhere, also showed troopers and command officers experienced retaliation for doing so, resulting in work assignment loss or other reprimands.
State Rep. Jamie Greene (R-Richmond) read some of the commentary from MSP’s 2024 employment engagement survey. One response noted that it was allegedly well known within the department that Grady and Brimacombe didn’t take kindly to criticism on their leadership decisions, and if they do, they pay the price.
“This is incredibly disturbing,” Greene added. “This department seems to be fostering a culture of fear and isolation, which is extremely harmful in such a high stress career.”
Greene asked Grady why retaliation was the running theme in some of the responses if he was working to mend bridges and communicating with his troopers about their concerns.
Grady again leaned on his commitment to hearing officers out and said again that he believed those comments did not represent that majority of the department. The director also defended Brimacombe and his decision to elevate her, noting that she has 25 years of experience with the department and a law degree.
Greene asked him if she thought the results of the surveys were fabricated. Grady did not directly respond, but did say there appeared to be copycat or repeated similar responses.
State Rep. Will Snyder (D-Muskegon) said it was his understanding that there were approximately 700 vacant positions within the department and that 500 of them are at the trooper level. Snyder worked that out to be a 20%  vacancy rate, which he said was exceedingly high.
Grady said the department had over the last 10 years hired nearly 1,000 troopers, leading the nation in hiring among state police organizations. He also noted that the department has an aggressive recruiting plan.
Accusations of doxing
But DeBoyer later countered by saying that morale continues to dip and then turned to question Grady about reports of doxing within the department. The names of some of the troopers and command officers who were deposed during recent closed-door hearings of the House Oversight Committee were reported by the Detroit Free Press ahead of Tuesday’s hearing.
DeBoyer said that revelation was appalling, and grilled Grady about how and why someone within the department who was familiar with those discussions leaked that information to the press. The chair as
“That is doxing people within your organization, people who we have asked to communicate with us in private … in fairness and openness and transparency with others members of our committee,” DeBoyer said. “And this morning, in the media, we read three names that only your agency had. That’s inexcusable. … The fact that someone in your agency would dox their own members, Colonel, that is a clear demonstration of why there’s a lack of confidence in leadership at Michigan State Police, because at all costs, they will protect themselves and they will sacrifice their members.”
While DeBoyer called for an investigation, Grady said he wasn’t aware of that leak and would look into it.
Following testimony, Grady spoke to reporters and said he thought the committee hearing was generally unfair and that he was proud of the job that he was doing.
“I’m not the type of Colonel that doesn’t make himself available or accessible. I’ll talk to anybody, and so I have those conversations, and they’re positive,” Grady said of his outreach to troopers. “People enjoy working for the State Police. That’s why, when we do have vacancies, they don’t last long. They don’t remain vacant, because people apply to the positions they want to work here in this department. People want to be state troopers.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250701_104525-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-01 17:07:53.475258

Assembly wants to avert the cut.,"Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin on the Assembly floor on June 30, 2025 (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Another fight is brewing over New Jersey’s already beleaguered public worker health plans.
A provision in the $58.8 billion budget Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Monday night calls for the state or its unions to identify $100 million of savings within the state part of the State Health Benefits Program for the first half of 2026. It spurred alarm among public-sector unions and a promised fix from Assembly Democrats, all of whom are on the ballot this fall.
“It’s clear that there is no immediate need to require state workers to pay more for their health benefits,” said Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden).
New Jersey’s public health plans are in distress amid rising health care costs, spiking prescription drug utilization, frequent deadlocks in Plan Design Committees that set coverage rules, and soaring premiums spurred by — and spurring — municipal departures.
Treasury in May warned local government workers’ public plan was at risk of complete collapse as more and more municipalities with larger, healthier workforces leave for cheaper private options.
The state workers’ plan is shielded from that dynamic because its workers cannot choose private alternatives, but it too faces the threat of more premium increases. In 2024, the state workers’ plan lost roughly $113 million, and it is loaning funds to mitigate costs in the local workers’ plan, which Treasury has said could not repay its debts without a mid-year rate increase in 2025.
Union leaders say hospital pricing is the main driver of growing health benefit costs.
“Until you control the costs, you’re not controlling the dollars. When hospitals are getting paid four to five times as [much as] Medicare for service because they allow the state’s vendors to negotiate in their interests instead of directly negotiating with them,” said Kevin Lyons, executive director of the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association.
Lyons, a member of the State Health Benefits Program’s Plan Design Committee, said New Jersey also could seek to impose caps on the growth of health services.
The state’s actuary in March reported per-visit costs had increased 7% for outpatient services and 12% for outpatient emergency visits in the 12 months preceding October 2024, with similar increases for behavioral health visits, lab work, and primary care appointments. Per-visit costs for urgent care declined by 8% over that period.
Administration officials appear to favor less generous health plans. Plans under the State Health Benefits Program typically cover between 93% and 98% of health care costs. Lowering that number — called an actuarial value — could shave off a significant portion of the state’s health benefit spending, which is expected to total roughly $2.9 billion in fiscal 2026.
Health benefit committees are due to approve rates for the 2026 plan year later this month. The state’s actuaries will make their recommendations public during committee hearings next week.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) in a statement following Monday’s budget vote said legislators last week had learned of an additional $200 million in revenue that could be used to forestall the $100 million cut to the State Health Benefits Program.
“Although I firmly believe New Jersey’s public worker health plans need significant reforms to control costs, the funds allow us the opportunity to find ways to reduce those costs, while treating workers fairly,” Coughlin said, adding his chamber would hold rare hearings July hearings on public worker health benefits.
But it’s not clear what revenue he’s referring to.
A spokesperson for Assembly Democrats initially pointed to revenue growth in taxes on energy sales and the state’s pass-through business alternative income tax, but those figures were unveiled in mid-May. The spokesperson then deferred to Coughlin and Greenwald’s statements, which noted the windfall but made no mention of its source.
Overall revenue projections for the state’s general fund were $247.9 million higher in the budget signed Monday than they were in the budget Murphy presented in February. The budget’s $305 million increase to a $250 million transfer from the state’s Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund Murphy proposed in February more than covers the difference.
Lawmakers have limited ability to use gross income tax and other Property Tax Relief Fund revenues to reduce state worker health benefit costs. The state’s constitution requires those monies be used “exclusively for the purpose of reducing or offsetting property taxes.”
A Treasury spokesperson did not return a request for comment. Spokespeople for the governor did not address the discrepancy.
“Labor and management can work together over the next five months to find real, sustainable health care savings that ultimately help both workers and taxpayers. With public health benefit plans facing astronomical rate increases, all sides must roll up their sleeves to do the hard work necessary to address this problem,” said Natalie Hamilton, a Murphy spokeswoman.
The proposed cut represents about 3.4% the state’s expected spending on its employees’ health benefits in the current July-to-June fiscal year.

Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque), pushed back on the idea that police would be held personally liable for damages under the law. (Photo by Brandon Bell / Getty Images)The organization that represents the vast majority of local police departments in New Mexico on Monday claimed that the state’s civil rights law has been a “complete disaster” for recruiting police.
A New Mexico Municipal League official shared a presentation with lawmakers on Monday that lists “actual or perceived risks” of “liability concerns” stemming from the New Mexico Civil Rights Act as a possible factor contributing to recruitment and retention struggles, along with demoralization; expanded duties; and pay gaps, to name a few other issues attributed to law enforcement agencies.
In passing the New Mexico Civil Rights Act in 2021, New Mexico became one of the first states in the country to abolish qualified immunity — which shields public officials from lawsuits — making it possible for people to sue police officers and others in state court for constitutional rights violations.
On Monday, Municipal League Public Safety Director Tim Johnson told the interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee that the Civil Rights Act, which he referred to by its formal bill number, House Bill 4, has been a “complete disaster” for recruiting police.
“Perception is reality. Some of the legal risks, the debates, the timing, the misinformation during and post-House Bill 4 was a complete disaster for recruiting law enforcement, a complete disaster,” said Johnson, a former State Police chief. “I understand why we did it but again — talk about perception is reality — disastrous for our profession.”
Committee Chair Joseph Cervantes, a Democratic senator from Las Cruces who carried the legislation on the Senate floor in 2021, and Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque), pushed back on the idea that police would be held personally liable for damages under the law.
If juries do award damages to a person alleging civil rights violations, the law does not make police officers personally financially liable, Cervantes said. That responsibility lies with the government agencies that employ them, he said.
Moreover, Cervantes contended the false perception held by police stems from a misinformation campaign.
“Law enforcement were lied to, and they’re still being lied to, and that’s why it’s disastrous, because they’re being told that the bill exposes them to personal liability,” Cervantes told Johnson. “I sat there and watched the Association of Counties and the Municipal League — who you work for now — and others, suggest to law enforcement that this bill was going to expose them to personal liability and that’s just not true.”
“It was an attempt to defeat the bill, let’s be honest,” Cervantes added.
Maestas said if polled, the vast majority of New Mexico police officers and sheriff’s deputies would wrongly think “that they’re in jeopardy of having to pay out in a lawsuit…They literally think that, and you could tell them straight in the eye, and they would not believe you,” Maestas said.
While Johnson repeatedly told the committee on Monday that “perception is reality,” Cervantes responded by saying the Municipal League is in the best position to change the wrong perception about the Civil Rights Act.
Johnson responded by saying he will do that, “and I would ask you to try to make them feel safe that it’ll never happen.”

Mike DeWine on Monday vetoed it, saying that lawmakers in the Ohio House and Senate asked him to.
In his veto message, DeWine acknowledged that Ohio pharmacies are closing rapidly, and said he and Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel will keep working on the problem.
Last year, Ohio lost 215 pharmacies and the total number dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory, according to an online tracker launched by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. Pharmacy owners have long complained that huge pharmacy middlemen with conflicted interests have used a non-transparent system to underpay them and drive them out of business. 
In response, legislation was introduced in the Ohio House earlier this year that would require the middlemen to reimburse pharmacies for drugs based on a public database compiled by the federal government. 
That would only allow pharmacies to break even on drugs. So the legislation also required the middlemen to pay a $10 per-prescription dispensing fee to cover pharmacies’ overhead such as payroll, rent, taxes, and insurance. It’s based on a statewide survey regularly conducted among pharmacies.
Then the Ohio Chamber of Commerce got involved, telling state senators that the dispensing fees were a tax and that they should oppose them. The chamber made that claim even though the Ohio Department of Medicaid in 2022 adopted a similar system and saved $140 million in the process.
Despite requests, the Ohio Chamber hasn’t disclosed how much money it gets from the middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. The company that owns the biggest PBM, CVS Health, was a “presenting sponsor”  of the Chamber’s 2024 Healthcare Summit, and an executive with the company delivered a keynote speech. 
The Ohio Senate attempted a compromise between the House legislation and the Ohio Chamber’s demand for no dispensing fees. It would have required PBMs to reimburse pharmacies in a transparent system, but it would have eliminated minimum dispensing fees.
The Ohio Pharmacists Association said that would be much worse for pharmacies than the current, inadequate setup. Pharmacies could only break even on their drugs, and they couldn’t recoup their overhead, they said.
“It’s any pharmacist’s suicide bill,” Dave Burke, the organization’s executive director, said last week.

In vetoing it, DeWine agreed.
“This item was intended to strike a compromise between interested parties on how to best regulate the practice of pharmacy benefit managers in Ohio and the requirements for fair and transparent reimbursement for Ohio pharmacies,” the governor’s veto message said. “However, due to drafting errors, the language will not achieve the legislative intent of providing the needed oversight of pharmacy benefit manager practices. Subsequently, the language as written, may result in further detriment to Ohio pharmacies, especially those in small, rural communities, and could result in a reduction in health care access for many Ohioans.”
The message explained that those who wrote the legislation into the state budget asked that it be pulled back.
“Due to the errors in drafting final language, the Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate have requested this veto,” DeWine’s veto message said. “Therefore, a veto of this item is in the public interest.”
In an interview Tuesday, Burke said he didn’t think there was any ill intent on the part his former colleagues in the Ohio Senate.
“I think people are getting misinformation from the PBMs, who are trying to maintain their foothold and prevent a free and transparent market,” he said.
Burke also said he didn’t believe the Ohio Chamber was selling out its Ohio membership in favor of out-of-state, Fortune 15 health conglomerates that own the big-three PBMs.
“I don’t think the Ohio Chamber is anti-pharmacy,” said Burke, who is himself a pharmacist. “I think they just don’t understand how their benefits are actually being administered.”
But he added that every business in Ohio has an interest in a healthy network of pharmacies.
“I don’t know what they’re going to do when their employees can’t get their prescription drugs where they live,” Burke said. “That’s happening now in real time. We have pharmacy deserts and they’re getting worse every year.”
Denise Conway, who in 2019 restored pharmacy services in Danville, said the veto is far from enough to solve the problems besetting Ohio pharmacies.
“It is a slight win for pharmacies across Ohio and I am grateful for the governor’s vision to see that things aren’t being addressed,” she said in a text message Tuesday.
In his veto message, DeWine said more needs to be done.
“It is important to note that the DeWine-Tressel Administration is committed to further reforms of pharmacy benefit managers, as already demonstrated in improvements made in Ohio’s Medicaid program through the adoption of the Single Pharmacy Benefit Manager,” it said, referring to the measure that saved taxpayers $140 million. “This administration is committed to working with the Ohio General Assembly in the future to deliver a pharmacy-benefit-manager regulatory bill.” 
Burke said that he might be partly to blame for the PBM-aligned position taken by the Ohio Chamber.
“I have to think, knowing (Senior Vice President) Rick Carfagna and (President and CEO) Steve Stivers, that they’re not ignorant and they’re not bought and paid for,” Burke said. “They’re intelligent people. Maybe it’s my fault for not stopping by and sitting down with them.”
He added that he’s ready to work with the Ohio Chamber or anybody else to shore up Ohio’s dwindling network of pharmacies.
“We’re in a bad place,” Burke said. The Ohio Pharmacists Association “definitely has an open hand and an open mind for anyone who’s willing to work with us on this issue. But we are running out of time.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)A former Boise Democratic legislator on Sunday stepped down from his role in the Statehouse to run for the U.S. Senate as an independent against longtime Idaho U.S. Sen. Jim Risch.
Todd Achilles, who was appointed to fill a District 16 position and won the November 2024 election for the Idaho House, said he became an “unaffiliated voter” over the weekend because he is increasingly frustrated by both parties.
“It begins with the fact that the two-party system is just fundamentally broken right now in the United States,” Achilles told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
He cited the increased federal debt, deficit and involvement in overseas conflicts as some of the reasons he did not want to run as a member of either of the two major parties.

Achilles will challenge Risch, who has served as one of Idaho’s two U.S. senators since 2009. Risch will be up for reelection in November 2026 and announced in April that he plans to run again. He was endorsed by President Donald Trump.
“It’s a great time for America,” Risch said in a press release. “I want to continue working with President Trump to get government out of the way.”
Achilles told the Capital Sun that he believed Idaho voters — who have not elected a non-Republican U.S. senator since Democrat Frank Church in 1974 — will be receptive to an independent candidate.
“People are tired of a system that is more and more divisive,” he said.
 Idaho Democratic Party will submit three potential candidates for governor to choose from to fill vacancy

Because Achilles stepped down before the end of his term in the Idaho House, the Idaho Democratic Party will select from applicants three potential candidates for Gov. Brad Little to choose from.
Little will make the appointment by July 14, according to a statement from the Idaho Democratic Party.

It will become illegal next month to use a phone while driving in Louisiana unless it’s for hands-free calls or navigation.
On Monday, Gov. Jeff Landry signed House Bill 519 by Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, that bans most cellphone and other wireless communication use while operating a motor vehicle.
The new law prohibits phone use during driving except for voice calls on hands-free systems, including wrist-worn devices such as the Apple Watch, and looking at a hands-free navigation system.
The hands-free exception doesn’t permit all usage of a cellphone while driving. The law still prohibits most texting and emailing even when the phone is paired to a remote system. It outlaws driving while “accessing, reading, viewing, composing, browsing, transmitting, saving, or retrieving electronic data” from any phone app unless it’s for voice calls or navigation.
In a phone call Tuesday, Glorioso said the intent of the law is to prohibit phone use whenever it creates a distraction and requires looking away from the road.
The ban doesn’t apply to the use of a phone when the vehicle is stationary or when making calls to report traffic collisions or emergencies. It also contains exceptions for emergency officials, first responders and certain professional drivers who use radios or communication devices affixed to their vehicles.
Gov. Landry taunts Republican senator at bill signing event

The law takes effect on Aug. 1 and is part of the Louisiana Legislature’s effort to tackle the high cost of auto insurance in the state. Studies have shown that cell phone use while driving significantly increases the risk of an accident, which could drive up insurance rates.
Before this year’s legislative session, lawmakers had tried repeatedly to enact similar laws but always came up short due in part to concerns that police officers might use the phone ban as an excuse to perform traffic stops and vehicle searches. But lawmakers settled on a compromise that added a provision to prevent officers from conducting searches or making arrests based solely on a cell phone use violation.
“Finally, this year we were able to pass a distracted driving bill,” Landry said before signing the bill Monday.
Violations of the new phone ban can fetch a fine of up to $100 or up to $250 if the offense occurs in a school or highway construction zone. However, those fines will not take effect until Jan. 1, 2026. Until that time, violators will receive a warning.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)This story originally appeared on Tennessee Lookout. 
NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s two Republican U.S. senators — Rick Scott and Ashley Moody — voted in support on Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s signature tax break and spending cuts legislation, which needed Vice President J.D. Vance’s vote to pass, 51-50.
Both lawmakers celebrated passage of the bill, but Scott didn’t deny the measure as written does nothing to address the growing federal deficit. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a calculation Sunday showing the bill would add $3.25 trillion to deficits over 10 years.
“In this bill, there are many spending projects you will be surprised to see with our nation more than $37 trillion in debt. I was, too,” Scott acknowledged in a written statement released following the vote.
“But, that is the imperfect process of bringing elected individuals together to pass a bill that works for their states. I have been warning my colleagues for years about the dangers of massive deficit spending and debt for the American people, and we have our work cut out for us to ensure Congress fully understands this.”
“This bill delivers the LARGEST tax cut for the working and middle class in history,” Moody said in a press release.
“This is just the beginning, and with President Donald Trump, we will not stop pushing forward, around the clock, to deliver wins for the American people. There is a lot of work to get done so that our country returns to financial freedom, but together, we will restore policies that ensure Florida is stronger and safer than ever before.”
Moody added that passage of the bill puts “an end to the Biden-era madness.”
The measure now moves back to the U.S. House of Representatives. Among Florida’s 20 members in the House, eight issued a statement on Monday indicating they support the measure. The bill is opposed by all eight Florida House Democrats.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Digital driver’s licenses are one step closer to being filed in New Jerseyans’ virtual wallets under a bill the Legislature advanced Monday with overwhelming approval. 
The proposal is one Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled during his final State of the State address in January. At the time, he called it “common sense” and said it would “make life easier for people we serve.” 
But the bill — which now sits on the governor’s desk awaiting his signature — wouldn’t take effect for more than three years. It’s also likely the state would have to apply for a waiver for mobile versions under Real ID requirements, which began in May. 
The state Motor Vehicle Commission would be able to charge a “reasonable” fee for issuing mobile driver’s licenses or non-driver identification cards.
Thirteen states already offer mobile driver’s licenses, including Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and neighboring states like New York and Delaware. Some states’ mobile licenses can be used at certain airports and federal agencies, according to the Transportation Security Administration. 
The bill also states that if someone hands off their phone to show their ID, that doesn’t constitute consent to search their phone or access information that isn’t on their identification card. It also requires the commission to equip the digital IDs with certain features to ensure “security and integrity” of the documentation to protect people’s personal information. 
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators called mobile driver’s licenses the “future of licensing and proof of identity.” They’re a significant improvement over physical IDs, which can be lost, stolen, broken or damaged, outdated, and easily replicated for counterfeiting, the organization said.
A spokesman for the Motor Vehicle Commission did not respond to a request for comment.
The bill passed the Assembly with a vote of 75-3, with two abstentions. In the Senate, it passed 31-6. The no votes were all Republicans.

The charges were part of a national investigation billed as the largest in history. All told, 324 people across the country were charged with submitting false billing statements amounting to more than $14.6 billion and diverting more than 15 million pills containing controlled substances, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
The alleged schemes in South Carolina involved falsified reimbursement claims that in some cases originated in other states but targeted the Palmetto State’s Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, according to a news release.
“Health care fraud steals from the American taxpayer and harms the systems meant to serve those in need,” said Bryan Stirling, acting U.S. attorney in South Carolina. “The cases in South Carolina, like those nationwide, demonstrate our unwavering commitment to protecting vulnerable citizens, especially our veterans, and ensuring the integrity of programs designed to care for them.”
Two of the cases will be litigated in South Carolina’s federal court. Eight cases involving the Palmetto State will go through the Western District of North Carolina because the scheme took place primarily in Charlotte. One was filed in South Carolina state court, according to a list of cases nationwide.
A $21 million scheme
Between 2017 and 2024, eight people established nine fake behavioral health clinics in North Carolina and enrolled them in South Carolina’s Medicaid program through a program that allows people using Medicaid to visit doctors within 25 miles of the state line, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.


Defendants involving South Carolina
Charged in the Western District of North Carolina

Donald Calvin Saunders, 62, of Charlotte, North Carolina
Vanessa Ragin Boatright, 59, of Manning
Latarsa Hitchcock, 56, of Raleigh, North Carolina
Dajuan Strickland, 46, of Buffalo, New York, and Charlotte, North Carolina
Cynthia Jenkins Harris, 60, of Elgin
Stephanie Corbett, 59, of Jonesboro, Georgia
Karen McClary, 51, of Kingstree

Charged in the District of South Carolina

Tina Marie Armstrong, 67, of Florence
Dee Alice Moton, 51, of Hephzibah, Georgia

State charges

Latisha Alexandria Massey, 37, of Greer



Three of the people charged lived in South Carolina. Others lived in North Carolina and Georgia, according to the office.
Once the businesses were enrolled in the Medicaid program, the defendants would obtain real names and identification numbers of licensed medical professionals.
Most of the medical professionals whose names and identification numbers were used didn’t know about the scheme. The people running the clinics would get their information from job applications for the fake clinics and by hiring them to review clinical notes — a task that doesn’t require actually meeting with patients, according to the indictment.
The patients supposedly coming to the clinics for treatment were sometimes real and sometimes fake. None of the real patients actually came to the clinics, but the owners paid people with legitimate access to the state’s Medicaid rolls between $200 and $300 per name provided, using about 180 real names in total, according to court filings.
Using those names and identification numbers, the owners of the fake clinics would submit false reimbursement requests for services not actually performed. In some cases, the services couldn’t possibly have happened, since they added up to more than 24 hours of service per day for a single health care provider or covered dates from before a person was deemed eligible for Medicaid, according to the indictment.
Altogether, the fake clinics in North Carolina received more than $21 million in reimbursements from South Carolina’s Medicaid program for services not actually performed, according to the indictment. The conspirators then transferred that money from bank account to bank account in a way that constituted money laundering, the U.S. Attorney’s Office claimed.
One of the defendants in the scheme, North Carolina resident David Hill, has agreed to plead guilty, according to the state Attorney General’s Office.
Services to veterans
As an approved health care provider under the federal Veterans Affairs department, Dee Moton’s massage therapy company Flowing Hands, located in Aiken, was allowed to provide certain health care services to veterans who received referrals.
What Moton, a 51-year-old from Georgia, submitted to the company with which she contracted, however, did not align with the services she provided, leading to charges of health care fraud, according to a federal indictment.
Many of her submissions for reimbursements involved mutually exclusive reimbursement codes. Others were for services she couldn’t have performed, such as wheelchair therapy to patients who did not use wheelchairs, aquatic therapy despite the clinic not having a pool, and remote monitoring of pacemakers for patients who didn’t have pacemakers, according to the indictment.
Over two years, Moton billed the Veterans Administration for more than $2.3 million for services she didn’t actually perform, claimed the state’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, which will prosecute the case.
It’s unclear who is representing Moton, who could not be immediately reached for comment.
False equipment claims
Tina Armstrong, a 67-year-old woman from Florence, was charged with submitting nearly $200,000 to the state’s Medicaid and Medicare programs for medical equipment that was no longer in use, never authorized or not delivered, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Armstrong pleaded not guilty, according to court filings.
An indictment listing her charges claimed she received about $105,000 from the claims.
Under the company Safe at Home Medical Equipment and Supplies, located in Dillon County, Armstrong submitted claims for equipment for patients who had died or didn’t use the equipment she claimed they needed and asked for reimbursements for monthly rentals long after the time limits established in federal law had passed, according to the indictment.
Financial fraud
Latisha Massey, a 37-year-old certified nursing assistant, was charged in state court with financial crimes involving the nursing home where she worked, according to an indictment.
The Greer resident transferred funds from the bank account of an adult in her care to her own account and used a card belonging to a resident of the facility where she worked, according to the indictment.
The indictment did not include the amounts Massey is charged with transferring. The state Attorney General’s Office will prosecute her case because — unlike the others — the alleged crimes do not cross state lines.
A message on a phone believed to be Massey’s was not immediately returned.

The transformation is far from guaranteed. Lawmakers first need to agree on a new school district map before proceeding with other facets of the law.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Gov. Phil Scott has signed Vermont’s education bill into law. Here’s what happens next..","Gov. Phil Scott on Tuesday signed a landmark education reform bill into law, laying the groundwork for a historic transformation of Vermont’s public education system.
“While this session was long and difficult and uncomfortable for some, we were able to come together and chart a path towards a system that better serves our kids and one that taxpayers can afford,” Scott said, surrounded by top legislative leaders and other dignitaries, before signing the bill.
He noted, however, that the legislation was “just the beginning,” and work to continue public education reform in future legislative sessions “will be just as difficult and just as important as what we did this spring.”

The signing marks a significant political milestone for the Republican governor, now in his fifth term, who used electoral gains in the state’s Republican Party in November to set the tone for education reform. While the ambitious plan that Education Secretary Zoie Saunders set before lawmakers in January was not adopted wholecloth, what came to Scott’s desk contained similar elements.
Over months of contentious debate this session inside committee rooms and both chambers, Scott put pressure on the Legislature’s Democratic leaders to press on with reforms he wanted, even through deep disagreement within their own caucus.
But lawmakers at the signing lauded what they called a bipartisan achievement. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, said the legislation that emerged “was a substantially bipartisan bill.” House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, called it the “most significant education transformation” in decades. And Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, said the bill will “ensure that every Vermont student will have access to high quality public education regardless of where they live.”
The law comes as the state’s public education system faces declining enrollment. The bill states that over the last three decades, the number of students being educated in the public school system has dropped by almost a quarter, from around 110,000 students to approximately 84,000 students.

“Many schools have lost a significant number of students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at every school,” the bill’s preamble reads. “Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future.”
Lawmakers went into overtime to get a bill passed this session at Scott’s insistence, working weeks past the Legislature’s typical end date to get the bill over the finish line. The governor went so far as to tell lawmakers that if they adjourned without a major overhaul bill, he would use his emergency power to call them back into session.
Votes in the Senate and House were far from unanimous. Most of the Senate’s Democratic caucus members voted against its passing. The bill then passed the House via a controversial voice vote.
Broadly, the new law tries to achieve two goals: equalize educational opportunities across the state, and, over time, make public education more affordable for taxpayers.
Supporters of the legislation have said the law’s changes will slow the rise of education costs and stabilize property tax increases, which were exacerbated in 2024 by changes to the current education finance system and the transition mechanism for them that the Legislature put in place.
But, as the governor noted, the wide-ranging reforms laid out in the bill are far from guaranteed, and the work is hardly over.

“There’s so much work to do that I can’t even see the finish line,” Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said at the signing ceremony on Tuesday.
The law contains several caveats and contingencies, and will require years of work by state agencies — particularly the Agency of Education and the Department of Taxes — and various advisory committees and working groups before the transition is complete.
Specifically, several dominos need to fall before the Legislature can enact a new education funding formula, which itself will be phased in over a five-year period and, like many of the biggest reforms, would not begin to go into effect until 2028 or beyond.
However, right away, the law puts limits on Vermont’s longstanding practice of public school districts paying tuition to send students to private schools (called independent schools in Vermont law). Starting July 1, out-of-state private schools will no longer be eligible to receive public tuition for new students. Public schools in other states will remain an option. 
Private schools located in the state will have to meet two tests to maintain their participation. First, they must be physically located in a school district or in a supervisory union — an administrative unit made up of multiple districts — where at least one district does not operate a public school for some or all grades as of last July. 
Second, they will need to have at least 25% of the student body composed of students funded by a public school district during the 2023-24 school year. 
A spokesperson for the Agency of Education said the state is working to validate enrollment data for these schools, and has set a July 28 deadline for independent schools to certify their enrollment.
“Once we have those numbers validated, we will have a clearer picture of how many schools will no longer be eligible to receive public tuition,” said Lindsey Hodges, an agency spokesperson.
A transition written into the law requires public school districts to continue paying for current students, or students who have already been accepted through graduation.
Now, the next step for a select group of lawmakers is to craft the proposed boundaries of new, larger school districts. Their colleagues must then approve a proposal next year, sure to be a contentious undertaking. 
“At the end of the day, we will have another vote next year to continue this effort, so people will have a chance to speak with their representatives, and the entire process will begin over again,” Baruth said Tuesday.
If lawmakers cannot come to an agreement on those maps, the rest of the law’s provisions likely won’t see the light of day.
Here’s what will happen next now that Scott has signed H.454 into law.
Redistricting
The next step for lawmakers is to adopt a new configuration of school districts by consolidating the state’s 119 school districts — contained within the 52 supervisory districts or supervisory unions.
The School District Redistricting Task Force, expected to meet “on or before” Aug. 1 this year, will work on “not more than three” options for new school district boundaries, according to the law.
The task force will have 11 members, including six lawmakers and five former superintendents and school business managers, according to the law. To compose the six lawmakers, three will be nominated by the leadership of each chamber and cannot all be from the same party nor same school district. Of the five others, two each will be nominated by leaders of the Senate and the House, with one nominated by the governor. 
The group is expected to bring back plans with anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts. At least one of those options will incorporate the supervisory unions and supervisory district structure, which advocates believe are required to allow for the continuation of historic tuitioning relationships between certain independent schools and specific geographic areas without an operating public school for at least some grades.
These new larger districts would oversee a minimum of 4,000 prekindergarten through grade 12 students, but no more than 8,000 students “to the extent practical,” according to the law.
That directive is likely to bring major upheaval to Vermont’s public schools. Currently, only the Champlain Valley School District in Chittenden County has more than 4,000 students, with other larger districts, like Burlington and Essex-Westford in Chittenden County, hovering around 3,500 students.
The new law mandates that the task force “work closely” with the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont, created as part of 2024’s Act 183 to study Vermont’s public education system.
The commission is tasked with conducting public outreach sessions, and making recommendations to the Legislature about what roles and powers should remain at the local school district level versus what should be moved up to the state level.
Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders testifies before the House Education Committee at the Statehouse on Feb. 4. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
But that commission has floundered since January, when Scott and Saunders released their education proposal. And last week, two members of the commission resigned, saying in emails to colleagues that the commission was “never fully embraced” by the Legislature.
The commission will submit its final report in December, and will then dissolve by the end of the year.
The redistricting task force, meanwhile, is expected to finalize and deliver new school district maps to the Legislature by Dec. 1. Lawmakers will then take up the new maps for consideration during next year’s session, which begins in January. 
Because of the time needed to create representative voting districts for school boards within the new districts, their boundaries would need to be approved and signed into law before the end of the year for the rest of the timeline to remain viable. 
Class size minimums
Under the law, at least 10 students per classroom would be required in first grade, 12 students in grades 2 through 5, 15 in grades 6 through 8; and 18 students for grades 9 through 12. These class size minimums would take effect in July 2026 for the 2026-27 school year and would apply to both public schools and private schools that receive tuition from public school districts.
Some classes and programs would be exempt from those requirements, including prekindergarten and kindergarten, as well as Advanced Placement courses and career and technical education programs, according to the law.
The law allows the State Board of Education to close a school that doesn’t meet these minimums after three years, but the board isn’t required to do that, and the bill allows for a waiver process that would let schools petition for an exemption.
The law does anticipate that small rural schools will continue to exist and reserves some support for them. By Dec. 1, the State Board of Education, per the law, will submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on Education with proposed standards for schools to be deemed “small by necessity” or “sparse by necessity.” 
Districts with schools meeting those definitions would be eligible for additional support funds.
New school board elections
While the redistricting task force begins its work, the School District Voting Ward Working Group, set to first meet by Oct. 1, will keep an eye on its progress. The law requires the group to consult with the task force by Oct. 15.
That working group will begin creating voting wards for the new districts as soon as possible, depending on what’s been accomplished.
Chaired by the secretary of state, the group, like the redistricting task force, will make recommendations to the Legislature for how to draw voting districts within each new school district “that are compact, contiguous, and drawn to achieve substantially equal weighting of votes” while meeting other state and federal requirements.
The group will recommend to the Legislature the “optimal” number of members on each new board, as well as the boundaries for voting wards within each new school district.
The first school board elections for the new districts are expected to take place in a special election in November 2027, according to the law. The new school districts, with their new board members, would then take over operating schools in July 2028 for the 2028-29 school year.

The law provides staffing and resources to the Agency of Education and State Board of Education to help guide current school districts as they transition their operations to the newly formed districts. That will involve a myriad of legal and administrative tasks, ranging from a new district adopting shared rules and procedures to taking over a former district’s debt obligations.
Prior to the transfer of school operations, the law will also attempt to address one of the more significant expenses affecting local school districts: aging school infrastructure and its cost to repair or replace.
The law creates the State Aid for School Construction Advisory Board, expected to meet in September of this year, to advise the Agency of Education and both current and new school districts on state financial assistance with construction.
That board would work to develop rules for accessing the School Construction Aid Special Fund, which the Agency of Education will administer once the fund is created on July 1, 2026. That fall, the law anticipates that the agency’s budget request will include the fund’s expected spending. 
Education finance
One of the more contentious issues the bill hopes to address is how to allocate funding for public education in the state.
The new law has the state gradually pivoting away from its current funding mechanism — which allows school districts wide latitude in determining how much to spend or not spend — toward a so-called foundation formula, a construct used in most states across the country.  A foundation formula will provide each school district with the same amount per student, weighted to account for the increased costs of educating certain students, such as English learners and students with disabilities. 
Effectively, while school district governing boards would likely still set a budget, the foundation formula would largely give the state control over the size of that budget, and how much the district spends on each type of student.
Full implementation of the new funding formula, however, will not occur for some time. If new school districts are adopted and specific studies completed, the foundation formula would go online July 1, 2028, and would be phased in over a five-year period.
Local districts could raise additional funds from local property taxpayers with voter approval. But that spending, termed supplemental spending, would start out capped at just 10%, though districts can spend less. That cap would be ratcheted down every year until the cap hits 5%. 
The first opportunity voters would have to weigh in on that supplemental spending would be in March 2028. 
Phase in
Under the law’s timeline, the commissioner of taxes would call the first meeting of the Education Fund Advisory Committee in July 2026 to assist in the “transformation” of Vermont’s education finance system. Recommendations on specifics related to the mechanics would then be due in December of that year.
The Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Office would have already found one or more contractors with “expertise in Vermont’s education funding system” to study a number of portions of the new formula and submit a report due in December 2026.
During this phase-in period, the Vermont Department of Taxes is tasked with leading a shift in the state’s mechanism for income-sensitive property tax relief, moving from one based on tax credits to a tax exemption.
The new framework allows Vermonters making $115,000 or less to exempt a portion of the value of their homestead, which is a dwelling occupied year round and up to two surrounding acres, from property taxes.

The exemption creates a sliding scale, with lower-income homeowners eligible for bigger exemptions. Up to $425,000 in home value is eligible for the discount. The law suggests there will be a mechanism for the income threshold and property value threshold to be increased in the future to account for inflation, requiring reports from the department on how to do it.
By Dec. 15, 2026, the tax department, in consultation with the Joint Fiscal Office, will submit a proposal to legislative committees in both chambers on how to design a homestead exemption structure that minimizes the property tax impacts for homestead property owners and avoids a sudden dropoff in eligibility often called “benefit cliffs.”
By the same time the following year, Dec. 15, 2027, the department, in consultation with the Joint Fiscal Office and the Agency of Education, will report to House and Senate lawmakers on an implementation plan “to ensure that education property tax rates do not increase as part of the transition.”
Separate rate for second homes
Perhaps the most uncertain portion of the law is a proposal to rework how second homes are taxed in the state.
The law creates two new categories of property for taxation purposes. One is called “non-homestead residential” property. Lawmakers hope to use this new classification to raise taxes on second homes, which would potentially cover the cost of the homestead exemptions or otherwise alleviate property tax pressure on Vermont resident homeowners. Another new category of “nonhomestead nonresidential” would apply to other properties.
The tax department is tasked with reporting by Dec. 15 of this year on how the new property tax classifications would be implemented. In 2027, the department would need to develop a form that allows property owners to report how their property fits into the classifications. 
However, the new classifications would also be repealed if the Legislature has not approved a new school district map by Jan. 1, 2027. Another deadline is July 1, 2028. By then, lawmakers need to have assigned different tax rate multipliers to the new categories of property or they also go away.

Ron DeSantis met on Tuesday, July 1, at the state's new deportation facility in the middle of the Everglades. (Via governor's X feed)President Donald Trump urged additional states to build immigrant detention centers following his tour Tuesday of the 3,000-capacity tent and trailer Everglades facility the DeSantis administration built in eight days.
The president took the opportunity to press Congress on his giant tax and spending cuts package, saying its passage is necessary to heightened federal immigration enforcement. The Senate passed the megabill with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance during Trump’s appearance in the Everglades, and the Trump administration expects its final passage before Independence Day.
Continuing the DeSantis administration’s portrayal of the controversial detention center as inescapable, Trump applauded the location at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport.
“It’s known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is very appropriate because I looked outside, and that’s not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon but, very soon, this facility will house some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet,” Trump said. “We’re surrounded by miles of treacherous swamp land, and the only way out is really deportation.”
Another detention center to come
During a roundtable discussion at the facility, DeSantis described the detention center as a “one-stop shop” with a runway that will allow the federal government to carry out deportation flights. The governor used a state of emergency declaration he issued in January 2023 to take over and begin the speedy construction on the land Miami-Dade County owns.
A similar center with the capacity to house 2,000 immigrants is set to open in Camp Blanding in Northeast Florida, the primary training center for the Florida National Guard, after July 4, said Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Photographs and videos of the Everglades detention center show metal mesh cages with bed bunks and toilets under a tent that Guthrie described as having an aluminium frame that can withstand winds of 110 miles an hour. Hurricane season opened on June 1.
“Why would you want to come through Alligator Alcatraz, if you can just go home on your own?” DeSantis said. “I think a lot of people are going to make that decision. So you’re going to have a lot of deportations that are going to be done by the administration, but I think you’re going to have a lot of voluntary, as well. So this is a force multiplier for the president’s efforts.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Protests and praise from Trump
So far in the Trump’s quest to enact mass deportations — a move DeSantis has sought for the state to take a lead on with partnerships between state and local law enforcement and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — 71.2% of immigrants detained have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse out of Syracuse University.
In protest, the Miami-Dade Democratic Hispanic Caucus placed a truck billboard on the nearby Tamiami Trail calling Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and South Florida’s Latino Republicans in Congress traitors to immigrants.
“Trump and DeSantis are locking up immigrants under inhumane conditions without even granting them due process. A detention camp without due process is a concentration camp. We will not just accept a concentration camp in our backyard,” said Abel Delgado, president of the Miami-Dade Democratic Hispanic Caucus, in a press release. “We support all legal and political efforts to block this abhorrent violation of basic human rights. We will continue our efforts to protect immigrants and protect the American Dream.”
  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier via Department of Legal Affairs
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier received nods and praise from Trump during the roundtable.
Uthmeier, whom DeSantis appointed as the state’s chief legal officer in February after serving as the governor’s chief of staff, publicly announced the plan for the Everglades detention center on Fox News on June 18.
“You do a very good job. I hear good things,” Trump said. “I hear good things about you from Ron, too. No, you really do. He’s even a good-looking guy. That guy’s got a future, huh?”
A federal judge out of the Southern District of Florida found Uthmeier in civil contempt on June 17 over his disobedience of an order blocking a new state immigration law.
Trump told Uthmeier he should consider the backlash against the detention center from environmental groups as an honor. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a suit Friday seeking to temporarily halt the opening of the detention center. However, the judge assigned to the case, Eduardo Sanchez, recused himself on Monday evening, delaying the proceedings.
In a filing opposing the halting of the detention center on Monday, Guthrie argued that the additional capacity is necessary because of overcrowding in ICE detention centers. Five people have died in ICE custody in Florida this year. Isidro Pérez, a 75-year-old from Cuba who had been in the United States for decades, was the latest person to die under detention at Krome Service Processing Center in Miami, on June 26, according to a press release from ICE.
Others with whom DeSantis has had an icy relationship in recent months also attended the president’s tour: Congressman Byron Donalds, running to succeed DeSantis; Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson; Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez; and Sarasota Republican Sen. Joe Gruters.
Kristi Noem, Department of Homeland Security secretary, and Stephen Miller, White House Deputy Chief of Staff, also attended.

Pueblo Action Alliance is one of fifteen plaintiffs appealing a civil lawsuit to the New Mexico Supreme Court alleging the state government failed to regulate oil and gas pollution, claiming it violates resident's constitutional rights. Indigenous and youth plaintiffs on Tuesday said they will ask New Mexico’s highest court to weigh in on a lawsuit alleging state officials failed to protect communities from oil and gas pollution and violated residents’ constitutional rights.
The suit was originally filed on behalf of environmental groups, youth activists and individuals from the Pueblos, the Permian Basin and Navajo Nation against Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, cabinet secretaries at the environment and energy departments, along with the Legislature and rule making bodies for the oil and gas industry.
On Tuesday, attorneys and plaintiffs announced the appeal of a June ruling by a panel of appellate judges, which overturned a lower court’s ruling that the case could partially proceed and ordered the case’s dismissal.
“From our position, the state has not yet addressed the harm that has been imposed on the plaintiff groups and we don’t agree with the court’s decision to dismiss our case,” said plaintiff Julia Bernal, the executive director of Pueblo Action Alliance in a virtual news conference Friday.
The complaint alleges the state government failed to adequately enforce pollution laws on oil and gas, harming nearby communities, Indigenous people and New Mexico youth, which plaintiffs argue is a violation of a 1971 amendment to the state Constitution called the Pollution Control Clause.
That section of the New Mexico Constitution states: “The protection of the state’s beautiful and healthful environment is hereby declared to be of fundamental importance to the public interest, health, safety and the general welfare. The legislature shall provide for control of pollution and control of despoilment of the air, water and other natural resources of this state, consistent with the use and development of these resources for the maximum benefit of the people.”
Plaintiffs want more consideration of the constitutional issue, said Feleecia Guillen, a plaintiff representing the nonprofit Youth United for Climate Crisis Action (YUCCA).
“This appeal is our demand that the courts do their job, to uphold the law and defend our rights,” Guillen said. “The Pollution Control Clause isn’t symbolic: It’s a promise, and it’s time that the state was held accountable to that promise.”
The state has a chance to respond to the new filing before the New Mexico Supreme Court and justices will determine if the case will move forward.
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a Source NM request for comment on Tuesday afternoon.

Maria Cantwell led a successful push Tuesday to eliminate a proposal inside Republicans’ massive budget bill to dissuade states from regulating artificial intelligence.
The 99-1 vote against the AI provision was a rare bipartisan victory as Republicans steered the megabill across the finish line in the U.S. Senate. The overall legislation will still require House approval before it can be signed into law. In Washington state, existing laws prohibiting deepfakes in political campaigns and fabricated sexual images without consent could have been at risk if Congress moved forward with the restrictions on regulating artificial intelligence.
Other concerns range from replicating a musician’s voice without their permission to protections for children online.
The proposal evolved from a straightforward 10-year ban on state regulation of AI, to tying that ban to billions in federal funding for broadband internet access. States could’ve lost the money if they proceeded with artificial intelligence regulations. Washington stands to receive $1.2 billion from the broadband program, but new guidance from the Trump administration has also thrown state officials for a loop.
In the face of strident opposition from Republican and Democratic leaders at the state and federal levels, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other Senate Republicans reduced the ban to five years and exempted some statutes in an effort to salvage some version of it. 
Cruz had said President Donald Trump backed the compromise. Proponents fear a patchwork of state and local laws, but Congress has done little to regulate the emerging technology.
In the wee hours Tuesday morning, Cantwell teamed with Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., to toss the provision in any form. Only Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., opposed their amendment. Cruz ended up supporting it.
“The Senate came together tonight to say that we can’t just run over good state consumer protection laws,” said Cantwell, a Democrat. “States can fight robocalls, deepfakes and provide safe autonomous vehicle laws. 
“This also allows us to work together nationally to provide a new federal framework on artificial intelligence,” she added.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown was among the dozens of attorneys general urging the Senate not to pass the AI proposal. His office houses a state task force focused on artificial intelligence.
This year, the Washington state Legislature considered bills to require public employers to bargain with unions over the use of artificial intelligence, force generative AI developers to help users detect its use and punish people who digitally create or alter images to show minors engaged in sexual conduct.
Brown has sued a software company accused of using algorithms powered by AI to set rents for residential housing.
The first-term Democratic attorney general also requested the Legislature protect children from artificial intelligence-fed social media applications.
“We have so much opportunity at the state level to move forward and innovate and have new ways to protect our kids and all of our residents,” Brown said last month, “but we want to make sure that we have the ability to do that.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chat-gpt-artificial-intelligence.jpeg,,,2025-07-01 16:08:06.305527

Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, who passed away in June, will take place Aug. 26.
De Witt, 66, died following a battle with pancreatic cancer on June 25. He was elected in 2022 to the Iowa Senate to represent Senate District 1, representing a section of Woodbury County including Sioux City and Lawton. He defeated the incumbent Democrat, Sen. Jackie Smith, D-Sioux City for the position. Prior to serving in the Legislature, he served on the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors.

The August special election to fill the seat will elect a person to serve out the remainder of De Witt’s term, until January 2027. The candidates in the race have not yet been chosen — before the election, the state Democratic and Republican parties will convene district nominating conventions and have delegates select party nominees for the seat.
This special election will be the fourth this year for Iowa legislative seats.
In January, Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, defeated Republican Katie Whittington in the race to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer, who resigned from her position after becoming lieutenant governor in December 2024. Rep. Blaine Watkins, R-Donnellson, won in a March special election, filling a seat in House District 100 following the unexpected death of Rep. Martin Graber, R-Fort Madison. And in April, Rep. Angelina Ramirez, R-Cedar Rapids, won a special election filling the seat left by former Rep. Sami Scheetz after he resigned to serve on the Linn County Board of Supervisors.
While Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, Democrats have done better than expected in 2025 special elections. Zimmer’s victory was in an area formerly represented by a Republican, Cournoyer, who was elected in 2018 and reelected with 61% of the vote in 2023. While Watkins, a Republican, won in House District 100, he won with 51.5% against Democrat Nannette Griffins’ 48.2% — a much closer margin of victory than Graber’s 2024 election win of 67.9% against independent Nicolas Atwood.

(Courtesy of Burleigh Morton Detention Center)A Bismarck man who formerly ran for mayor of the city has been accused in state and federal court of defrauding public assistance programs of more than $1.8 million.
Isaac Osei Afoakwa, a 55-year-old businessman and pastor, has been charged with six counts of federal wire fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, two counts of preparing and presenting false tax returns and three counts of making false statements relating to a health care benefit program. All 12 counts are felonies. Afoakwa has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
In a separate criminal case in Burleigh County District Court, Afoakwa faces a felony charge of first offense Medicaid fraud in excess of $50,000. His business, Bismarck Transportation Services, faces the same criminal charge.
A lawyer representing him in both the state and federal cases on Tuesday declined to comment.
According to a redacted federal indictment filed in early June, Afoakwa is accused of fraudulently applying for 34 Paycheck Protection Program loans and eight Economic Injury Disaster loans beginning in March 2020. Both were funded by federal coronavirus relief money set aside by Congress to help businesses struggling to stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The indictment, signed by Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl, claims Afoakwa used his identity as well as the identities of others for the fraudulent applications. He falsified tax forms, Secretary of State documents and bank records to make the paperwork look legitimate, according to court records.
While he applied for the money under the guise that they were real businesses, all of the relief money went into Afoakwa’s pocket, the records state. He wrongfully received more than $1.6 million from the two relief programs, according to the indictment. Afoakwa allegedly did not report the money he made from this scheme on his federal taxes.
Afoakwa also is accused in the federal case of stealing roughly $100,000 from North Dakota Medicaid. His transportation business has an agreement with the program to provide non-emergency medical transportation to Medicaid members. The federal indictment states that he wrongfully billed the program for rides that never took place and lied about the type of vehicle he used so he could charge more money, among other things. He also claimed to transport people who were incarcerated to and from appointments, so the services could not have taken place, court records say.
According to an affidavit filed in state court in June, the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation received a report in March 2024 from Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota that Afoakwa appeared to be billing for medical transportation for a Medicaid recipient’s methadone treatment that had not taken place.
The affidavit, submitted by Bureau of Criminal Investigation Special Agent Brian Updike, alleges that Afoakwa received more than $200,000 in compensation from fraudulent North Dakota Medicaid claims between January 2022 and September 2024.
Afoakwa is scheduled to appear before South Central District Court Judge Jason Hammes for an arraignment at 9 a.m. July 14 in Burleigh County District Court.
A jury trial for the state case against Afoakwa is scheduled to start Oct. 7.
A jury trial for the federal case against him is scheduled to begin Nov. 4 before U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor.
In a June video posted on the Facebook page for his church, Grace Action Chapel International, Afoakwa asked his congregation to stay calm with respect to the criminal cases against him.
“Let’s continue to pray, for we will surely prevail,” he said.
Afoakwa unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Bismarck in 2018. He received about 4.2% of the vote, losing to Steve Bakken.
According to a Monday announcement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for North Dakota, the federal case against Afoakwa is part of a larger effort by the U.S. Department of Justice to combat health care fraud.

Nessel in a news release announced that she is looking into Twin Flames Universe, a new age spiritual organization with a large online following. The organization promises to match people with their soulmates, coined as “twin flames”, but has received criticism as being a self help and wellness cult. Documentaries on the group include “Desperately Seeking Soulmate: Escaping Twin Flames Universe” and “Escaping Twin Flames.”
The group operates out of Leelanau County and is run by Jeff and Shaleia Divine.
Nessel said she executed multiple search warrants on individuals at the top of the organization and its associated properties. The attorney general said a judge found probable cause that crimes may have been committed by the group and its leadership, leading to the search warrants.
Nessel asked anyone with information about potential criminal conduct regarding Twin Flames Universe or their members to contact her office.
Special Agents from the Department of Attorney General, along with the U.S. Department of Labor – Office of Inspector General, and law enforcement officers from Michigan State Police, the Leelanau County Sheriff’s Office and the Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office executed search warrants on Tuesday.

Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has parted ways with his long-time communications director. 
Crystal Staley, the former spokesperson for the governor’s office, has been succeeded by Scottie Ellis, the governor’s office confirmed Tuesday. 
“Crystal Staley has been a crucial part of Team Kentucky for years, serving during my time as Attorney General and Governor,” Beshear said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern. “Through unprecedented challenges and historic wins, Crystal was always there to ensure the people of Kentucky were updated and informed. I am grateful to her for her years of service, and wish her the best of luck in this next chapter.”
Staley was director of communications for the governor’s office since Beshear was inaugurated in 2019, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before that, she was director of communications for Beshear’s Attorney General office. 
Staley thanked Beshear “for the opportunity to serve the people of Kentucky,” according to a statement from her shared by the governor’s office. 
“I am grateful for the relationships I’ve built and the support I’ve received from so many people over the years,” Staley said.

Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice cast their votes in support of their party’s massive policy bill.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” narrowly passed 51 to 50 in the Senate Tuesday after an all-night session voting on amendments. Vice President JD Vance cast the legislation’s tie-breaking vote. 
At nearly 1,000 pages, the bill extends and expands a 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level, according to reporting by States Newsroom. It also makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs. 
To do so, the bill slashes funding to the Medicaid program and shifts significant costs of the Supplemental Food Nutrition Program to the states for the first time. 
In a statement Tuesday, Capito celebrated the passage, saying the legislation includes “significant wins” for the state.  
“The Republican Reconciliation bill is a clear reflection of our priorities: securing our borders, rebuilding our military, preventing the largest tax increase in U.S. history, and unleashing American energy,” Capito said. “I was proud to vote in favor of this commonsense legislation that not only delivers on the promises we’ve made to the American people, but will put West Virginia and our entire nation on a path to greater economic growth, national security, energy independence and opportunity.”
Justice said in a statement the bill provides lasting tax relief and establishes common sense reform to social programs.
“Throughout this process, I worked closely with both President Trump and my Senate colleagues to not only safeguard West Virginia’s interests, but bring prosperity to the state and provide opportunity to the working men and women of this country. West Virginia elected me to be their voice in Washington and deliver lasting positive results just as I did while governor — I am confident this bill is a strong step in the right direction and I will continue my work with President Trump to make life better for West Virginians.”
According to health care advocacy organization “Protect our Care,” the bill as it passed Tuesday would cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and take health care from more than 17 million Americans. It would increase health insurance premiums for more than 20 million people by eliminating tax credits that made health coverage affordable. 
The bill would raise the nation’s debt limit by $5 trillion. 
The legislation has been met with criticism and alarm by some in West Virginia, where more than 500,000 residents rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program for their health coverage and one in six residents receives SNAP benefits. 
Six protestors were arrested for trespassing last week while attempting a sit-in in opposition to the bill at Capito’s Charleston office. 
Health care advocacy organization West Virginians for Affordable Health Care said in a statement Tuesday Capito and Justice “turned their back” on West Virginians, by supporting the bill. 
“Both Senators Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice said they went to Congress to help West Virginians; however, they both voted Monday on a bill that will make life more expensive, unmanageable and vulnerable for all but the wealthiest of us,” Executive Director Ellen Allen said. “Not only did they lay the groundwork to dismantle health care for hundreds of thousands of West Virginians, their vote will saddle and hamstring our sons, daughters and grandchildren with backbreaking debt that will make it all but impossible for us to reclaim these losses. This will have negative consequences for generations to come. “
Lynette Maselli, state director of Protect our Care, said  in a statement that Justice and Capito had the power to stop the bill. 
“Instead, they put billionaires over West Virginians and voted to kick seniors out of nursing homes, rip health care away from disabled children, close rural hospitals and strip 17 million Americans of their health care all so they and Donald Trump can give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations,” she said. 
The state Democratic Party suggested that Capito supported the bill in exchange for her son, former state Del. Moore Capito, being nominated to U.S. Attorney for the Southern District West Virginia. Capito announced the political appointment on the social media platform X. 
“One has to wonder why Sen. Capito would be such an enthusiastic cheerleader for a bill that is so devastating to West Virginia and its citizens,” Del. Mike Pushkin, chair of the Democratic Party, said in a statement. “One logical explanation is that she’s holding out for a deal… her vote in exchange for her son’s political advancement. If so, that’s not public service — that’s corruption.”
Pushkin said by supporting the bill, Capito and Justice failed to stand up for West Virginia residents. 
“This budget won’t make life better for West Virginians, it will rob them of their health insurance, take food off the table and kill good-paying jobs — all to line the pockets of the GOP’s billionaire donors,” he said. “This budget is nothing short of an attack on working families across West Virginia. Democrats in West Virginia are mobilizing to hold Republicans accountable everywhere because the stakes have never been higher.” 
The legislation now goes back to the House of Representatives to consider the changes the Senate made to the bill. Trump has said he wants the legislation on his desk by the July Fourth holiday Friday.

(Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — some under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states, including Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.

(Photo illustration by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)What a mess South Carolina lawmakers created when they tried, with little public debate, to raise their own pay by a whopping 80% this past legislative session.
The proposal came late in the legislative session out of nowhere, like a bad karaoke singer at a wedding. But soon a majority of legislators were crooning from the same page.
Lawmakers voted to include a $1,500 monthly raise — $18,000 annually — for themselves in the state budget.
Nice trick, eh? When, dear reader, was the last time you gave yourself an 80% pay raise?
Granted, lawmakers haven’t seen a pay rise since the 1990s, but a sudden, unexpected and excessive boost of 80% in one year is, if not obscene, at least unseemly.
It makes lawmakers appear greedy, self-serving and callously indifferent to the struggles many South Carolinians face in today’s chaotic economy.
At a time of so much cynicism about government and other public institutions, South Carolina lawmakers shouldn’t be promoting mistrust.
It’s obviously hypocritical for legislators, so many of whom call themselves “conservative,” to be so generous to themselves with the taxpayer’s dollar while being stingy with programs like the proposed Medicaid expansion for the struggling and vulnerable in South Carolina.
State lawmakers, considered part-time workers, also allow themselves health and life insurance benefits that are harder to access for many other part-time state workers.
Karma happens
But that’s just the beginning of the story. In the wake of the pay raise, along came karma in the form of the state Supreme Court. Smelling a rat, the court suspended the $1,500 monthly raise legislators gave themselves.
Worse for legislators, the court also halted the $1,000 lawmakers have been receiving each month since 1995 through so-called “in-district compensation,” as the SC Daily Gazette’s Skylar Laird recently reported.

The bottom line: Instead of a $18,000 annual pay raise, lawmakers could get a $12,000 annual pay cut.
The state Supreme Court’s actions were prompted by a request from state Sen. Wes Climer, a Rock Hill Republican who challenged the pay increase and must be rather unpopular at legislative parties right now.
That $12,000 reduction, however, may be only temporary, lasting a few months. What happens next depends on what the state Supreme Court decides.
Yes, it’s all a bit hard to keep up with, so let’s cut to the chase with two important points:
• A proposed pay raise for lawmakers should have gone through a committee process that would have allowed for public input and flagged constitutional issues, as Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said in Laird’s article.
• In addition, a pay increase ideally should be incremental, growing by a few percentage points each year — in the same way lawmakers rightfully raise, for instance, teacher salaries.
That’s how most of the real world operates. If you work your butt off, maybe you get an annual raise of a few percentage points, maybe not.
A modest increase
Lawmakers do deserve modest pay increases over time, but not an 80% boost in one fell swoop. Also, lawmakers should not shut out the public on such important issues.
South Carolina might also follow the lead of 21 other states that appoint independent commissions to recommend salaries. The process should always be transparent.
Legislators, as part-time workers, generally spend about five months, three days a week, in session in Columbia.
For that, they receive an annual salary of $10,400 and stipends for food and lodging during the session, which are currently $240 per day.
Plus, lawmakers get $1,000 a month for “in-district expenses.” That money can be used for almost anything, so it seems fair to consider that as part of their total salary. That’s
the money that has been temporarily halted by the state Supreme Court — along with the $1,500 monthly raise.
By the way, for those who want to check my math, I arrived at the 80% figure simply by adding legislators’ two sources of wages — their salaries plus in-district expense money. I excluded per-diem funds, which can vary and are used directly for legislators’ expenses while in Columbia.
The $18,000 increase therefore would amount to slightly more than an 80% pay raise.
This is not the first time state leaders have supported outsized pay increases for state officials.
Last year, a state commission (dominated by legislators) approved huge pay increases (as high as $58,000) for seven agency heads. In 2022, that state commission doubled the salaries of the state attorney general and state education superintendent while handing out big raises to other statewide elected officials.
To be fair, a modest and incremental pay raise for legislators could have a beneficial effect, leading to a more diverse legislative body in Columbia. Right now, the General Assembly is dominated by male lawyers, male business owners and male retirees who, many would argue, create state policy beneficial to male lawyers, male business owners and male retirees.
Meanwhile, the concerns of mothers and women in general are marginalized in Columbia.
Reasonable wage increases over time could result in a richer policy conversation in Columbia and perhaps even nudge the South Carolina General Assembly toward the mainstream of American politics.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Statehouse-lightning-strike-1024x598.jpg,,,2025-07-01 15:09:12.202904

The measure heads to the U.S. House for consideration. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas voted with fellow Republicans to secure passage of the Senate’s controversial budget and tax bill featuring domestic policy priorities of President Donald Trump.
Vice President J.D. Vance capped lengthy debate by casting a tie-breaking vote to send the amended “big, beautiful bill” back to the U.S. House for reconsideration. The president urged federal lawmakers in the House and Senate to complete work on the package by July 4.
“The lefty fake news media has failed to tell the truth about this bill, that it will deliver a win for every single American,” Marshall said. “This is President Trump’s legacy and we are entering America’s golden era.”
Marshall said colleagues aligned with the president were obligated to vote for the Senate bill. “If you supported President Trump, you should support this bill,” he said.
In addition, Marshall said the legislation would spark such a massive expansion of the U.S. economy that it would “help shrink the debt.” The claim conflicted with a congressional budget estimate the bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next decade. The Senate bill would increase the federal debt limit by $5 trillion.
Moran said he voted for the Senate’s bill because it would extend federal income tax provisions Trump signed into law in 2017 and invest $320 billion in immigration enforcement and the military.
The bill also would slash federal safety net spending on food stamps. It would allow wind and solar tax credits if construction of those renewable energy projects began within a year of the law’s enactment or go into production before the end of 2027.
Moran said the Senate’s amended version of the bill would “bolster our economy and strengthen the safety of our nation.”
His post-vote statement focused on amendments to the bill designed to moderate damage to rural hospitals in wake of cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.
“I was able to make changes to the legislation to make certain Kansas hospitals will not face any immediate cuts upon enactment of this legislation,” Moran said.
Moran lauded a $50 billion, five-year fund providing emergency assistance to rural hospitals at risk of closure.
Meanwhile, Moran touted $12.5 billion in appropriations to the Federal Aviation Administration to modernize air traffic control infrastructure. It included language giving farmers greater flexibility in acquiring credit and updated farm subsidy programs.
In May, the U.S. House delegation from Kansas split along party lines on the original version of the bill. Republican U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt and Ron Estes voted for that package, but Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids dissented.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Moran-on-VA-2-1024x558.png,,,2025-07-01 15:09:12.202904

(AP) — A federal judge has ruled that recent mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were likely unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to halt plans to downsize and reorganize the nation’s health workforce.
U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong was part of the coalition that filed the lawsuit. 
DuBose said the states had shown “irreparable harm,” from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that “HHS’s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.”
“The executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,” DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.
Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.
The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to 15. Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases.
The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency’s authority. The lawsuit also says the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states.
“The intended effect … was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,” the lawsuit argued.
The cuts are part of a federal “Make America Healthy Again” directive to streamline costly agencies and reduce redundancies. Kennedy told senators at a May 14 hearing that there is “so much chaos and disorganization” at HHS.
But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated.
In a statement Tuesday, Attorney General Tong said, “Donald Trump and RFK Jr. are playing dangerous games with the health and safety of American families, and we just stopped them. 
“Today’s order means vital programs and services— including those supporting Head Start, disease monitoring at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SNAP and Medicaid eligibility, and others—will remain accessible,” Tong said. “This is still the beginning of a long fight ahead, but we’re not going to let Trump and RFK Jr. dismantle our nation’s health systems to promote conspiracy theories and tax breaks for billionaires.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)Kentucky health advocates are urging the U.S. House to reject Senate changes to a sweeping budget bill, warning the measure will leave many Kentuckians without access to medical care or food assistance. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed 51-50 thanks to a tiebreaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. It  would make deeper cuts to Medicaid than the House version while raising the debt limit by $5 trillion.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was one of three Republicans voting against the bill because it would be “adding to our debt.” The measure now returns to the House where some Republicans are unhappy with the Senate changes to safety net and green energy programs.
Jason Bailey, executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the proposal will “strip health care and food assistance from millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians, while ensuring the wealthiest households benefit from a bounty of new tax cuts.”  
“As Kentucky’s U.S. House delegation prepares to consider the Senate version of this bill, we urge the members to prioritize the vast majority of Kentuckians and oppose cuts to vital health care, food assistance, and education programs that are crucial to Kentuckians’ health and well-being and critical for our state’s economy,” Bailey said. 
The measure squeaked through the House 215-214 on May 22 along mostly party lines. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky split with the GOP to vote against the bill, saying it would increase federal deficits and debt.  
The four other Republicans in Kentucky’s delegation voted for the bill, including Rep. Hal Rogers, whose Eastern Kentucky district is heavily dependent on Medicaid. Among Rogers’ constituents, 44 % are covered by the federal-state program that pays for 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
Alexus Richardson, the director of communications for the Louisville-based Dare to Care food bank, said the federal government would be “kicking people while they’re already down” if Congress gives final approval to the proposals, which is “the wrong message.” 
“Many families are already struggling. People have not caught up from the pandemic. That’s why we’re seeing long lines as it is,” she said. 
Here’s how advocates and health experts say the budget bill would affect Kentucky, by sector. 
Food assistance

Both the House and Senate versions of the bill are “unacceptable,” Richardson with Dare to Care said. The Senate version proposes deeper cuts than the House’s, though. Among other proposals, the bill would shift costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, to states. 
Food banks, Richardson told the Lantern, are “already stretched to meet current needs” and “cuts to SNAP and Medicaid not only deepen food insecurity and poverty across our community, they also increase demand on food banks.” 
About 753,410 Kentuckians are food insecure, according to a May report from Feeding America. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, that number was 644,540. Being food insecure means a person may not have enough to eat and may not know where their next meal will come from.

The bill heads back to the House for any revisions and another vote. 
“We urge our lawmakers to protect these critical programs, not cut them,” Richardson said. 
If these proposed cuts make it through, Dare to Care could have to turn people away or add new requirements to qualify for food aid. 
“We don’t want to do that. We really don’t want to have to place any kind of restrictions for what we know families need,” Richardson said. But, the organization needs resources to avoid that. “We’re here to fill in the gaps. We’re not here to replace federal programs like SNAP.” 
Kentucky hospitals
The Kentucky Hospital Association has not responded to a Lantern email seeking comment to Tuesday’s Senate vote. Nancy Galvagni, the organization’s president & CEO, signed onto a June 26 letter that warned the bill could hurt rural hospitals. 
“Rural hospitals, along with providers serving rural communities, face significant challenges and serve a large proportion of patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare, both of which reimburse hospitals and providers below the cost of care,” the letter, signed by 14 hospital associations, said. “Consequently, nearly half of rural hospitals operate with negative margins.” 
The letter warned that more than 750 rural hospitals are at risk of closing and 14 are at “immediate risk.” 
“We continue to remind our congressional delegations how all hospitals – rural, urban, and suburban – are key to the healthcare continuum and are facing headwinds that could destabilize health and healthcare in our states,” the hospital associations said. 
Family Health Centers

Dr. Bart Irwin, the CEO of Family Health Centers (FHC) in Louisville, said he’s “saddened and disappointed at the Senate’s passage of HR1.” 
FHC provides health care services on a sliding-fee scale to people who are uninsured or have other barriers to getting health care. More than half of FHC’s patients have Medicaid, Irwin said. 
“This bill is ugly for Kentuckians and community health centers, like Family Health Centers,” he said. “This is a double whammy for patients, who are hardworking, disabled, caring for family members, or are in school.” 
He warned the bill would cause people to lose their Medicaid and become uninsured. 
“Patients who lose their Medicaid don’t go away; they return to community health centers as uninsured patients,” Irwin said. “It is likely that they will lose their health care providers as well since community health centers, like Family Health Centers, depend upon Medicaid payments to sustain their operations. The loss of Medicaid revenue and greatly increased uninsured patients will make health center operations unsustainable.” 
Planned Parenthood

In a Tuesday news release, Planned Parenthood said more than a third of its patients are covered by Medicaid and “blocking access to Planned Parenthood Medicaid enrollees would overwhelm Kentucky’s already overstretched safety net.”  
While not mentioning Planned Parenthood by name, the bill bans Medicaid payments to  clinics and providers that offer abortions even for other health care, such as cancer screenings, and family planning services they provide. 
“If this bill becomes law, thousands of patients who get care at Planned Parenthood’s two health centers in Kentucky would lose Medicaid coverage at their preferred provider, and many will be left with no alternative provider,” Planned Parenthood said. The organization has clinics in Louisville and Lexington.
  Rebecca Gibron (Planned Parenthood photo)
Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, which includes Kentucky, said the Senate vote “puts millions of lives at risk across the country, including here in Kentucky, meaning if this bill becomes law, the consequences will be catastrophic.” 
“Our health centers save Kentucky nearly $4.2 million each year by preventing unplanned pregnancies, catching cancers early, and controlling the spread of STIs,” Gibron said. “Stripping that care away, especially now—amid rural hospital closures, a maternal mortality crisis, and a deepening provider shortage—would push an already broken system past the brink.” 
Opioid Use Disorder 
In 2024, 142,312 Kentuckians received addiction services through Medicaid, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report.
Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Gov. Andy Beshear, said those services,“from medically-managed withdrawal to counseling and more” helped Kentucky’s overdose deaths decline three years in a row. 
“That progress is now at risk due to the ‘big, ugly bill’s’’ Medicaid cuts, which will cost lives and tear families apart,” Ellis said in a statement. “Gov. Andy Beshear has taken every opportunity to raise his voice about the risks and stand against these deadly cuts, including to state and federal leaders.” 




Politicians react
Kentucky’s Sen. Rand Paul posted on X, formerly Twitter, that he worked all night to stop Congress from adding to our debt” and in doing so “was fighting for the American people and against our out-of-control debt.” 
“I offered my vote for fiscal sanity,” Paul wrote. “Congress chose to sell out taxpayers instead. Only once the bill is released, we will know what the true price was.” 
Senator Mitch McConnell, on the other hand, praised the Senate’s work. 
“The American people sent President Trump and Republican majorities to Washington with a clear mandate: secure the border, restore peace through strength and American energy dominance, and give working families and small businesses relief from the Biden economy,” he said in a statement. “Our votes today are a step toward fulfilling that duty.” 
Kentucky Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, D-Louisville, posted on social media that the bill would  “devastate Kentucky.”  
“This bill is great for those rolling in money, but not good for every day Kentuckians — terminating healthcare is devastating for children, working families, the elderly, the disabled, and veterans,” Stevenson, who is running for McConnell’s seat as he isn’t seeking reelection, said in her X post. “This is NOT what the American people voted for. This is what DC politicians voted for.”  
In a video uploaded to Bluesky, Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville Democrat, called the bill “terrible” and said “I’ve landed in DC and I’m on my way to the House to do everything I can to try to stop it.” 
“This means having conversations with my Republican colleagues, asking them to stand up and do in public what they’re saying in private, that this bill is bad. It’s wrong and hurts people. It shouldn’t be hard.”

Mike DeWine discussing his budget vetoes. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)With his signature late Monday night, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has allowed a controversial funding plan for a new Cleveland Browns stadium to go forward. The state will tap its multi-billion-dollar pool of unclaimed funds — money which belongs to ordinary Ohioans — to pay for the Browns’ stadium and other sports and cultural facilities in the future.
Shortly before DeWine signed the budget, Attorney General Dave Yost urged him to veto the provision. Yost argued taking money from Ohioans to fund a privately owned stadium is “poor policy.” Two former Democratic lawmakers who threatened a class action lawsuit last week, said they’re going forward.

DeWine did, however, make one minor tweak to the funding mechanism. The initial program set a $500 million threshold. Projects beyond that amount were eligible for up to 25% of the cost in state funds, but those costing less were only eligible for 15% in state funds.
The governor argued that cost floor “would have the perverse incentive of encouraging projects to become unnecessarily more expensive simply to meet a threshold for state funding.” Instead, all projects will be capped at a 25% state share.
Can they do that? Ohio Senators propose novel, if questionable, Browns stadium funding plan

Why let it go forward?
Although the governor declined to veto the use of unclaimed funds, he didn’t completely embrace the approach.
“Well, as you know, that was not my first choice, I had another way of doing it,” DeWine told reporters Tuesday. The governor’s opening bid would’ve increased taxes on sports betting to fund new facilities. “But, you know, governors don’t get everything they want. Nobody gets everything they want.”
He explained that even if “we’re all invested in our own ideas,” he took a step back and focused on his priorities.
“To me, the biggest objectives were no taxpayers’ dollars used for this, in the sense of nothing coming out of general fund — nothing competing against education,” DeWine explained, “and it couldn’t just be about the Browns, it had to be universal.”
“When you get the two prime objectives,” DeWine added, “it seems to me it’s time to say, ‘Yeah, I’m achieving what I wanted to achieve.’”
The Haslams gave big donations to Ohio lawmakers, who are now deciding the fate of Browns stadium

In a social media post, Browns team owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam praised DeWine for approving the plan and promised to deliver a “transformative project” that will create a “generational impact.”
Still, DeWine’s own comments underscore how fine a line he’s walking. The new fund will be built exclusively on taxpayers’ dollars in the form of old deposits or reimbursements that state officials are holding until claimed. The governor stresses that “stadiums should not compete with mental health. Stadiums should not compete with education.” By sidestepping the general fund, the budget avoids those tradeoffs.
But it’s a distinction that might not make a difference to average Ohioans.
The National Association of State Treasurers — officials typically tasked with unclaimed funds oversight — is explicit in its stance that a state’s role is merely custodial, and citizens’ right to recover property should be maintained in perpetuity.
Ohio’s new budget gives claimants a 10-year grace period, but following that, all assets left in the unclaimed funds trust for more than 10 years will get transferred to the stadium and cultural facilities fund.


Tax relief for every Ohioan
No money for sports stadiums
Cut the waste and bureaucracy
— Rep. Ron Ferguson (@ronfergusonohio) June 5, 2025


The criticism
Ohio’s unclaimed funds trust is worth close to $5 billion, and much of that money has been parked there for well over a decade. But simply taking those dollars, particularly to benefit a billionaire professional team owner, didn’t sit well with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
In his letter to DeWine, Yost acknowledged some states have instituted similar transfers, but he expressed discomfort unclaimed dollars becoming state dollars in just 10 years.
“This timeline makes Ohio an outlier nationally,” Yost wrote, “and risks inadvertently harming taxpayers unaware they have money in the state’s unclaimed funds.”
In a reference to the Ohio constitution’s eminent domain provisions, he argued “the statutory taking of public funds without clear public benefit is poor policy.” State Supreme Court precedent in cases like Norwood v. Horney holds that governments must demonstrate a public benefit to take private property.
“Billionaires should finance their own stadiums—full stop,” Yost added. “The $600 million handout for a single professional sports facility raises serious concerns about fiscal sustainability and fairness.”
Democratic former Ohio lawmakers threaten lawsuit over Cleveland Browns stadium funding plan

Ohio’s former Attorney General Marc Dann, and former state Rep. Jeff Crossman, both Democrats, visited the statehouse as lawmakers were getting ready to vote on the budget. They warned that if lawmakers went forward, they would file a class action lawsuit.
Tuesday morning, Crossman said, “If Governor DeWine and the legislative majority think they can betray Ohioans’ constitutional property rights without a fight — they’re dead wrong.”
“They’re getting the lawsuit they clearly invited,” he added, “and just like the case decided yesterday on (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance) benefits, we intend to win. Because when the state breaks the law, someone has to stand up for the people of Ohio”.
The governor himself appeared resigned to a fight in court. In bit of homespun storytelling, DeWine recalled being a young lawyer arguing with an older judge in Green County.
“He looked at me and said, Mister DeWine, that’s why God made the Court of Appeals,” DeWine said. “And so, you know, when don’t people don’t like things, they can go to court, and that’s what we have in our system.”

A 3-2 majority of the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, that the state’s adequacy formula, which provides a base amount of $4,266 per student to public schools, does not pay an “adequate education” and violates constitutional obligations. (Courtesy Litchfield School District)New Hampshire does not provide constitutionally adequate education funding for school districts, the state Supreme Court held Tuesday, in a major decision that could force sweeping legislative changes.
In a long-anticipated ruling, a 3-2 majority on the court found that New Hampshire’s adequacy formula, which currently provides a base amount of $4,266 per student to public schools, does not sufficiently pay an “adequate education” and violates the constitutional obligations set out in a pair of landmark decisions in the 1990s.
“In summary, the record supports the trial court’s conclusion that RSA 198:40-a does not support constitutional muster,” the majority opinion in the case, Contoocook Valley School District v. New Hampshire states. “…It is now incumbent upon the legislative and executive branches to remedy the constitutional deficiency that we have identified.” 
But the ruling was mixed: The court endorsed a Superior Court ruling from 2023 that found that the state should spend at least $7,356.01 per student in order to account for an adequate education. But it stopped short of ordering the state to immediately begin sending more money to schools, holding that doing so would violate the separation of powers doctrine.
School funding advocates and Democrats cheered the result and called on the Legislature to begin making plans to increase the amount sent to schools. Advocates have argued for decades that the state underfunds its share of school funding, forcing districts to rely on local property taxes and creating disparities between wealthier towns and poorer towns.
But Gov. Kelly Ayotte denounced the ruling, and said her office was “evaluating” it “to determine the appropriate next steps.”
“The court reached the wrong decision today. The fact is, New Hampshire is top 10 in the country when it comes to funding our children’s education,” Ayotte said in a statement, referring to the state’s average school spending when counting both local and state funding. 
The voting breakdown of the court’s decision was complicated. Two of the state’s usual five justices did not participate in the ruling. Chief Justice Gordon MacDonald recused himself because he was serving as attorney general when the lawsuit was first filed, and had helped the state defend against it. And Associate Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi has been on administrative leave from the court since July 2024, pending a criminal case against her for allegedly interfering with the criminal investigation of her husband. 
Following the statutory substitution procedure, two retired superior court judges took their place: Judge Tina Nadeau, who served on the Supreme Court in 1996, and Judge Gillian Abramson. Those two judges were chosen at random from a pool of retired superior court judges, following state statute.
In the majority, 3-2 opinion, Associate Justice James Bassett wrote that the current allocation of state funding to schools is unconstitutionally low and must be fixed, and substitute judges Nadeau and Abramson joined him. Associate Justices Patrick Donovan and Melissa Countway dissented on that point.
But in a second ruling, Bassett held that the state does not need to immediately rectify the problem with an increase to state adequacy; on that point, Donovan and Countway agreed with Bassett while Nadeau and Abramson dissented.
Decision affirms Superior Court’s decision
The result is a majority opinion that the Legislature must act and must increase its per pupil school spending, with an acknowledgement that lawmakers and the governor, not the court, should decide how best to do that.
The opinion affirmed much of Rockingham Superior Court Judge David Ruoff’s November 2023 decision in which he ruled in favor of the school districts and set a minimum per-pupil number for adequate state spending that was based on his calculations of what it costs school districts to educate a child. 
Writing for the majority, Bassett praised Ruoff’s method of calculating the actual cost of providing an adequate education. That cost should include “facilities operation and maintenance, transportation, principals, administrative assistants, custodians, and nurses,” Bassett wrote. 
Bassett ruled that the state had not successfully rebutted the argument that those costs should be included in the calculation. And he continued that because the costs should be included, $4,266 in base adequacy cannot be seen as constitutionally adequate. 
“Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s injunction to the extent it established “a conservative minimum threshold of $7,356.01 which base adequacy aid funding must exceed” as guidance for future legislative action,” Bassett wrote.
Hitting that minimum would cost the state more than $500 million per year, a near 50% increase of the state’s current spending. 
State, school districts spar at Supreme Court hearing over school funding

In their dissent, Countway and Donovan disagreed on several points. First, they asserted that the court should not limit its analysis to just the $4,266 in base adequacy per pupil, but should also include the additional provisions in which the state gives an additional $2,300 for every student whose family makes under 185% of the federal poverty level; $2,100 for every student who receives special education services; and $800 for every student who is an English language learner. Those additions brought the state’s allocations in line with the definition of adequacy, the two held. The Superior Court also inserted its own standards for proper student-teacher ratios to arrive at its $7,356.01 minimum, Countway and Donovan added, which inflated that amount.
Second, Countway and Donovan argued that regardless of state spending, New Hampshire children are receiving adequate educations when local education dollars are considered, noting that no school district in the 2021 to 2022 school year spent less than $14,000 per student when combining state and local spending. 
And third, Countway and Donovan contended that the separation of powers doctrine precludes the Supreme Court from issuing any mandates that the Legislature increase its spending.
“We believe that the trial court erred when it … established a conservative minimum threshold amount that base adequacy aid must exceed, thereby invading the legislature’s policy-making function,” the dissent wrote.
Legislative reaction mixed
It was not immediately clear how the Legislature might react to the decision. The ruling comes four days after Ayotte signed a two-year budget that did not raise the amount sent per pupil beyond increases for inflation. 
House Bill 2 of the budget also inserted a pronouncement by the Legislature ahead of the ruling:
“The legislature now deems it necessary to definitively proclaim that, as the sole branch of government constitutionally competent to establish state policy and to raise and appropriate public funds to carry out such policy, the legislature shall make the final determination of what the state’s educational policies shall be and of the funding needed to carry out such policies,” the Republican-passed bill states.
Lawmakers had sharply different reactions to the court’s ruling. Democrats embraced it.
“The Court’s decision unanimously affirms what Democrats have been saying for years — that the state inadequately funds public education and places too much burden on property taxpayers,” Rep. Dave Luneau, a Hopkinton Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday. “When the Legislature returns this fall, we must act immediately to fix our education funding inequities.” 
Senate President Sharon Carson and House Speaker Sherman Packard — both Republicans — objected to the ruling but did not outline specific actions.
“Since this latest case was filed, the Legislature has twice increased state education funding,” the Republican leaders wrote. “The current state budget going into effect today dedicates nearly $2.2 billion to local schools, yet the court continues to second guess legislative decisions to target aid to students and communities who need it most. The Court’s rampant judicial overreach is pushing New Hampshire towards a one-size-fits-all state-run school system.”
Carson and Packard made one promise: “The Legislature will continue to reform our schools while avoiding a broadbased sales or income tax.”

Mike DeWine used his veto power to nix a provision that would have prevented funds from going to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, a program that would have created an non-chartered education savings account, and blocked compliance to a new higher education law from being tied to state funding.
DeWine signed the budget late Monday night and it will go into effect on Oct. 1. He issued 67 vetoes, the most during his time as governor. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He vetoed a provision that would have prohibited giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
“We want homeless shelters to be open and for everyone,” he said. 
No Ohio youth should be turned away from a homeless shelter that receives state funds, DeWine wrote in his veto message. 
“The reality is that a homeless child has been through a horrible experience and likely needs to be met where that child is at emotionally,” he wrote. “If a shelter has to call a homeless youth a pronoun that is incongruent with that youth’s gender to get that person into a shelter so the child won’t freeze to death, it needs to be done without fear of getting funding clawed back.”
Non-chartered Educational Savings Account Program
DeWine vetoed the non-chartered Educational Savings Account Program, which would have allowed students going to noncharted nonpublic schools to get state funding for tuition through an educational savings account. 
These schools do not receive state or federal funds since they are not charted by the state. 
“There’s no accountability,” DeWine said. “There’s no tax dollars.” 
In his veto message, DeWine mentioned Bishop Sycamore, a former non-charted nonpublic school that pretended to have a football program in Columbus, but was ultimately discovered to be a scam in 2021. 
“There is a lack of oversight and compliance mechanisms for NCNP schools in Ohio law and rule,” he wrote. “Without proper accountability, this item would risk taxpayer dollars on programs that may have compromised educational quality or that could risk student safety.” 
The Ohio House added the provision to the budget, only to be taken out by the Senate, but it was brought back during conference committee.  
Higher education 
DeWine vetoed a provision that would have tied a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with Ohio Senate Bill 1, a new higher education law banning diversity efforts, creates post-tenure reviews and an American civic literacy course, among other things. 
Under the provision the Senate added to the budget, each university would have been required to submit a report showing compliance to the House and Senate higher education committees by March 1. 
“This violates the separation of powers that is embedded in the framework of the Ohio Constitution that define the substance and scope of powers granted to the three branches of state government and intrudes upon the constitutional authority of the executive branch to distribute funds that have been appropriated through this budget bill,” DeWine wrote in his veto message. 
The Ohio Department of Higher Education is able to determine compliance with the new law, DeWine wrote. 
Drivers training 
The budget raises the age that Ohio drivers must complete drivers training in order to get their license, from 18 to 21. 
The law currently says only those under 18 years old must complete the driver’s education course and complete 50 hours of practice driving with a licensed driver. The Ohio House added that provision to the budget, only to be taken out by the Senate, but it was brought back during conference committee.  
“We know that young people who go through driver’s training become safer drivers, safer for themselves and safer for everyone else on the road,” DeWine said. 
The most dangerous group of drivers are 18-25 year olds, DeWine said. 
“We have so many young people turning 18 never taking driver’s training,” he said. “In this budget, we’re protecting all Ohioans on the road. … We know that somebody who’s had driver’s training is statistically a better driver, and we know they’re less likely to kill somebody or kill themselves.”
Eye program 
The budget creates the OhioSEE program, which will give school-aged kids comprehensive eye exams.
DeWine originally put this in his version of the budget and it was added back in during conference committee after the Senate took it out. 
“Too many Ohio students fail a vision screening at their school, but then they never receive follow up eye care at all,” DeWine said. “Improving children’s vision will improve their success at school, which is a win for students, families and schools.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, which can develop unnoticed over several years, affects more than 40% of Hispanic patients and costs the U.S. health care system more than $100 billion annually. The most frustrating part is that this serious and sometimes lethal illness can be reversed with early identification and treatment.
MASLD is directly linked to obesity and represents an urgent yet overlooked health crisis —especially in Hispanic communities. By the time patients reach me, some are severely ill, and some will die without a liver transplant. Physicians know how to prevent MASLD: by treating obesity. Yet many patients lack access to the treatment and care that could be a lifesaver.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I recently treated a patient with significant fatty liver disease on course to develop liver cirrhosis. She had struggled with her weight for years, and despite her best efforts, she could not make any progress. I worked with her to introduce a lifestyle intervention program that focused on meal replacements and behavior change. She quickly learned that portion control was her biggest challenge, especially when eating out or celebrating holidays. Using what she’s learned from the program, she finally achieved sustainable weight loss and has been able to stop seven prescription medications. Her liver tests are now normal, and she has maintained this progress for four years. She is now a role model for her family and influences them to make healthier choices. Her progress is nothing short of inspiring.
In Colorado, the Hispanic community is the fastest-growing demographic and is diagnosed with obesity at rates higher than the general population. Certain genetic factors also increase the susceptibility of Hispanic patients to MASLD. But unless we address underlying obesity, we will continue to waste billions of dollars and lose countless lives needlessly.
In 2013, the American Medical Association declared obesity a disease due to its complex nature, shaped by genetics, environment and biology. This declaration was also intended to reduce the stigma associated with obesity so that patients would be more likely to seek help. However, the most effective treatments, such as nutritional counseling and new FDA-approved medications, are not covered by Colorado’s Medicaid program, making them inaccessible for those in greatest need.
At a time when Medicaid funding is in jeopardy, Colorado policymakers have an opportunity to reduce the cost of health care by covering less-costly nutritional counseling and behavioral therapy. Investing in coverage of FDA-approved obesity medications has the potential to reduce long-term costs even further, with better health outcomes.
Physicians and policymakers must come together to recognize the connection between obesity and liver disease and develop lasting solutions to ensure patients receive the treatment they deserve. The liver is the body’s natural detox system, and we cannot live without it. However, it can’t protect us if we don’t protect it.

Wharton,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/hr-1-cuts-protect-graduate-education-in-connecticut/,"Let’s be clear: this bill's changes would not reduce costs; they would simply shift the burden to students and institutions, such as SCSU.","Higher education has been a critical part of Connecticut’s notoriety for the public good, despite state and now proposed federal cuts. Graduate education – in particular – has been a worthwhile investment and is hardly a luxury in Connecticut.
At Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU), we educate the professionals who staff our schools, clinics, hospitals, labs, and public agencies. Many of our graduate students are first-generation college graduates and working adults striving to uplift themselves, their families, and their communities. That’s why the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (H.R.1), recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and today by the Senate, is so deeply troubling.
The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), which represents more than 400 institutions nationally, including many in New England, recently sent a letter to Senate leadership warning of the severe consequences of this bill for graduate education. The bill, as written, would:

Terminate the Graduate PLUS Loan Program by 2026, which thousands of graduate and professional students rely on to bridge the gap between tuition and federal unsubsidized loan limits; 
Impose strict caps on student borrowing $100,000 for graduate students, $150,000 for professional students, and a $200,000 lifetime cap; ignoring the reality of advanced, high-cost programs; 
Require institutions to repay the federal government for student loan balances deemed “unrecoverable,” disproportionately impacting regional public universities; 
Cap financial aid based on the national median cost of programs, regardless of actual expenses; 
And dramatically increase taxes on university endowments, reducing scholarships, fellowships, and research funding. 

Let’s be clear: these changes would not reduce costs; they would simply shift the burden to students and institutions, such as Southern that are already operating with limited resources.
The Connecticut impact
In Connecticut, approximately 17,000 students are enrolled in graduate or professional programs across public and private institutions. Many of them come from working- and middle-class backgrounds, and nearly 30% identify as students of color, reflecting our state’s commitment to equitable access to education. 
According to the Connecticut Department of Labor, over 40% of jobs are projected to grow fastest through 2030, including in health care, education, and mental health services, require a graduate degree or specialized post-baccalaureate training.
Moreover, median student debt nationally among borrowers who pursue graduate education often exceeds $60,000. The Grad PLUS Loan program, targeted for elimination in the bill, provides essential financing to help these students enter critical fields without being forced into predatory private loans that carry interest rates up to 16%.
Connecticut’s regional public universities such as Southern Connecticut State University play a unique and vital role in training the state’s workforce. But the institutional “risk-sharing” measures in H.R.1 would penalize these institutions for serving non-traditional and first-generation students who are statistically more likely to face financial hardship after graduation, regardless of their ultimate success.
At SCSU, nearly 50% of our graduate students identify as students of color, and over 40% are first-generation college students. These students are not only succeeding academically, they are preparing to become Connecticut’s next generation of school counselors, nurses, educators, nonprofit leaders, and scientists. Most importantly, over 80% of our students remain in Connecticut after they graduate, contributing their skills and knowledge directly to our local communities.
These proposed federal changes would cut off their most reliable access to affordable financing, forcing them to turn to private loans with high interest rates. Meanwhile, capping loans based on median national cost will underfund programs that are more expensive to deliver, such as our STEM education, communication disorders, nursing, and counseling that require intensive clinical placements.
The consequences wouldn’t only be limited to students but would ripple through every sector in Connecticut. Our state, like nationwide trends, is already struggling with shortages in teaching, mental health, nursing, and health professions. Federal changes that make graduate education less affordable and accessible will further deepen these shortages, undermining efforts to recruit and retain talented and qualified professionals.
Future considerations will be lessened by the federal government while more interest and support must be considered by the state government. Connecticut officials, especially lawmakers, need to revisit the impact of federal cuts and reforms affecting graduate education and funding in the near future.  As federal support declines, more interest and investment will be needed to protect opportunities for our residents and maintain a strong, competitive workforce.
Our state has long been a national leader in public education. Let’s not undermine that progress. Our region should be an exemplary model for higher education and Connecticut must lead the way.  The future of our workforce, and the strength of our communities, depend on graduate education. Public universities like SCSU are mission-driven to serve local communities and advance social mobility. If these federal provisions pass as proposed, they will force institutions to make difficult choices about which programs can survive and more devastatingly–whom they can afford to serve. This threatens to widen inequities deprive universities of their flexibility in meet Connecticut’s ability to meet its workforce development goals.
Higher education should not become a field where working adults and aspiring professionals are collateral damage. We need policy solutions that expand opportunities, not limit them. We also need funding models that recognize the long-term value of investing in a graduate-educated workforce, especially in a state like ours where economic competitiveness depends on it and preventing a problematic brain drain.
Connecticut cannot afford to let shortsighted federal policy undermine the pipeline of skilled professionals we need. Graduate education is the backbone of a thriving, inclusive, and innovative workforce in Connecticut.  Everyone who cares about our economy, our schools, our healthcare systems, and our communities should pay attention to what’s at stake. We must stay informed and ready to speak up for accessible, equitable, and affordable graduate education for all.

(Photo Courtesy of the Navajo Nation Police Department)Hundreds of residents in several communities on the Navajo Nation are under evacuation orders as the Oak Ridge Fire, which has zero containment near Window Rock, continues to spread.
As of Tuesday, just three days after the fire began, more than 350 people had been evacuated.
The fire, eight miles southwest of Window Rock, had burned 9,847 acres, according to the Southwest Area Incident Management Team 2, a national emergency management organization.
The incident team reported on Tuesday morning that the fire was pushed six miles to the west in just a few hours on Monday night, and “200-foot flames were reported as the fire covered the length of two football fields in a matter of minutes.”
Due to the intense shift in the fire on Monday night, firefighters were pulled back and did not reengage the fire until conditions improved, according to the incident team’s update on Tuesday morning.
Fire crews on the northeast section of the fire are monitoring the firelines that have been established over the last few days to ensure they will continue to hold.
The east section of the blaze is being monitored by structure protection groups, who are continuing their work to secure structures with the intention of allowing people to return to their homes.
At the south end of the fire, the incident team reported that it is not expected to spread, but it will continue to burn any available fuel within the area.
For the west portion of the fire, “crews are utilizing and strengthening roads and natural fire breaks to contain potential fire spread.”
Airtankers will continue to be used to support the ground operations, according to the incident team.
Monday night town hall
The Oak Ridge Fire was initially reported on June 28 by a Navajo Nation police officer, according to the Office of the Navajo Nation President.
Two wood haulers were cutting fresh oak in the area when a small fire started, according to officials. The fire quickly spread due to the wind.
The cause of the fire is still under investigation by the BIA; but it is driven by wind and fueled by grass, undergrowth and timber.
Because of the severity of the fire, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Complex Incident Management Team and Southwest Area Incident Management Team 2 have assumed operational control from the Navajo Nation’s initial incident command team, and they are now managing the response efforts for the fire.
“Your folks did a great job with the initial attack when it started,” said Rocky Gilbert, a chief for the Southwest Area Incident Management Team.
“We’ve been using airtankers all day,” he said, adding that they have been battling the wind.
Most of the fire containment efforts are focused on the western section of the fire, near the Transwestern Pipeline, County Road and Indian Route 201.
Gilbert said crews were set up behind the El Paso Gas Substation, Hunters Point, and the Saint Michaels area surrounding Indian Route 201, with dedicated crews in the area to protect structures.
“There are 350 firefighters out on the fire line fighting the fire,” Morse said, and officials have asked for 10 more crews and engines.
John Truett, incident commander for the incident management team, said that they have only been in the area for a day, but they feel welcomed by the community.
He added that officials are working on a plan to address the fire that will work for everyone.
“We know that this is very sacred ground, so we don’t want to go out and destroy anything,” Truett said.
“Our fire line is not going to affect any of the sensitive areas out there,” he added.
Navajo Nation Police Lt. Tyler Lynch, serving as the incident commander for the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management, provided an update to the community during the town hall meeting Monday night.
Lynch wanted to remind the community that they are operating under the “Ready, Set, Go!” system, a nationwide preparation program.
“Ready” means being prepared and aware of the hazards threatening the area. “Set” means to remain alert and recognize that there is significant danger nearby. “Go” means it is time to evacuate, and the danger in the area is imminent and life-threatening.
“Having a plan is important,” Lynch said, and he shared an updated map with the community that showed which areas surrounding the Oak Ridge Fire were in “Ready, Set, Go!” stages.
As of Monday night, two areas were under “Go” evacuation orders, four areas were under “Set,” and one was under “Ready.” Several communities lie within the boundaries of these evacuation zones, including Hunters Point, Saint Michael’s, Oak Springs, Pine Spring, Klagatoh and Cross Canyon.
“We have evacuated 100 families,” Lynch said. There are community health representatives and police officers actively checking on families in the area.
Resources available for those impacted 
The Navajo Nation Council is urging residents to be vigilant and follow all emergency protocols and evacuation alerts as emergency personnel continue to fight the Oak Ridge Fire.
“The Oak Ridge Fire is an emergency that is threatening our rangelands, public and residential structures, and livestock,” Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said in a press release.
Curley said the Navajo Nation Council is receiving reports that residents in the affected areas are choosing to stay in their homes, despite evacuation alerts intensifying.
“We ask all community members to not act in haste and to prioritize their safety given the growing fire,” she said.
An evacuation shelter has been established at the Bee Hółdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center in Fort Defiance and donations of things like new towels and bedding, shade structure, nonperishable food and baby supplies are being accepted there.
Monday night, the Navajo Nation Department announced that the Ganado Fieldhouse will be open as shelter for residents in and around the Klagetoh pump station area. The area is under “Go” evacuation status after the fire shifted due to strong winds.
“It’s a shock for many of our people being asked to evacuate,” Curley said. “They’re in shock, but we have to do what we can to provide these resources.”
During the town hall meeting, Curley said multiple resources are available at the Bee Hółdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center, including shelter, food, water, and counseling or mental health services.
Families who have animals are being directed to the Navajo Nation Department of Agriculture for livestock evacuation assistance. For smaller animals, they are directed to the Navajo Nation Department of Education.
Navajo Nation officials are urging the public not to park or travel near the fire, as they continue to encounter people trying to take pictures and videos of the fire.
“You can get in the way of our fire team,” BIA Navajo Regional Director Deborah Shirley said during the town hall meeting.
She said that they will have a team in the area to ensure no one interferes with firefighting efforts.
People coming into the area to shoot video and photos are creating unnecessary traffic, Curley said.
“Safety is number one,” she said, adding that people need to stay clear of the area around the fire. “Only our first responders and direct family members should be in that area.”
Curley also advised Navajo people to depend on official sources for information about the wildfire.
She said that those looking for updates should get them from the official social media pages of the Navajo departments in charge, because misinformation is being spread on social media.
“We need to stay calm and alert,” she said.
The Navajo Nation does not have an official GoFundMe page set up and is not accepting monetary donations, Curley said.
“Be aware of scams,” she added.
Navajo Nation declares state of emergency
Due to the severity of the Oak Ridge Fire, the Navajo Nation Commission on Emergency Management declared a state of emergency on June 28, requesting additional resources to address the wildfire impacts.
The declaration enables the immediate allocation of critical resources and operational support, CEM Chair Marcarlo Roanhorse said in a press release.
“We express deep appreciation to the firefighters, law enforcement, emergency personnel, and volunteers working on the front lines,” Roanhorse said. “As a Commission, we stand ready to support our Nation through this challenging time with diligence, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to public safety.”
Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren signed an executive order enacting more robust Stage 2 fire restrictions due to the heightened wildfire risk.
Some of those restrictions are a prohibition on all open flames, including campfires and charcoal use, even in designated recreation areas, as well as operating chainsaws or other internal combustion engines.
As part of the emergency declaration, the Navajo Nation will activate available resources, including funding for personnel, equipment, and other support, to restore and maintain critical community infrastructure.
The declaration states that all Navajo Nation divisions, departments, programs, and chapters must coordinate emergency responses, allocate resources, and carry out response actions in partnership with federal, state, and tribal entities to address the needs of affected communities.
Donation drives for families impacted
Navajo woman Janell Brown and her daughter, Rayleigh Billy, saw the massive amount of smoke in the area while driving through Window Rock on June 28.
Brown, 32, said that her daughter pointed out the smoke in the distance. They were concerned about it, later learning that it was the Oak Ridge Fire.
“It’s so close to home,” Brown said. Her family lives in Navajo, New Mexico, which is about 25 minutes north of Window Rock. “It makes us sad with how many people had to up and leave and they couldn’t take anything.”
With the fire being so close, Brown said her daughter wanted to do something for the community.
“It’s really sad to me that they have to leave everything,” Billy said, adding that the experience of leaving their home will affect them.
“I’m sorry,” she said. “I’ll keep praying for them to get home.”
Billy, 11, is the 2024-2025 Miss Navajo Elementary. As a way to help the community, Billy and her mother hosted a donation drive at the Navajo Pine Market in Navajo on Monday.
“She’s representing her community,” Brown said. “We’re just trying to make a little impact and I know it will make a big difference for them.”
Brown and Billy collected monetary donations, cases of water, baby wipes, tissue, toothpaste and toothbrushes during their donation drive. They plan on hosting another one July 2.
Brown said that they plan to use the monetary donations to purchase necessities that have been requested for donation.
The mother-daughter team will be taking the donations to the Navajo Nation’s designated donation spot at the Bee Hółdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center, where they have been volunteering.
Multiple efforts are underway to collect donations for the families affected by the Oak Ridge Fire, including several in the Valley.
The Phoenix Indian Center is accepting donations through July 3 and plans to make its first delivery on July 2. Donations can be dropped off at 4041 N. Central Ave. in Phoenix.
Native Health Phoenix locations are accepting donations at three sites. There are two Phoenix locations: 4041 N Central Ave. and 8800 N. 22nd Ave., and one Mesa location: 777 W. Southern Ave.
The donated items will be delivered to the St. Michaels Chapter starting July 2, according to Native Health’s Facebook page, with additional deliveries on July 3 and July 4.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the Oak Ridge Fire,” they stated in their post. “We send our gratitude to those that are fighting the fire and those working behind the scenes to assist the community.”

A group of 33 parents, teachers and faith leaders on Tuesday asked the state’s highest court to block the controversial new standards, which will dictate what topics public schools must teach in social studies classes starting in the 2025-26 academic year. They requested Oklahoma’s previous social studies standards, enacted in 2019, be reinstated until a new version is validly approved.
The plaintiffs contend the pro-Bible standards are unenforceable because they would unconstitutionally impose Christian beliefs on public-school students. The lawsuit also claims the Oklahoma State Board of Education failed to uphold state law when approving the standards on Feb. 27. Half of the board’s sitting members said they were unaware at the time of the vote that the standards contained significant changes from an earlier draft shared with the public.
Another lawsuit, which a judge dismissed in Oklahoma County District Court, made a similar argument that the state Board of Education didn’t follow proper procedures when it approved the standards. Former Attorney General Mike Hunter filed the case on behalf of a different group of Oklahoma parents, grandparents and teachers, and he said he intends to appeal his case to the state Supreme Court.
The plaintiffs who filed the latest lawsuit on Tuesday are represented by attorneys from the national organization Americans United for Separation of Church and State and a local advocacy group, the Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.
“Our lawsuit defends educational integrity and the public’s right to open, accountable government, and it defends the family as the source of the child’s religious upbringing,” Oklahoma Appleseed legal director Brent Rowland said in a statement.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education did not immediately return a request for comment.
With the start of the next school year approaching in August, the plaintiffs asked the state Supreme Court to temporarily prevent the new standards from taking effect while the case is pending.

Some of the plaintiffs, along with Americans United attorneys, sued last year to block a mandate from state Superintendent Ryan Walters that all public schools teach from the Bible and keep a copy in every classroom. That case is still pending before the state Supreme Court. 
Walters has since used state funds to purchase over 500 copies of the Bible to distribute to schools.
The new social studies standards, which Walters’ administration developed at the state Department of Education, would require elementary students to learn Bible stories and Jesus’ teachings “that influenced the American colonists, founders and culture.” 
In fifth and eighth grades, students would have to learn the Judeo-Christian values that influenced America’s founders.
Walters has said biblical instruction is essential to ensure students understand more context of American history.
But, the plaintiffs contend this infringes on their religious freedom and their legal right to direct their children’s moral and religious upbringing. Most of the plaintiffs are not raising their children in a particular religion, or they have different Christian and Jewish beliefs from what the new standards include, according to their lawsuit.
The lead plaintiff is a Baptist minister, the Rev. Mitch Randall, of Norman.
“To reduce the Bible to a history book – rather than treating it as a theological text – does a disservice to public school students, their families, their teachers and those who consider the Bible to be a book of faith,” Randall said in a statement.
Randall and the plaintiffs also objected to parts of the standards that present disputed claims about the 2020 presidential election and COVID-19.

The standards suggest there were “discrepancies” in the results of the 2020 election, including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
This language, along with Walters’ public statements that Trump “should have won” the 2020 race, “make clear that the 2025 standards are intended to promote the view that Donald Trump was the true winner of the 2020 presidential election,” the lawsuit contends.
Walters has said the standards weren’t written to support a specific viewpoint on the election, but rather to encourage students to make their own conclusions.
The case also points to a statement in the standards that the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic was a Chinese laboratory, which the plaintiffs say lacks scientific consensus.
“As a Christian, I object to Oklahoma’s new social studies standards that require teachers to deceive students by presenting inaccurate information as fact,” Randall said.

Ken Paxton, Attorney General of Texas.” (Photo by Luke Johnson for The Texas Tribune)Texas’ law requiring Pornhub and other adult websites to verify users’ ages is constitutional and can remain in effect, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Friday.
The case stems from a 2023 law, HB 1181, that required websites to verify that a user is over the age of 18 if more than one-third of their content is considered harmful to minors. A group of adult entertainment websites sued, arguing this violated free speech and privacy protections.
Texas countered that the state had a right to protect children with what Solicitor General Aaron Nielson framed as “simple, safe and common” restrictions.
A similar case was brought in Florida in December just weeks before the law was set to go into effect on Jan. 1.
The Florida case was brought by the Free Speech Coalition and challenges the law requiring websites with “material harmful to minors” to verify the age of its users. The coalition argued that it is a content-based restriction, violating the First Amendment, among other concerns.
In January, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker paused the case, waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to make a decision on the Texas case. No updates on the case have been issued by the district court.
While the Supreme Court justices seemed divided on the free speech issues in the Texas case, a 6-3 majority of the Court ultimately sided with Texas, finding that requiring age verification “is within a State’s authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content.”
The 2023 law “is an exercise of Texas’s traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority’s opinion. “To the extent that it burdens adults’ rights to access such speech, it has ‘only an incidental effect on protected speech,’ making it subject to intermediate scrutiny.”
The Court’s three liberal justices dissented, arguing that the law should have been held to the higher standard of strict scrutiny, the most stringent level of legal review used in cases related to fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech. The dissenting judges also argued that while states have a “compelling interest” in protecting children from obscene speech, doing so sometimes impeded the right of adults to access that speech.
In her dissent, which was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Kentanji Brown Jackson, Justice Elena Kagan said that Texas’ law might well have passed strict scrutiny and used the least restrictive means to achieve its goals.
“But what if Texas could do better — what if Texas could achieve its interest without so interfering with adults’ constitutionally protected rights in viewing the speech HB 1181 covers?” Kagan wrote. “The State should be foreclosed from restricting adults’ access to protected speech if that is not in fact necessary.”
Age verification 
Texas’ law requires people visiting websites “more than one-third of which is sexual material harmful to minors” to show they are over 18 by submitting digital identification, uploading government-issued identification or by using a “commercially reasonable method,” such as their banking information. Neither the website nor the party performing the verification can retain identifying information. Sites that violate the law face fines of up to $10,000 a day.
The law was passed amid a broader push in Texas and other states to prevent children from being exposed to sexual materials, which continued this legislative session. Friday’s ruling could have implications for more than a dozen states that have passed similar laws.
It was not the first time that these Texas bills have tested the boundaries of free speech protections: In two cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws aimed to prevent the distribution of obscene materials to minors unconstitutionally restricted free speech.
Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling Friday, calling it a “major victory for children, parents and the ability of states to protect minors from the damaging effects of online pornography.”
“Companies have no right to expose children to pornography and must institute reasonable age verification measures,” Paxton said. “I will continue to enforce the law against any organization that refuses to take the necessary steps to protect minors from explicit materials.”
Civil liberties groups decried the decision as a rollback of free speech protections.
“Today’s ruling limits American adults’ access to only that speech which is fit for children — unless they show their papers first,” Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in a statement. “Data breaches are inevitable. How many will it take before we understand the threat today’s ruling presents? Americans will live to regret the day we let the government condition access to protected speech on proof of our identity.”
The Free Speech Coalition, a legal advocacy group representing the adult film industry, responded to Friday’s ruling by arguing pornography is the “canary in the coal mine of free expression.”
“The government should not have the right to demand that we sacrifice our privacy and security to use the internet,” Executive Director Alison Boden wrote in a statement. “This law has failed to keep minors away from sexual content yet continues to have a massive chilling effect on adults. The outcome is disastrous for Texans and for anyone who cares about freedom of speech and privacy online.”
Critics of Texas’ law raised privacy concerns and said it could make it dangerous for adults to access legal content. Critics also argued HB 1181 was overly broad and could apply to websites providing resources on reproductive health, sex education and LGBTQ+ issues.
“The legislature claims to be protecting children from sexually explicit materials, but the law will do little to block their access, and instead deters adults from viewing vast amounts of First Amendment-protected content,” wrote Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the Free Speech Coalition in court.
The day before the law was set to go into effect in 2023, a U.S. district judge put it on hold, granting a request for a temporary injunction filed by the Free Speech Coalition.
‘Most intimate and personal aspects’
Federal District Judge David Alan Ezra, a Ronald Reagan appointee, said in granting the injunction that the law would allow the government “to peer into the most intimate and personal aspects of people’s lives,” imposing a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech.
The state appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which allowed the law to take effect. In March 2024, the appeals court upheld most of the law, but struck down a requirement that these websites post a “health warning,” saying that pornography is addictive and weakens brain function.
The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in July 2024 and heard arguments earlier this year on whether the appeals court applied proper legal reasoning in upholding age-verification.
The pornography websites’ claims attracted support from a wide cross-section of advocacy groups, from librarians to libertarians, who cited concerns about the ripple effects of Texas’ law. The Biden administration also submitted an amicus brief in support of overturning the law.
Meanwhile, some websites, including Pornhub, have suspended services in Texas, saying they are unable to comply with the law. In a statement that greets users who try to access the website in Texas, Pornhub says that “providing identification every time you want to visit an adult platform is not an effective solution for protecting users online, and in fact, will put minors and your privacy at risk.”
“As we’ve seen in other states, such bills have failed to protect minors, by driving users from those few websites which comply, to the hundreds of thousands of websites with far fewer safety measures in place, which do not comply,” the statement says.

North Carolina’s latest high-profile energy legislation, Senate Bill 266, will cost $23 billion.
The misleadingly named “Power Bill Reduction Act,” has passed both the state House and Senate, and now awaits action from Governor Stein. In it, lawmakers overhauled state law in multiple ways to benefit North Carolina’s largest corporations while increasing utility bills for households across our state. A more accurate moniker would be the “Bill for Higher Energy Bills,” if you’re talking about utility bills for people like you and me.
New analysis posted June 30th by researchers at NC State University finds that the bill’s signature provision — removing the state’s 2030 carbon emissions reduction target — is projected to lead to a $23 billion increase in fuel costs through 2050. Based on modeling by the Utilities Commission Public Staff, the research team found that eliminating the interim target would increase natural gas generation by nearly 40 percent between 2030 and 2050. Researchers conclude maintaining the interim goal helps limit exposure to volatile fuel markets and protects ratepayers from sharp increases in electricity bills. 
SB 266 has multiple provisions that work together to maximize profit, shift financial risk to customers, and leave North Carolina households holding the bag. 
On a path to high fuel costs 
In 2021, House Bill 951 became North Carolina law with bipartisan support, mandating a goal of 70% carbon emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. SB 266 would undermine that bipartisan effort by eliminating the interim 2030 carbon reduction target. 
The NCSU professors confirmed that eliminating the interim carbon target will nearly double the amount of natural gas on the Duke Energy electricity grid. Natural gas is already raising our electricity bills. An analysis of Duke Energy’s filings with the NC Utilities Commision shows that in the Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) service territory, fuel costs account for roughly 67% of the increase in residential retail rates since 2017, making the portion of the rate increases attributable to fuel costs more than double the amount from all other rate comments.
Forcing customers to prepay for power plants
Next, the bill weakens consumer protections by requiring North Carolina customers to pay up front for the interest on the construction of large natural gas power plants before they are built or operational. The financial risk for these large construction projects would be shifted from the utility shareholders onto North Carolina families and businesses. 
If the construction project goes exactly as planned, paying construction costs before the project is complete spreads the costs over a longer time, lowering the rate of increase in month-to-month bills. But if the construction project goes over budget or is never completed, which they often do, ratepayers would be stuck paying all of the expenses for the project without receiving any benefit in return, while the utility shareholders still profit. This is a lesson we learned from South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, where ratepayers are now burdened with paying for power plants that were never finished or went billions over budget.
Not surprisingly, when asked in a recent poll conducted by Conservatives for Clean Energy, 85% of North Carolinians said they oppose this type of upfront customer financing model.
Shifting the cost burden from business customers onto residential customers
Not only will SB 266 lead to greater natural gas usage, but the legislation will force North Carolina households to pay a greater portion of those natural gas costs by changing the way fuel costs are allocated between the rate classes (residential, commercial, and industrial customers). This is true when looking back at 2024 data and when considering future trends. 
The Public Staff referenced past fuel costs and estimated that under similar conditions, SB 266 would shift, at a minimum, $24.8 million a year of fuel costs from large commercial customers onto North Carolina households and families.
But the cost shifted onto residential customers will likely be even greater than that bare minimum. For Duke Energy Carolinas, purchased power costs nearly doubled over a three-year period, from $282 million in 2023, to $400 million in 2024, to $575 million in 2025. 
Incorporating the trend of increasing power purchase costs into the model, analysts at the firm EQ Research found the cost shift from industry to households would total a projected $78 million a year.  This means that each North Carolina household will pay higher bills so that a handful of large commercial customers can pay substantially less.
Deceptive messaging and the rushed legislative process
In legislative committee hearings, when asked about the impacts of the bill on utility rates, supporters of the bill deliberately misled their colleagues, saying it would reduce energy costs and help poor people struggling to pay their energy bills. Importantly, legislators were asked to vote on the bill before comprehensive analysis of the cost impacts could be reviewed or considered. Now that the NC State University analysis is available, everyone can see what a raw deal this legislation is for the people of North Carolina. 
Residential customers, especially North Carolinians with low incomes, are the people who can least afford to absorb these energy cost increases. They are also the constituency least likely to have professional lobbyists watching out for their interests on Jones Street. 
With the data in, we see that SB 266, the “Power Bill Reduction Act” raises bills, risks our future, and helps no one but Duke Energy and its business customers.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electric-meter-Getty-Stock.jpg,,,2025-07-01 14:11:17.536988

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge sided with state officials and allowed a Kansas law to go into effect that bans “foreign nationals” from contributing financially to campaigns for or against state constitutional amendments.
A Kansas advocacy group, backed by a Washington, D.C., law firm, challenged state officials in May and attempted to stop the law from going into effect July 1. U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree denied the group’s request to block the law Monday in a 37-page decision.
He said the group, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, “is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim.”
Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which has accepted such funds directly and indirectly in the past, plans to advocate against a planned constitutional amendment that will ask voters in August 2026 if they want to change the way Kansas Supreme Court justices are selected. The group has already secured funding to do just that.
The law, House Bill 2106, was passed in April. It changes the Kansas Campaign Finance Act to prohibit accepting foreign funds, which includes money from donors who accept foreign funds, and using that money in activities that promote or oppose a constitutional amendment in Kansas. The group argued that the law was broad, vague and infringed upon constitutionally protected political speech.
Crabtree agreed with the state that ballot issues, particularly constitutional amendments, “shape the state’s most foundational document,” he wrote in the decision. But he also acknowledged the potential for HB 2106 to be “an unnecessary and paternalistic limit on which ideas get to compete in the marketplace of ideas.”
“Perhaps,” Crabtree wrote, “it’d be better, as KCF suggests, to allow Kansas voters to hear different perspectives — from many diverse sources — and trust the voters to make a choice for themselves.”
However, “whether wise or unwise policy,” the government has a genuine interest in limiting foreign influence in democratic self-government, he said.
The lawsuit named nine members of the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission; the commission’s executive director, Wade Wiebe; and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who can bring criminal charges under HB 2106 against anyone who violates its provisions. The ethics commission, which is set to be renamed as the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission under a new law that takes effect in July, is able to bring civil action against those who violate HB 2106.
Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which played a major role in the 2022 campaign against an amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion, interpreted the law as a pointed hindrance to its ability to play such a role in the future. The group spent $11 million in its opposition to the 2022 abortion amendment, and it said in its initial lawsuit filing that members had already secured funding to oppose the August 2026 constitutional amendment. 
State officials, on the other hand, argued in a court filing that HB 2106 is in the public interest.
“The interest is as compelling as it is utterly foundational: the sovereignty of the people of Kansas and the legitimacy of the democratic processes ensuring that sovereignty,” the filing said.
Other courts have dealt with the same question of foreign financial influence, arriving at similar conclusions to Crabtree.
Any person involved in campaigning for or against an amendment is required under existing law to submit a series of campaign finance reports. From July 1 on, organizations and individuals planning to engage in advocacy for or against a constitutional amendment must certify they haven’t received more than $100,000 from foreign nationals in the preceding four years. Any person or group who has received such funds is barred from participating in constitutional advocacy for up to four years.
The state’s definition of foreign national excludes people in the U.S. with permanent legal status and U.S. entities, unless they are wholly or majority-owned by a foreign national.
At a June hearing, attorneys for state officials clarified that any money Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, or other groups, accepted before the law’s effective date would not fall under the purview of the new law.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Topeka-federal-court-house-4--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-01 14:11:17.536988

(LinkedIN and Federalist Society)After a five-month search, President Donald Trump nominated two Hoosiers to serve as U.S. Attorneys for Indiana’s Northern and Southern Districts, the White House confirmed. 
Trump tapped Adam Mildred, a longtime deputy prosecutor from Allen County, to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana. Mildred has led more than 200 prosecutions since taking office in 2000. 
For the Southern District, Trump selected Thomas Wheeler II, who currently serves as Acting General Counsel at the Department of Education. His prior positions include Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice, Senior Advisor to the White House School Safety Commission, and Counsel to the Secretary of Education. He also was a partner at Bose McKinney & Evans LLP, an Indianapolis law firm. 
Both terms last four years, and they must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Alongside the nominations, Trump named Scott Proctor as Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana. Previously, he worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Oklahoma. 
U.S. attorneys represent the federal government in litigation and serve as the chief federal law enforcement officers in their districts.
Indiana U.S. Sen. Jim Banks praised the president’s nominees in a statement released Monday. 
“President Trump nominated two strong candidates to be the U.S. Attorneys for Indiana. Adam Mildred and Tom Wheeler have decades of experience and are deeply committed to upholding law and order. They both will bring integrity to the job and I look forward to voting for their confirmation soon. I’m also grateful for Acting U.S. Attorney Scott Proctor’s service to Indiana during this time,” Banks said. 
U.S. Sen. Todd Young added his thoughts on Tuesday — “Adam Mildred’s and Thomas Wheeler’s experience and expertise would make them assets to the Northern and Southern Districts of Indiana. I look forward to supporting both individuals through their confirmation process.”
Traditionally, U.S. Attorneys resign at the start of a new administration. Former U.S. Attorney’s Clifford Johnson and Zachary Myers stepped down before Trump took office Jan. 20. Acting Attorneys John Childress and Tina Nommay have filled the roles since then.

He said his first trip there was in 2022 with a delegation aiming to establish a government-to-government connection between the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, to demonstrate that despite the separate land bases, the spirits of the Seminole people remain as strong as they were in 1832.After learning about the proposed migrant detention center, often referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz,” Jake Tiger recognized that history is repeating itself. Tiger, a cultural specialist for the Seminole Nation, noted similarities between escalating immigrant detentions and the Holocaust concentration camps, as well as the U.S. Indian Removal Act of 1830.
“All of us historians understand we’re starting to draw these parallels where they’re coming in and wanting to take brown people, and they call them ‘illegals,’” Tiger said. “You know, no one can be illegal on stolen land. And so when we see that, that’s just a clear case of colonial oppression. …And for them to take our sacred lands and just dispose of it and put these monuments of white supremacy, I do not stand for that.”
Tiger’s tribal nation, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, is joining forces with the two federally recognized tribes in Florida in the fight against Ron DeSantis and Florida’s rapid efforts to build a migrant detention center set to house 5,000 beds. The center is currently under construction in the Big Cypress region of Florida, near the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier shared a video on X, proposing the immigration crackdown project and the attractive features of this specific location.
“This 30-square-foot mile area is completely surrounded by the Everglades. It presents an efficient, low-cost opportunity to build a temporary detention facility because you don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter,” Uthmeier said in the video. “If people get out, there’s not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons.”
The Miccosukee Tribe’s Chairman highlighted what Uthmeier’s message is missing: the lands are much more than an appealing site for an immigrant holding center; the lands hold American Indian history and are adjacent to 19 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages.
“Rather than Miccosukee homelands being an uninhabited wasteland for alligators and pythons, as some have suggested, the Big Cypress is the Tribe’s traditional homelands,” Miccosukee Tribal Chairman Talbert Cypress said in a statement. “The landscape has protected the Miccosukee and Seminole people for generations.”
Tiger said the Seminole people come from various groups— the Miccosukee, Muskogean and Hitchiti, among others— and had traditional homelands in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. He explained that his ancestors knew no borders, migrating between the different areas due to weather conditions, such as hurricanes and frigid winters.
Yet, because of the U.S. government’s removal policies toward American Indians, many Seminoles living in the southeast were violently forced to relocate to Oklahoma. Now, they make up the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. Those who were able to resist the forced removal by living in Florida’s swamps still live in Florida and are known today as the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
“There were a lot of Seminole people who utilized the Florida Everglades as a home ground, to take shelter and evade removal and war because it was hard for a lot of the Army, Marines and Navy to traverse through the Florida Everglades,” Tiger said. “But we already knew how to get in around there.”
Seminole Nation of Oklahoma Chief Lewis Johnson also emphasized the importance of the area for its historical significance, symbolism and the ecosystems dependent on the health of the land.
“These lands are not empty stretches of wilderness, nor are they merely backdrops to policy decisions—they are living, breathing homelands, deeply tied to the cultural, spiritual and historical identity of Miccosukee and Florida and Seminole people,” Johnson said in a statement.
In 2022, Tiger visited Florida for the first time and struggled to describe his experience of seeing the Everglades, largely due to the landscape’s breathtaking beauty. He could tell that the wildlife was being cared for, but he worried about its future.
“We’re seeing this massive push of the total lack of respect for these lands that have always been here,” Tiger said. “We call ourselves the free world. To us, that’s just a clear case of colonialism that’s still being oppressed upon the first American people here in North America. …What I’m trying to explain to people is when the whole forest has been cut down and our waters have been polluted, we will then understand you cannot eat a dollar or drink oil.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Michigan Republicans cheered the U.S. Senate’s passage of the new congressional spending bill on Tuesday, which includes tax breaks and spending cuts that Michigan Democrats have warned would mean disaster for the state budget and a whole host of social programs.
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday in a narrow 51-50 vote – one that needed Vice President JD Vance to break the tie – passed President Donald Trump’s signature spending plan and kicked it back to the U.S. House of Representatives where it hopes to reach final passage before Friday, July 4.
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) posted on X to sing the bill’s praises, including Republican beliefs that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would stop tipped workers from being taxed on their tips and that it would expand the Child Tax Credit.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“When President Trump first introduced the Child Tax Credit, it was a game changer for working families,” James said on X. “Now, we have the opportunity to lock in and boost the doubled Child Tax Credit for more than 40 million families with the One Big Beautiful Bill!”
U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), chair of the U.S. House GOP Caucus, posted on X that Republicans were ready to get the bill to Trump’s desk, warning that further Republican dissension in the House – which stalled passage initially in both chambers – would break “the promise made to the American people” by the GOP and Trump.
“The time is now,” she wrote. “Failure is not an option.”
Meanwhile, Michigan Democrats in Washington unilaterally slammed the bill.
U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield) said in a statement that the bill would add more than $3 trillion to the national deficit, increase skyrocketing national debt and take away health care and food assistance from millions of Americans – including hundreds of thousands of Michiganders – in order to give tax cuts to billionaires.
“The bill that Republicans just passed will rip health care away from hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, make it harder for families across the country to afford food and pay their energy bills, and balloon our deficit by trillions of dollars,” Peters said. “Democrats did everything in our power to stop this legislation, but President Trump and Republicans in Congress are dead set on selling out hardworking Michiganders so they can pay for a massive tax cut for billionaires. This bill is reckless, irresponsible, and an unconscionable betrayal of American families.”
Peters noted that he voted against the bill.
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) said that after more than 25 hours on the Senate floor, she also voted no.
“No matter which way you slice it – health care, energy, housing – the President just rammed through a bill that will make Michiganders pay in every part of their lives. All so the wealthiest among us can get a tax break,” Slotkin said in a statement. “Today’s massive bill will go through only with a tie breaker. Senate Democrats importantly delayed the process enough to allow the world to see this bill and to lay bare the fighting and divisions on the other side.”
Slotkin added that she believed history would not be kind to the bill, nor Republicans who voted for it. She also said it was important to remember that the deal is not quite done, as it needs to be passed again by the U.S. House. But with Republicans in control of all levels of the federal government, the bill is likely to pass despite some dissent from staunch Republican budget Hawks in the lower chamber.
Still, Slotkin called for constituents to call their representatives and make their opposition to the bill heard.
“Keep pushing,” Slotkin said.
The Michigan Democratic Party in a statement said the federal budget, if passed, would abandon Michigan workers.
“Millions of Michiganders will see their costs go up thanks to Republicans in DC choosing to help billionaires over working families,” said Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtus Hertel Jr. in a statement. “Republicans are trying to gut Medicaid and SNAP programs and put thousands of jobs, and even more lives, at risk as hospitals are forced to close and families lose coverage.”
Hertel added that the budget bill was not only “cruel,” but was “stupid and a financial disaster for our state and the whole country.”
“This bill is a betrayal of the American Dream that has been promised to generations as Republicans crush working families to benefit the ultra wealthy,” Hertel said.
Groups like the Michigan League of Conservation Voters also decried passage of the bill, calling it a “dangerous, shameful giveaway to fossil fuel companies and corporate polluters that sacrifices Michigan families, our economy and our environment.”
“This bill is a scorched-earth assault on the health, wallets and future of every Michigander,” said Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for Michigan LCV. “At a time when families are battling rising costs, dangerous air pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change, Senate Republicans chose to side with billionaire polluters over the people they were elected to serve. This is legislative malpractice of the highest order.”
Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy, called it “staggering” that Senate Republicans had passed a budget bill that would strip health care and food away from millions of Americans, including hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, in order to provide tax benefits for the wealthiest U.S. households and corporations.
“For Michigan, that means the state will have to come up with $8.5 billion in Medicaid expansion costs and up to $304 million in SNAP costs that the bill strips away from our state budget. It means 123,000 Michiganders are at risk of losing food assistance, and over 700,000 are at risk of losing health care. These are our friends, our neighbors and our families,” Stanton said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222293549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 14:11:17.536988

Gov. JB Pritzker announced Tuesday that former Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell will be his running mate for the 2026 campaign.

Pritzker’s selection, made just days after announcing a third campaign for governor, comes from a close circle of trust in Pritzker’s administration. Mitchell previously served in the governor’s office as one of four deputy governors overseeing key projects in Pritzker’s first term.

“Christian Mitchell is a proven leader with deep experience, steady judgment, and an unshakable commitment to the working families of Illinois,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Whether it’s transforming our clean energy future, rebuilding our infrastructure, or keeping our communities safe, Christian has been a force behind so much of our progress. I couldn’t ask for a better partner to continue delivering results for the people of Illinois.”

Mitchell, 38, will replace Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on the ticket as she seeks the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.

Mitchell comes in with hefty experience in state government and public policy. A resident of Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood, Mitchell served three terms in the Illinois House beginning in 2013 and was executive director of the Democratic Party of Illinois in 2018 before joining the governor’s office in 2019.

Lieutenant governor role

Mitchell left Pritzker’s administration in early 2023 to become vice president for civic engagement at the University of Chicago where he oversees government relations. Mitchell was appointed by Pritzker last year to an unpaid seat on the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority board, which oversees Navy Pier and McCormick Place. He is also a first lieutenant in the Illinois Air National Guard.

“The governor has led with courage and compassion, and together we’ve built a foundation that’s moving Illinois forward,” Mitchell said in a statement. “I’m ready to build on that progress — lowering costs, expanding opportunity, and making sure every community has the resources and opportunities they deserve. This is about delivering real results for the people of Illinois, and I’m excited to get to work.”

Though the lieutenant governor has few constitutional responsibilities in Illinois, Pritzker has leveraged the position to task Stratton with leading key legislative initiatives and overseeing the implementation of some of his administration’s top priorities at state agencies.

If Pritzker is elected to another term, the role will hold greater importance as Pritzker considers running for president in 2028. Pritzker’s election to the presidency would require Mitchell to serve the final two years of his term.

While keeping Mitchell's selection under wraps, Pritzker told reporters in recent days he was looking for a running mate who was ready to immediately step into the governorship if required.

“The number one qualification is, ‘can you do the job of being governor because if you’re lieutenant governor, that may come to you,’” Pritzker said Monday.

“The second thing I think about is person who I might choose for lieutenant governor somebody who has a heart for all the people of Illinois, not just some or some specific segment of the population because we have a big, diverse state,” he said.

Deputy governor role

Deputy governors in Pritzker's administration have a chief of staff-like role, overseeing specific policy areas and state agencies. Mitchell was in charge of environmental policy, infrastructure and public safety.

In 2020 and 2021, Mitchell oversaw the negotiations of Pritzker’s marquee climate policy — the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. It massively reformed the utility and energy industry and requires all fossil fuel power plants to close by 2045.

Mitchell was responsible for representing the governor in negotiations around the bill and was the face of the Pritzker administration as it went through the legislature.

That law, passed in the wake of a bribery scandal with Chicago’s electric utility that forced former House Speaker Michael Madigan to resign, cemented Pritzker’s reputation as a progressive on climate issues.

In the years since, energy experts and some lawmakers involved in passing the law have raised concerns that the state is at risk of missing the clean energy targets that Mitchell helped codify.

Mitchell also oversaw the implementation of the 2019 Rebuild Illinois capital plan – a $45 billion construction project to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure across the state.

Recreational cannabis regulation was also Mitchell’s responsibility. Pritzker signed legislation in his first year legalizing cannabis for recreational use and setting up a series of regulations for dispensaries and new social equity requirements.

Other experience

As a state lawmaker, Mitchell was chair of the House Economic Opportunity Committee.

Mitchell also brings heavy political experience to the ticket. Democrats swept races for statewide offices in 2018 and won supermajorities in the Statehouse with Mitchell serving in a top leadership role under former party Chair Mike Madigan. He took over for Tim Mapes, Madigan’s former chief of staff who was accused of sexual harassment and is now serving time in prison for a perjury conviction.

He has also worked as an advisor on several political campaigns in Illinois, including leading Midwest polling for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign.

Idaho officials sued over new law that blocks unauthorized immigrants from public services

U.S. District Judge Amanda Brailsford on Monday issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare from requiring citizenship status reviews for a federally funded HIV treatment program. 
The decision blocks the law’s application to this program until a court hearing in two weeks about whether the court should block the law for longer. 
The new law, House Bill 135, took effect Tuesday. It cuts the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. 
The judge’s ruling came days after ACLU of Idaho sued over the new law, alleging the law is unconstitutional by violating equal protection, conflicts with federal laws and even denies federal funds to people eligible under federal law.

ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.

“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.











We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics



The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.

‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

Seven states have enacted bans on lab-grown meat. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Texas is the fifth state this year and seventh overall to ban lab-grown meat after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation temporarily prohibiting the sale of cell-cultured protein.
Selling lab-grown meat, which is produced by growing cells acquired from living animals in a controlled environment, will be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the new law. It is set to go into effect in September and expires in two years.
“This ban is a massive win for Texas ranchers, producers, and consumers,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “Texans have a God-given right to know what’s on their plate, and for millions of Texans, it better come from a pasture, not a lab. It’s plain cowboy logic that we must safeguard our real, authentic meat industry from synthetic alternatives.”
Consumers interested in sustainable foods that avoid the slaughter of animals are driving the growing cultured meat industry.
The Texas beef industry supported the bill. The state leads the nation in cattle, contributing almost 15% of U.S. beef production, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Texas joins Indiana, Mississippi, Montana and Nebraska in enacting new laws this year; Alabama and Florida did so last year. In March, the Oklahoma House approved a similar bill that did not advance out of the Senate this session.
Texas followed Indiana’s lead in making its ban last for two years, which Indiana legislators said would allow more time for research. The time limit also may mean the law is less likely to draw legal challenges.
Upside Foods, one of the companies federally approved to sell cultivated meat, sued Florida shortly after the state passed the country’s first lab-grown meat ban. That lawsuit is pending.
In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave permission to two California-based companies to begin selling lab-produced chicken across the country. Their lab-grown chicken was briefly featured on the menu at two restaurants that same year.
Although cultivated meat isn’t sold in stores yet, some research suggests it could be better for the environment compared with traditional meat production.
But other research suggests lab-grown meat’s environmental impact could be higher than retail beef based on current production methods.

(Suzanne King/The Beacon)As federal funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs becomes less certain, the number of people newly diagnosed with the virus in the Kansas City region is trending up.
Provisional data from the Kansas City Health Department show that an 11-county region in Missouri and Kansas saw 227 new cases in 2024, up from 206 the previous year.
Sean Ryan, who oversees the department’s HIV programs, said this is the second year the number of new cases in the region has climbed.

The upward trend, which holds true nationally, can be traced in part to the COVID pandemic, when HIV testing and prevention programs went temporarily dormant, he said. Fewer people were screened, and since HIV symptoms can take years to show up, more people likely spread the virus unknowingly.
“We are seeing a bit of catch-up from those years and the (prevention) efforts that we lost,” Ryan said.
The gap in testing during the pandemic and the subsequent rise in new cases is an example of what could happen if federal funding wanes and HIV suppression work subsides.
The Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive budget bill now making its way through Congress, could reduce existing HIV funding. And cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of tax credits for supporting the Affordable Care Act marketplace could leave 16 million people uninsured, another blow to maintaining HIV treatment and prevention efforts.
“It stresses the importance of having continued services without a gap,” Ryan said, “because the second you step back from these services, people are going to miss critical testing, they’re not going to know their status and they’re going to be out in the community continuing to spread the disease.”
 Reduction in HIV funding

The first Trump administration, building on work started during the Obama administration, emphasized reducing new HIV infections, launching the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative (EHE) in 2019. The initiative’s stated goal was a 75% reduction in new infections in five years, and a 90% reduction in 10 years.
In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 37,981 HIV diagnoses in the United States. In 2023, the number reached 39,201. Men, Black people and people living in the South were most affected.
Congress allocated $267 million to multiple federal agencies for the EHE initiative in the 2019 fiscal year. That went up to $573.3 million in 2024. With the additional funds, total HIV prevention spending allocated just to the CDC climbed from $788.7 million in the 2019 fiscal year to $1 billion last year.
Designated “priority jurisdictions,” including Missouri, which had a substantial number of cases, received the bulk of the added federal funding.
The current Trump administration has not committed to continuing the effort. It has already delayed or terminated existing grants, closed government offices focused on HIV and moved to end research. And it appears poised to reduce future spending on key HIV programs.
The Kansas City Health Department has used federal grant funding it has received for outreach education and testing in nonclinical settings, like at bars or festivals. The health department administered 70 HIV tests at a recent Juneteenth celebration, for example.

And on June 27 — National HIV Testing Day — the health department will provide free testing at the Walgreens at 3845 Broadway Blvd. Other Walgreens locations will also offer testing that day.
Some people don’t feel comfortable going to a traditional health care setting for testing, or they don’t have access, Ryan said. That’s why taking the health department’s mobile clinic into the community to meet people where they already are is important.
At its recent “Health on the Block” event at Central High School, the health department administered 32 tests for HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia, all sexually transmitted infections. The result was four positive results.
“That’s a huge return on investment,” Ryan said.
 Grant already delayed, causing uncertainty

Federal funds also help pay for some of the 750,000 condoms the health department distributes annually; for other harm reduction materials; and for support services to help HIV patients find out where to obtain Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that people can take to prevent an HIV infection.
“PrEP navigators,” the health department staff who connect people to PrEP, also help patients understand whether they have health insurance to cover the cost of the treatment and other options for paying for it if they don’t.
Currently, the health department refers patients to other health clinics for PrEP prescriptions. But the department hopes to provide the service directly to patients by the end of the year. The city is funding that effort through general funds, Ryan said.
Other important work that the health department does that relies at least partially on federal funds involves HIV surveillance — encouraging HIV-positive patients to get treatment and stay in treatment. And surveillance work involves notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus.
Last year, Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services received $5.66 million through a CDC grant program known as the High-Impact HIV Prevention and Surveillance Programs for Health Departments. That was just one of the federal grants the state relies on.
Second-year funding of the grant, which was expected in June, had not come through midway through the month. So on June 17 the state agency told health departments, including Kansas City’s, and health clinics, including KC Care Clinic, to pause work. Funds from the grant they had been counting on would not be available, the state said, so reimbursements from the state would not be possible. That changed June 26, Ryan said, when the state notified the health department that funding had finally come through.
Without federal support, Ryan said, the work his division of the health department has been doing to try to slow the increase in new HIV cases would be impaired.
“We as the city and the health department will have to determine what services we want to continue” if funding is reduced, he said.

In the end, both Republicans and Democrats helped doom a  10-year moratorium on state artificial intelligence laws that had previously cleared the House. 



The U.S. Senate voted not to interfere with state artificial intelligence regulations, defeating a 10-year moratorium on such laws that had earlier cleared the House and alarmed California officials.
The 99-1 vote to strip the moratorium from the president’s “big, beautiful” budget bill followed opposition from a handful of Republicans. Dissenting from GOP colleagues, they argued the measure would allow the proliferation of highly realistic, AI-enabled “deepfake” impersonation videos, endanger jobs, and infringe on the rights of state governments.
The small rebellion was enough to seal the moratorium’s fate, given Republicans’ slim majority in the Senate and united opposition from Democrats
“Federalism is preserved and humans are safe for now,” one of the Republican dissenters, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, wrote following the vote.
In California, the moratorium would have threatened 20 AI laws on the books and 30 more proposals that are before the Legislature. State officials, including Attorney General Rob Bonta and the executive director of the California Privacy Protection Agency, came out against the measure.
Key to the moratorium’s defeat was pressure from a wide range of advocacy groups, said Ben Winters of the Consumer Federation of America. Organizations ranging from the Teamsters to the NAACP to the National Association of Evangelicals opposed the measure.
“The tech lobby attempted to manipulate the legislative process, but they were soundly defeated,” Winters wrote. “This outcome sends a clear signal that special interest groups cannot simply override public concerns with backroom deals, and that everyday people can successfully challenge corporate overreach.”
Prior to its defeat, the moratorium had already been watered down in the Senate, reduced in duration to five years and in scope to states that wanted access to $500 million in new federal funding for AI infrastructure and broadband deployment.
The battle over the measure underlined the bipartisan nature of concern around AI.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)After raising concerns about the financial impact of net energy billing, the Office of Public Advocate is praising the governor for signing a bill that could save money for Maine electricity customers.
Gov. Janet Mills signed LD 1777 into law Friday to reform the state’s net energy billing program, after it received bipartisan support in the Maine Senate and House of Representatives. While the cost of net energy billing is expected to exceed $234 million this year alone, the new law is projected to save Maine electricity customers more than $1.2 billion over the next 16 years, according to a news release from the Public Advocate’s office Tuesday.
“This new law will deliver real relief to Maine ratepayers while maintaining our state’s commitment to clean energy,” said Public Advocate Heather Sanborn.
Front-of-the meter projects, typically involving larger-scale projects such as community solar, are no longer eligible for net energy billing under the new law. Instead, the legislation directs the Governor’s Energy Office to develop an alternative program for these projects, and those in the state’s current tariff rate program, which is used by nonresidential customers. 
The Public Utilities Commission would need to approve the plan, but only if the benefits to ratepayers outweigh the costs. 
The new law also includes consumer protections to safeguard against solar oversubscription and ends the link between solar compensation and future utility rate increases, which the release said is a major driver of inflated costs. 
Net energy billing is a policy program designed to encourage customers to install or participate in small-scale renewable energy projects like solar panels by offering credits to offset their electricity bills. It was expanded in 2019 so customers can use renewable energy generators located outside of their property but within the same utility service territory, such as a community solar project. 
However, now “Maine’s community solar program needs reform precisely because it has been so successful,” Sanborn explained. The state set out to build 750 megawatts of solar, but went beyond that with more than 1,600 megawatts. 
Given that, “we need to make sure that solar power is delivered affordably to Mainers going forward,” Sanborn said.

Phil Murphy signed on June 30, 2025. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Legislation signed by Gov. Phil Murphy Monday evening ended the state’s decades-long practice of requiring publication of public notices in newspapers. 
The measure comes after the Star-Ledger, the state’s largest daily newspaper, announced it would cease printing in February, along with other smaller papers the company owns. That left several municipalities and counties without an official newspaper to publish notices of town meetings, planning board applications, foreclosures, and bid solicitations, as mandated under the state’s Open Public Meetings Act. 
Now, under the new law, public entities will be required to publish or advertise legal notices on their official website beginning March 1, 2026, with digital publication of such notices optional until that date. The law requires that the websites be free and accessible, with a direct hyperlink to legal notices placed “conspicuously” on the homepage. The secretary of state also would help set up a website to include notices from public entities statewide. 
Public agencies will be required to display notices on the website for at least one week and store them in an online archive for at least one year afterward. Local governments will not be required to maintain an archive until July 1, 2026, according to the measure.
Local governments could still publish legal notices in online news sites. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, public entities will have to publish an advertisement twice a month in online news outlets, and the ads must include links to their legal notices webpage. 
The measure goes into effect immediately. It caps off several stopgap measures the  Legislature advanced as lawmakers attempted to address the waning newspaper presence in the Garden State. Lawmakers first began exploring changes to the law back in November and tried to act quickly — towns have to designate their official newspaper by January and could face fines for failure to provide notice.
The changes have plenty of critics.
Assemblyman Brian Rumpf (R-Somerset) said the new law is a disservice to people who rely on physical publications to get their community news. Legislators should have compromised by including weekly and monthly papers, many of which are free at town grocery stores or libraries, he added.
“There are other methods by which this could be … without cutting all print notices out in one fell swoop,” said Rumpf, one of two Assembly members to vote against the bill.
Brett Ainsworth, president of the New Jersey Press Association, slammed the bill last week, saying it “diminishes transparency and erodes trust in government.”
Assemblyman Michael Inganamort (R-Sussex), a supporter, said the new law is a modern solution to a changing media environment. It allows residents to avoid paying for subscriptions to news outlets and securing physical newspapers, and instead access online information “from the comfort of their own home or their local library,” he said.
It also will save money for towns that were doling out public funds to pay for these notices, he added.
“We’re not in the ’70s anymore, and New Jerseyans, and frankly all Americans, are getting their information on primarily digital platforms,” he said.
The legislation was introduced last week by Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), the Senate president. It advanced out of the upper chamber unanimously. In the Assembly, the legislation was voted out 69-2 with two abstentions.

After 11th-hour negotiations to secure support from holdouts, Senate Republicans narrowly passed sweeping legislation that would affect everything from taxes to energy to immigration and pare back some social services to pay for it. 
The Senate vote was split 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie and casting the deciding vote. All Democrats voted against the bill and were joined by three Republicans. Senate leadership urged the House to support the amended bill this week.
“It’s been a long road to get to today,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said after passage, noting that GOP members and staff worked on the foundation for the bill even before their victories in the November elections. “Since we took office in January, Republicans have been laser-focused on achieving the bill before us today. And now we’re here, passing legislation that will permanently extend tax relief for hard-working Americans.”
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Monday he didn’t know if Republicans had the votes to pass their bill. And early Tuesday, Senate GOP leadership wasn’t sure if they had consolidated the support needed. But that ended up coming together later in the morning. Republicans could only afford to lose a few votes and are trying to wrap up the entire process by Friday so Trump can sign it into law.
But Murphy noted even some Republicans are raising concerns about the effects of the bill,  as evidenced by GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina saying he’ll vote no and deciding to retire amid Trump’s threat to back a primary challenger against him. Tillis pointed to the deep cuts to Medicaid that could hit his home state.
“It’s a deeply unpopular bill. The Republican Senate offices are being lit up with phone calls and emails pleading that they don’t vote for this,” Murphy told reporters Monday. “So you’re seeing senators make some pretty stunning announcements as they figure out how terrible this bill will be for their state.”
As the Senate made its way through a procedural vote and debate over the weekend, the bill entered the final stretch on Monday. Senators spent nearly 24 hours voting on amendments and motions during a marathon session referred to as a “vote-a-rama.” It went late into the night and finished early Tuesday as Senate leadership worked on wrangling more votes in behind-the-scenes negotiations.
Both of Connecticut’s senators introduced amendments, but they were rejected. Murphy offered one that took out reductions to taxes on health care providers, which allow states to help fund Medicaid through federal funding, and replace it with a corporate tax increase. Blumenthal’s sought to block national security funds to be used on a Qatari jet given to Trump to use as Air Force One.
One GOP amendment scrapped a notable part of the bill that would have placed a moratorium on states imposing regulations of artificial intelligence and could have had implications on Connecticut bills regarding AI.
The Senate bill initially reduced the ban on state AI regulations from 10 years to five years. But after the compromise fell apart, senators almost unanimously voted to take it out of the bill completely.
Murphy and Blumenthal took issue with the ban, saying it would have impeded on state legislation, like a bill from state Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford. During the Connecticut General Assembly session, Senate Bill 2 passed the Senate in May, but faced a possible veto from Gov. Ned Lamont who worried it could discourage innovation.
Maroney called the now-defunct federal provision “a significant overreach into states’ rights.” His bill would have placed greater transparency on the use of AI and curbed the dissemination of deep-fake porn. Blumenthal has also been working on the issue at the federal level.
When that vote series concluded overnight, the Senate moved to final passage early Tuesday. The House will now need to take it up again later this week to approve the amended version or make its own changes. Republicans are trying to stick to their self-imposed deadline to get it to Trump by July 4.
“We are in effect mortgaging our country so that our children are going to have to pay more for tax breaks now going to the wealthy and right now the pain caused by this measure and the hurt and harm to everyday people in Connecticut is simply gargantuan,” Blumenthal said Monday.
The bill is likely to have a significant impact on states and their own budgets as the federal government seeks to shift more costs over to them. If enacted, Connecticut could be on the hook for the first time ever in helping to cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.
That has Connecticut preparing for what’s to come, with the possibility of wide-ranging cuts to federal funding as well as new cost-sharing plans in the tax bill.
“People won’t see it for days or weeks, but eventually it will hit all of us, and it will hit our economy, because Connecticut will have to compensate for some of the loss of those hundreds of dollars that will no longer be coming from the federal government,” Blumenthal said.
While passage through a full Congress is still not assured, Republicans are in the driver’s seat since they are using a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation. This allows them to bypass filibusters in the Senate and pass certain kinds of bills without relying on votes from Democrats.
As the vehicle for much of Trump’s second-term agenda, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” seeks to extend the tax breaks in the 2017 tax law that passed during Trump’s first term and will expire at the end of the year. It would also steer billions of dollars in immigration funding, including money for a border wall and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And it would phase out clean energy tax credits passed during the Biden administration related to electric vehicles and consumer tax credits.
Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, are opposed and didn’t have a role in crafting the bill. They argue it will disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans and big corporations, balloon the national debt and cut critical services.
The legislation looks different in various ways than the House version of the “big beautiful bill.” 
The legislation would make many of the tax breaks permanent from 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including lower income tax rates. A number of tax provisions were amended or narrowed in the Senate bill.
The House bill raised the $10,000 threshold on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000, which would get phased out for those who make over $500,000. Both caps would increase by 1% through 2033. But the Senate version only raises the cap through 2029 and would have it return to the current threshold after that.
If the cap increases, it will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of the state’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
Workers would be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, but unlike the House bill, the Senate imposed caps on those deductions. And people could deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans as long as the vehicle was assembled in the U.S., but the Senate added into its bill that the car must be new. All three tax breaks would last through 2028.
Families would get to claim a slightly higher child tax credit. The House bill would have increased the rebate to $2,500 through 2028 and then go back down to $2,000 and indexed for inflation. It also required parents who filed taxes jointly to have Social Security numbers. The Senate changed it so that the tax credit is permanently at $2,200 starting in 2026, and only one parent needs to have a Social Security number.
Under the House bill, seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $4,000 deduction. The Senate bill increases it to $6,000.
To pay for these tax provisions, the bill includes steep spending cuts, which would have a direct impact on some safety net programs and state finances.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient would need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. Exemptions are made for certain groups including those who are pregnant or postpartum, Medicare recipients, veterans, caregivers and people with disabilities. States would be required to check on eligibility more often.
The Senate’s bill instead imposes work requirements on adults with children who are 14 years and older. It also adds a provision that blocks Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. Federal law already prohibits funding going toward abortions with a few exceptions, but it could threaten other services those clinics provide like cancer screenings, birth control and other types of routine care.
The Senate bill would also lower the cap on provider taxes, which is a mechanism that enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000. That estimate is based off of the House version of the bill.
Others in the state could also face major changes to their health insurance due to revisions to enrollment in the Affordable Care Act marketplace as well as new paperwork requirements that could delay tax credits to help pay for premiums for some enrollees.
On SNAP benefits, more older Americans would need to work or train at least 80 hours a month. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. But the Senate version has less stringent work requirements than the House bill. It would instead apply to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older.
States like Connecticut would need to pay a portion of SNAP benefits for the first time in the program’s history. That has raised concerns about potential benefit cuts if states cannot fill in the gap. But the Senate version is also less strict on cost sharing with states, though they would still pay a portion of the benefits based on error rate payments.
House leadership will be doing another temperature check on whether their members can support what the Senate did — or if skeptical members will push for additional changes. The House will take up the legislation Wednesday at the earliest.
“We’re going to fight this bill until the end,” Murphy said, noting ongoing concerns from Republicans in the House over changes made by the Senate.
“They still have a long way to go. We were able to kill their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act back in 2017,” he added. “Both Dick [Blumenthal] and I were part of that effort, and we’re not going to rest until this bill is on the president’s desk.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25176010765513-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 13:11:00.411207

Mike DeWine included the veto of a measure that would force public libraries to move materials deemed “inappropriate” out of sight of minors.
The provision, which was inserted by the Ohio House in its budget draft, would require a public library to hide “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression in a portion of the library that is not primarily open to the view of minors.”
The veto was delivered in the middle of the night, after DeWine signed the state operating budget late Monday, just before the deadline of midnight. In the message accompanying the vetoes, DeWine said the line-item “would place vague restrictions on public libraries in an effort to regulate placement of certain material within a public general circulation library.”
“In Ohio, we have strong laws on obscenity and material harmful to juveniles, and the DeWine-Tressel Administration expects those laws to be enforced,” the veto message stated.
At a press conference on Tuesday, DeWine said he thought the language was “not workable.”
“I think as parents or grandparents, no one wants their child to have a book or something that is inappropriate, something that is obscene, but I just felt that the language just does not work,” DeWine said.
The General Assembly still has the chance to override the veto with a three-fifths vote, but it would do so after libraries and advocates across the state stood staunchly against the measure.
The Columbus Metropolitan Library posted a statement to their social media applauding DeWine’s veto, calling it “a significant win for intellectual freedom and the right of every Ohioan to freely access information at their library.”

The Ohio Library Council also praised the decision, noting the laws on obscenity and harmful materials DeWine mentioned in his veto, along with protocols already in place in Ohio’s libraries.
“Ohio’s public libraries already have policies in place to protect children,” said Michelle Francis, executive director of the council. “No one cares more about the safety, education and well-being of children than libraries. For generations, libraries have provided trusted, welcoming spaces, and we will continue to do so with professionalism and integrity.”
While LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality Ohio was disappointed by other provisions it considers to be anti-LGBTQ+, the organization gave DeWine credit for the veto.
“While we remain deeply concerned about the presence of harmful ideology in our state’s budget, we appreciate that Governor DeWine used his line-item veto to block three of the six anti-LGBTQ+ amendments in the budget,” Equality Ohio said in a Tuesday morning statement.
Along with the public library provision, the organization also praised DeWine’s vetoes of a measure blocking funding to youth homeless shelters “that promote or affirm social gender transition,” and a provision that would limit the types of flags allowed to be displayed at state agencies, including, Equality Ohio said, the pride flag.
“Social issues don’t belong in public dollars,” said Dwayne Steward, executive director of Equality Ohio. “Stadiums shouldn’t be funded while our infrastructure and schools remain in disrepair. And taxpayer dollars should never be weaponized to erase, censor or shame our communities.
The pride flag was not mentioned in DeWine’s veto message, but he said the governor “should have the authority to approve additional flags not included in this section to ensure state-owned properties can properly pay respect to the armed forces and other worthy public causes as deemed necessary by the governor.”
In DeWine’s veto of the youth homeless shelter provision, he said “if a shelter has to call a homeless youth a pronoun that is incongruent with that youth’s gender to get that person into a shelter so the child won’t freeze to death, it needs to be done without fear of getting funding clawed back.”

(Courtesy of South Dakota State University)Hundreds of samples tested in recent years to determine if “forever chemicals” are tainting South Dakota water had to be shipped overnight to out-of-state labs for analysis.
That’s about to change.
Demand for laboratories to test samples for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is growing nationwide, as concerns about the chemicals in drinking water grow. PFAS have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s, including in modern products such as nonstick cookware and water-resistant clothing, and don’t break down easily in the environment or in the human body. Research indicates PFAS exposure may be linked to negative developmental and reproductive effects, and an increased risk of some cancers.
South Dakota State University in Brookings plans to become an Environmental Protection Agency-certified laboratory to test environmental samples. The state Department of Health plans to start its own testing program and become certified in drinking water testing.

The Brookings-based East Dakota Water Development District pledged to contribute $53,134 to get the plan started. The district partnered last year with South Dakota Mines, hundreds of miles away in Rapid City, to test for PFAS along the Big Sioux River watershed in the eastern part of the state. 
“Driving 15 blocks across town is a lot cheaper and quicker of a delivery system,” said Jay Gilbertson, manager at the district.
Chris Schmidt, director of the Water and Environmental Engineering Research Center at SDSU, said the university already has the instrument needed to test for PFAS compounds: a liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The machine is used by the chemistry department to test pharmaceuticals and identify other compounds in materials. South Dakota State tested for PFAS compounds previously in Teflon coating on pots and pans, Schmidt said.
The lab will start testing surface water from interested water districts and then use the same method to test bio solids, plant material and animal tissue, Schmidt said.
“Right now, the science is focused on detecting PFAS in the water and how it got there,” Schmidt said. “But we have to expand that to understand how it functions in the environment, how it moves through groundwater and through the food chain.”
SD tests for ‘forever chemicals’ in rivers to identify, address potential contamination

Testing could expand to brain tissue for possible connections to diseases, SDSU assistant professor and coordinator of the Campus Core Mass Spectrometry Facility M. Nurul Islam told the district board members at their June meeting. 
Testing drinking water, Schmidt said, involves different certification. Schmidt said he isn’t currently pursuing that certification, since the state is planning to fill that need.
The Health Department is partnering with the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources to develop a testing laboratory, according to a department spokesperson. The laboratory will start receiving testing samples this year.

A for-profit company takes over Tuesday.,"Public Consulting Group's Indiana subsidiary will operate on a five-region model, doing away with county prosecutors' 17 physical hubs. (Screenshot of Family and Social Services Administration document)For 40 years, a smattering of county prosecutorial offices have held the contract for the protection of endangered Hoosier adults. A for-profit company — Public Consulting Group’s Indiana subsidiary — took over Tuesday.
“The State of Indiana has committed to ensuring uninterrupted access to (Adult Protective Services) during the transition,” a Family and Social Services Administration document reads.
“Steps are being taken to minimize disruptions to active investigations and to preserve continuity of care,” the agency added. “Efforts are underway to retain experienced investigators and recruit qualified personnel, as well as to sustain collaboration with law enforcement, healthcare providers, and community-based services.”
That response was among a dozen answers to “frequently asked questions” about the switch.
PCG-Indiana will replace the 17 county-based hubs with five regions — Northwest, Northeast, Central, Southwest, and Southeast — and coordinated under a statewide model, according to a separate document with “key information” for “stakeholders.”
“This structure enhances local responsiveness while maintaining consistent practices and centralized oversight across the state,” it continued.
The reorganization is similar to what is happening at the Indiana Department of Child Services.
APS investigators will use “standardized” tools, like a statewide risk tool to screen reports. Cases representing “immediate risk of serious harm” will get a response within 24 hours, while a “serious risk” will merit a response within four days. All others will have a 20-day timeline, according to the FAQ document.
The documents emphasize that Indiana “remains a mandatory reporting state.”
Indiana Code defines an endangered adult as one who can’t care for themselves or their belongings and that is neglected, abused or exploited. Qualifying conditions include dementia, intellectual disability, mental illness or similar impairments; lawmakers removed alcohol and drug misuse from the definition this year.
FSSA’s APS webpage doesn’t reflect the program or definition changes.

(Photo: Greg Childress)WASHINGTON, D.C. — Anna Oliva, the executive director of the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH), has never seen advocates for people experiencing homelessness as concerned about the future as they’ve been the last six months.
The 30-year veteran in the fight to end homelessness told NC Newsline that advocates and others are worried about the current political landscape that has left federal funding for programs for the unhoused fraught with uncertainty.
“Primarily, I would say folks are scared,” Oliva said Monday. “They’re scared — when I say folks, I mean service providers, our leadership, our homeless services leadership, people who are in the system — they don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Oliva made her comments during an interview with NC Newsline shortly after the NAEH kicked off its annual convention in Washington. More than 2,000 advocates, service providers, nonprofit leaders and people with lived experienced have gathered in the nation’s capital to discuss policies and strategies to end homelessness.
“All of this uncertainty is making what are really hard jobs even harder,” Oliva said. “And it’s making the lives of people who are tenants in these programs uncertain in a way that I think is pretty damaging.”

Hard times for get harder
The uncertainty couldn’t have come at a worse time. Homelessness in America increased by 18% in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR). The report found 770,000 Americans — an 18% increase over the previous year — experiencing homelessness on a January night in 2024. It was the largest number recorded since HUD began conducting the counts in 2005.
According to HUD, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased in every category — except for veterans — measured during the department’s annual Point-in-Time (PIT) Count. The count is a snapshot of the number of individuals in shelters, temporary housing and unsheltered on a single night.
“I would say that right now folks are, they’re nervous about the direction that the country is going and how they might try and figure out how to make up a [funding] gap, right?” Oliva said. “If there is a gap, if there is a cut that’s made from the federal government, if the federal government no longer funds the Continuum of Care (CoC) program, what does that mean for them?”
The CoC to which Oliva referred is a community-based planning process and system aimed at ending homeless by coordinating efforts among various stakeholders to provide housing and services to families and individuals experiencing homelessness. The system is largely funded by HUD.
The NAEH has lobbied against budget cut it believes would negatively impact programs to prevent and end homelessness. It has urged Congress to reject cuts to Homeless Assistance Grants and other safety net resources. The Alliance estimates that cuts to the program would eliminate funding for more than 166,000 units of Permanent Supportive Housing, which is a critical intervention for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness.
President Trump’s FY 2026 budget proposal calls for $532 million in cuts to the federal government’s Homeless Assistance Grants account, the NAEH said in a recent statement.

Mega-bill debate looms, spreads fear
The conference in Washington is taking place against the backdrop of a Senate debate over President Donald Trump’s so-called “one big, beautiful bill.” The bill stirred controversy in North Carolina over the weekend when U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) voted against it, arguing that it would cause more than 660,000 North Carolinians to lose health care.
Trump threatened to run a candidate against Tillis in next year’s GOP primary and Tillis abruptly announced that he would not seek reelection.
“What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding’s not there anymore, guys?” Tillis said in a floor speech.

Nationally, estimates from the Congressional Budget Office show that the legislation being debated in the Senate would leave nearly 12 million people without health care coverage by 2034. The bill slashes $1.1 trillion from Medicaid, Medicare and Obamacare over that period. More than $1 trillion of those cuts coming from Medicaid.
Oliva said if the budget legislation passes, the advocates and service providers for people experiencing homelessness will have a new set of problems with which to contend.
“We’re very concerned about how many people are one medical bill away from losing their housing, how many people need those services in order to maintain their housing over time, how many people will be priced out of the rental market if they have to pay medical bills above their rent,” Oliva said “There’s all sorts of questions that we have about what the impact of that would be in communities.”
Oliva said the impact of Medicaid cuts would be widespread.
“All of these social services and policies are connected, and could have a pretty significant impact on the number of people experiencing homelessness in communities nationwide, red communities and blue communities alike, rural communities, suburban communities,” Oliva said. “Rural and suburban communities rely much more heavily on federal dollars than urban communities do, and they’re going to be deeply impacted by these potential changes should they pass.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1024x768.png,,,2025-07-01 12:19:33.126941

The Supreme Court has ruled on a previous case in favor of upholding the California law, which opponents argue puts an unfair burden on pork producers by impacting their ability to sell to the state.
The IPPA lawsuit argued Proposition 12, which voters approved in 2018, imposed excessive burdens on interstate commerce and discriminated against out-of-state farmers.
The case was heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled in June 2024, in favor of California. IPPA filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the decision, which is the petition the court denied Monday.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led more than 20 attorneys general from other ag-producing states on an amici curiae in support of the IPPA appeal to the Supreme Court.
Bird said in a statement Monday she was disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision.
“Laws like this hurt Iowa’s rural communities and make it more difficult for Americans to enjoy the world-class pork products they have come to love and expect out of our state,” Bird said.
Bird said she would continue to fight against similar laws, including a Massachusetts law against which the attorney general also led an amici curiae with other states, urging for an appeal.
“States like California and Massachusetts should not dictate Iowa farming practices,” Bird said.
The California law, which went into effect in 2024, stipulates that regardless of where an animal was raised, it must comply with the state regulation on animal confinement in order to be sold in California. The law stipulates sow enclosures must have at least 24 square feet of room. The law, which passed as a state referendum, was supported by animal rights organizations that say this spacing would give the animals enough space to turn around freely.
The west-coast state is a major pork consumer, meaning its laws have a big impact on pork production across the country and in states like Iowa, which produces the most pork in the nation.
Pork producers said the law would disrupt the pork supply chain and raise costs at the consumer level, as producers retrofit their facilities to comply with the law.
Eldon McAfee, counsel for IPPA, said the organization was “disappointed, obviously” by the decision and that many pork producers “don’t understand” how a California law “can be enforced here in Iowa.”
McAfee said producers believe this should be a marketplace decision driven by consumer and producer choice, not an enforcement.
“We do not believe it can be mandated by law, we believe it is unconstitutional,” McAfee said. “But the court disagreed in the NPPC case and declined to accept this case.”
McAfee referenced a Supreme Court decision against the National Pork Producers Council’s petition of the California law.
He said while the court did not issue an explanation of the decision, the docket entries show justices discussed the case seven times before eventually declining the petition, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh dissenting.
McAfee said the next step forward is legislative action.
“The courts have stated the basic premise that it is the federal government, Congress, that regulates interstate commerce,” McAfee said. “We believe the best option is federal legislation … to prevent this type of law.”
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, a Republican from Iowa, has also been a vocal opponent of Proposition 12, working with other Republicans in Iowa and other states to advance legislation the past several years that would supersede the state law.
“This mandate on Iowa hog farmers increases pork prices for families, makes hog farming needlessly more expensive, harms our rural communities, and threatens our food security,” Feenstra said in a statement Monday. “I remain committed to getting a new, five-year Farm Bill signed into law that repeals Prop 12 and delivers certainty and clarity for our hog farmers.”

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations (Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix).As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.
Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

Attorneys for Teresa Youngblut have asked a judge to extend a deadline to present evidence to prosecutors as they weigh whether to bring capital crimes in the case.

Attorneys for Teresa Youngblut want more time to present information as they try to convince federal prosecutors not to file charges that carry the death penalty against their client in connection with the fatal shooting of a U.S. border patrol agent earlier this year in Vermont.
“This Court should step in to ensure Ms. Youngblut receives a meaningful opportunity to persuade the government not to pursue the death penalty,” Steven Barth and Julie Stelzig, lawyers for Youngblut, wrote in a Monday night filing in federal court in Burlington. 
The attorneys wrote in the 21-page filing that the current deadline, later this month, to submit mitigating evidence against seeking the death penalty eligible charges in the case should be extended to “at least” Jan. 30, 2026.
The lawyers also asked for a hearing on the request. Judge Christina Reiss, who is presiding in the case, has not yet issued a ruling.
Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, is currently facing firearms and assault charges in connection with the Jan. 20 shootout on Interstate 91 in Coventry that killed David Maland, a U.S. border patrol agent who conducted a traffic stop that afternoon on a vehicle Youngblut had been driving. 
At some point during that traffic stop, according to charging documents, Youngblut got out of the vehicle and began shooting. An exchange of gunfire occurred with law enforcement on the scene. Maland was killed in the shootout as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national who was a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving. 
Youngblut has not been charged directly with firing the shot that killed Maland. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into his fatal shooting, has refused to confirm who fired that fatal shot. 
Youngblut, who was also hurt in the shootout, has been held in custody since receiving treatment for injuries in a hospital.
Barth, one of Youngblut’s attorneys, said at a hearing in the case last week that he expected federal prosecutors to file charges against his client in “short order” that carry the possibility of the death penalty. 
He declined further comment to reporters following the hearing. 
However, in the filing Monday night, Youngblut’s legal team provided more information about what has been taking place outside of the public eye in the case.
On June 2, federal prosecutors informed Youngblut’s defense team that “they should be prepared to meet with the U.S Attorney General’s Capital Case Review Committee” on July 28, the lawyers wrote in the filing.
That committee screens cases for the U.S. Attorney General’s Office and determines whether to seek charges that carry the death penalty. 
Attorneys referenced an internal guidebook for the department, which says a meeting with the committee is intended to let the defense present evidence that the government would consider when deciding whether to seek the death penalty against someone charged with “potentially capital crimes.”
The lawyers wrote that the July 28 deadline does not provide Youngblut’s defense team with enough time.
Attorney said the “unprecedentedly tight timeline is even more untenable” because Youngblut’s defense team only recently secured an attorney who specializes in cases that could involve the death penalty.
“And,” the lawyers added, “irregularities aside, the government’s schedule promises to turn Ms. Youngblut’s submission into a near-pointless formality.”
Youngblut and Bauckholt allegedly had ties to a loosely linked group of people known as the “Zizians.” Members of the group, an offshoot of the so-called Rationalist movement in the San Francisco Bay Area, have been tied to several other homicides across the country, including in California and Pennsylvania.
Neither Barth nor the U.S Attorney’s Office for Vermont, which is prosecuting Youngblut’s case, could be reached Tuesday for comment.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Black Hills Energy customers may see their bills increase by nearly 9%, or about $5.96 per month for average residential use, if regulators approve a settlement agreement presented Monday.
That’s a better scenario than first proposed by Black Hills Energy, which supplies natural gas to 120,200 customers throughout Kansas, primarily in the southwest and south-central part of the state.
The Kansas Corporation Commission, which oversees Kansas utilities, questioned staff and parties involved in reaching a unanimous settlement agreement that dropped the initial Black Hill request from $12.8 million of new revenue to $10.8 million.
That would have raised customer bills by about $11 per month, or 17.6%, KCC filings showed.
The settlement agreement rolls the company’s current Gas System Reliability Surcharge of $4.4 million, which is already being collected on customer bills, into the new rates, resulting in a total rate increase of $15.2 million.
Parties to the settlement agreement are KCC staff, Black Hills Energy, Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, WoodRiver Energy, Kansas Municipal Energy Agency, Symmetry Energy, Freedom Pipeline and Seaboard Energy Kansas.
The GSRS is a rider that shows up separately on customer bills and includes costs for improving the gas distribution system, integrity management programs and cybersecurity projects to maintain safe and reliable service, according to Black Hills breakdown of the average bill.
Robert Daniel, Black Hills director of regulatory affairs for Kansas and Arkansas, testified the company had one new revenue increase in the past decade. He said a 2014 rate case resulted in about $800,000 in new revenue and a 2021 rate case brought no new revenue.
“What that tells me is that we, as a Black Hills Kansas entity, have run our business very well in terms of controlling costs over a decade,” he said.
KCC commissioner Andrew French pushed Daniel on whether there were other costs besides acceleration of costs included in the new requested rates, such as capital investment. 
“It really is just the baked-in costs have gone up,” Daniel said. “The company has not accelerated our Kansas capital investments and has done our absolute best to manage expenses throughout this time.”
The cost of maintenance and operational expenses were relatively flat from the 2014 to the 2021 rate case, he said.
“That was not the case for the last three or four years, really given the price of everything has gone up,” Daniel said. “I know customers feel that in many different ways, and so do we. It’s really just a general, overall increase in the cost of doing business.”
Daniel also said customer usage has gone down because of warmer weather.
“The simple fact is that the last 10 years have been warmer for whatever reason,” he said. “Customers are using less gas on a use-per-customer basis.”
More than 200 people submitted comments on the requested rate increase, most in opposition. Many said investors should have to absorb more costs rather than ratepayers.
“The 17.6% rate request is outrageous,” said Kerry Altenbernd, of Lawrence, in a written comment. “This is over seven times the current inflation rate. Black Hills needs to be more efficient in its use of ratepayers money, and make its investors shoulder the brunt of upgrades to their system, all of which expenses are tax deductible as business expenses. The KCC needs to protect Kansans from this kind of corporate excess.”
Black Hills asked for a return on equity for investors of 10.5%. The proposed settlement agreement is an ROE in the range of 9.45% to 10.05%, depending on factors such as cost of debt and capital structure. 
Customers also will see a refund of $2.95 million between November 2025 and April 2026 that is associated with the Tax Adjustment Rider. The rider shows up on customer bills as a credit or charge, based on the percentage of actual monthly base billings.
French said a commission order on the settlement agreement is due by Aug. 29, but he noted that Black Hills asked that an order be issued by Aug. 1, as the company would like the new rates to go into effect on that date.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Black-Hills-Robert-Daniel-20250630_103737-1-1024x586.jpg,,,2025-07-01 12:19:33.126941

Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, flipped the 7th District in 2024 into the Republican column after it had been held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin before she won election to the U.S. Senate that same year. Maasdam’s campaign website notes he is being advised by Emma Grundhauser, a former campaign aide to Slotkin. 
The central Michigan district, which includes  Lansing, is viewed by Democrats as one they must win back to try and reclaim a congressional majority in the 2026 midterms.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
 

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — some under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states, including Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm.
The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government’s use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews.
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads.
In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration’s position.
“In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America’s energy industry stifled by Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said.
While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing.

The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint.

To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects.
In Michigan, Tribal Nations and environmental activists have spoken out as the Corps moves forward with emergency processing procedures for Enbridge’s Line 5 tunnel project, which would replace dual oil and natural gas pipelines running through the lakebed where Lake Michigan and Huron meet, with a new segment housed inside a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock.
While the tunnel project came as part of any agreement with the state to minimize the risk of an oil spill, opponents of the project argue construction would harm nearby wetlands, while still carrying risk for an oil spill.
The project’s public comment window came to an end on Monday.
The states other than Michigan filing the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

(Courtesy photo)Nearly a dozen food banks serving portions of Indiana teamed up to launch an advertising campaign this week, urging Hoosiers to protect nutrition funding — including food benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — from congressional cuts.
Feeding Indiana’s Hungry targeted Indianapolis, Terre Haute and Evansville for digital advertising campaigns, as well as an outdoor advertisement in the 4th Congressional District, which includes parts of northwestern Indiana anchored by Lafayette.
The ads direct Hoosiers to contact their U.S. Senators and Representatives and ask them to vote against such “harmful” cuts.


Members of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry include:

Food Bank of Northwest Indiana, Merrillville
Food Bank of Northern Indiana, South Bend
Food Finders Food Bank, Inc., Lafayette
Community Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Indiana, Fort Wayne
Second Harvest Food Bank of East Central Indiana, Inc., Muncie
Terre Haute Catholic Charities Foodbank
Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Indianapolis
Hoosier Hills Food Bank, Bloomington
Tri-State Food Bank, Inc., Evansville
Dare to Care Food Bank, Louisville, KY
Freestore Foodbank, Cincinnati, OH



“Hoosiers will continue to struggle feeding their families with the drastic cuts Congress is currently considering,” said Emily Bryant, the executive director of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry. “The nonprofit sector is already scrambling to meet the need — the lines at food pantries are getting longer by the day. We call on Congress to act now to save lives.”
Nutritional funding and other social services programs are at risk for congressional cuts in Washington D.C. this week as Congress grapples with President Donald Trumps “big, beautiful bill.” Under the proposal, states with higher error rates will pick up a portion of the tab, potentially billions of dollars for some large states.
The national association for SNAP retailers — largely convenience and grocery stores — shared an estimated cost for Indiana following changes in the U.S. Senate, putting that number at $261 million — an improvement over the previous version of the bill.
Congressional cuts would shift funding to an already strapped state budget, under which agencies saw 5% cuts earlier this year. A $2 billion predicted revenue drop over the next two years played a roll in ending a supplemental summertime meal program for children enrolled on nutritional programs like SNAP.
The current bill in Congress is projected to add $3.25 trillion to deficits during the next decade, according to the latest calculation from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, largely due to tax cuts. Republicans trimmed that number by curbing federal commitments for programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
A Monday night vote to strip SNAP language from the bill was narrowly defeated on a 49-51 vote after two Republican senators, both from Alaska, voted with Democrats. Both of Indiana’s senators voted to keep the cuts for SNAP.

Lucas Roff met his then-girlfriend when he was going to college at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie. After he graduated with a degree in biology, they got engaged.
“I decided I need to find a job up here,” he said.
Several months ago, he landed at the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan as an environmental technician through the MI Healthy Climate Corps. His work includes helping tribes tackle grants to reduce pollution and data about greenhouse gas emissions.
For example, he said, “if we’re assisting a tribe on their solid waste here, we would set up a plan to help them make their trash pickup more efficient.”
The Climate Corps aimed to help Michigan reach its goal of economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. Until recently, it fell under the umbrella of AmeriCorps, a federal program that offers paid community service jobs. It came to a halt when the Trump administration cut nearly $400 million in grant funding to AmeriCorps in April.
AmeriCorps programs range from veteran support to education to disaster response. The MI Healthy Climate Corps focused on work such as local energy plans, agriculture, and community outreach.
Members received stop work orders at the end of April. In the interim, some organizations tried to find other ways to continue the work of their corps members.
Then, in early June, Michigan said it would pay out stipends to the members who wanted to complete their terms, which last through mid-October. It tapped into the state General Fund and repurposed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding, according to Jeff Johnston, a spokesperson for Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.
“The good news is that the work that this team had been doing around the state — in nearly 30 communities and organizations throughout the state — is continuing,” Johnston said.
Members received stipends between $30,000 and $35,000 during the program’s first eight-month term.
Johnston said the work includes energy audits, helping to increase “vehicle fleet electrification,” creating environmental education guides and community sustainability plans — “a variety of projects that various communities and organizations statewide wouldn’t otherwise have the resources to tackle, but which provide real, tangible benefits for their people.”
Mallory Meston, a climate readiness fellow with the Michigan Office of Rural Prosperity, said she works with township supervisors and clerks to figure out their plans for state funding for communities adopting renewable energy.
“I help them kind of brainstorm different projects or ideas that would most fit their community and that their community has interest in,” she said, such as townships renovating their parks, township halls or fire departments. She also works on climate and energy efforts through the Rural Readiness Network.
The stop work order brought all that to a halt.
“No one really knew what was going to happen, and it was kind of just a lot of question marks,” she said. “But I’m really glad to be back now. My teammates at ORP have been great and were able to kind of pick up my projects, and so I’m just finally getting back into everything.”
The nonprofit Community Economic Development Association of Michigan, or CEDAM, manages the Climate Corps program. It had started recruiting hosts for the third cohort of climate corps members in April. But due to the uncertainty of AmeriCorps funding, it says it has paused recruiting for now.
Michigan was among a coalition of states that sued over the AmeriCorps cuts at the end of April. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore funding to those states’ AmeriCorps programs while denying their request to reinstate AmeriCorps staff placed on administrative leave.
In an email to IPR, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that AmeriCorps had failed eight consecutive audits and identified more than $45 million in improper payments last year, and that states “can and should fund programs that benefit their local communities.”
AmeriCorps didn’t respond to a request for comment.
With the state’s funding push, Meston and almost all of the other corps members are staying on as fellows. (Since the program is no longer affiliated with AmeriCorps, the state changed its name to the MI Healthy Climate Fellows program.)
Roff, with the Inter-Tribal Council, was hoping to keep working in a different role if the program was cut. So the decision to continue as a climate fellow was easy.
“I really enjoy my job here, and I really enjoy the people that I work with,” he said. “To have this program started again, to have another opportunity to keep working here, I jumped at it.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-070712-1024x768.png,,,2025-07-01 11:18:34.004577

In court, Dr. Nancy Harper comes across as professional and authoritative. Often she begins her testimony by explaining her subspeciality: child abuse pediatrics, which focuses on the diagnosis and documentation of signs of child abuse. Her role, she often reminds judges and juries, is solely medical. Whether or not to remove a child from their home, terminate the parent’s rights or, in the most serious cases, charge a caregiver criminally is not up to her.
According to Harper’s testimony, she and her team at the Otto Bremer Trust Center for Safe and Healthy Children in Minneapolis handle about 700 cases of suspected abuse each year. She has testified that 10% to 20% of those wind up confirmed for physical abuse, although it is difficult to determine if these figures are accurate since child protection cases are not public.
When Harper, the center’s director, and her team diagnose abuse, parents and caregivers often struggle to challenge those opinions. By Harper’s own estimation, she’s never been wrong.
“I don’t think I’ve ever had a case where I thought it was abusive head trauma and the other specialist didn’t,” Harper testified in 2023, in the case of a day care provider charged with the death of a child in her care.
The defense attorney in the case pressed her: “Have you ever incorrectly diagnosed a child with abusive head trauma?”
“Not currently to my recollection,” she answered.
But in a handful of cases, judges and juries have found day care providers and parents not guilty of crimes after Harper has testified that abuse occurred, though a verdict cannot necessarily be interpreted as a repudiation of Harper or any other expert witness’ determinations or credibility.
Additionally, two federal lawsuits filed recently accuse Harper of ignoring or even concealing alternative explanations for children’s injuries. And, more broadly, medical and legal experts are increasingly questioning a leading child abuse diagnosis, shaken baby syndrome, which is also known as abusive head trauma.
Harper did not respond to requests for comment. She has yet to respond to either lawsuit. In past court testimony, Harper has said that both shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma are considered scientifically valid diagnoses by the mainstream medical community. Any controversy, she has said, exists primarily in the legal world rather than the medical one.
Kathleen Pakes, a former prosecutor who now specializes in the forensics of child abuse cases for the Office of the Wisconsin State Public Defender, said Harper’s claim of never making an incorrect diagnosis strains credulity.
“There is no other specialty in medicine that has zero error rate. None,” she said.
Below are four cases in which Harper concluded there was abuse but courts or juries determined otherwise.
On July 12, 2017, an 11-month-old boy named Gabriel Cooper collapsed in his high chair at the day care that Sylwia Pawlak-Reynolds operated in South Minneapolis. Paramedics took him to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was declared brain dead a day later.
Harper reviewed Cooper’s medical records and wrote that “in the absence of a well-documented consistent severe accidental injury, non-accidental trauma or abusive head trauma remains the primary diagnostic consideration.” The child, she wrote, was essentially shaken to death. Before any criminal charges were filed, Pawlak-Reynolds boarded a plane for her native Poland to care for her ailing father, according to her attorney. In February 2018, prosecutors charged Pawlak-Reynolds with two counts of second-degree murder, citing Harper’s diagnosis.
According to her husband, Will Reynolds, they did not realize Pawlak-Reynolds was pregnant when she boarded her flight to Poland. She remained there to give birth to their third child, who is now 6, while Reynolds remained in Minnesota with their two older children, who are now 13 and 16. Reynolds said he and his wife have no confidence that she will get a fair trial, and that she fears she will lose custody of their youngest child if she reenters the country. The family has now been separated for eight years.

Early in the case, Pawlak-Reynolds’ attorneys obtained the same copy of Cooper’s hospital records that had been provided to Minneapolis police, which included the paramedics’ report. The document had been printed out at a significantly reduced scale, shrinking the text to the point that some fields were illegible. Two years later, they obtained a second copy, printed at normal size, which revealed a possible alternate explanation for the injuries: “Mom recalls [patient] did fall 2 days ago, striking the back of his head.”
“That was the sort of proverbial silver-bullet evidence that we’re always looking for in every case and usually never find,” said Brock Hunter, Pawlak-Reynolds’ lawyer.
Polish courts, including an appeals court, have denied extradition requests from the U.S. three times, and the country’s minister of justice has affirmed the rulings. The denials are particularly critical of Harper’s assessment. Polish forensic experts evaluated the case records and took note of a finding by a neurology expert hired by Pawlak-Reynolds, who wrote that Cooper carried a gene tied to a blood clotting disorder.
The ambulance report, the Polish judges wrote, “was concealed from the defense.”
“Then, after the fact was made public, it did not affect the actions of the American authorities in any way,” a Polish district court judge wrote in 2022.
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office certified Cooper’s manner of death as “undetermined” and the date and place of injury “unknown,” a tacit disagreement with Harper’s opinion that Cooper would have collapsed “shortly after infliction of the trauma.”
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office declined to comment.
Then in 2023, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wrote to Pawlak-Reynolds’ attorneys after meeting with them: “We agree that to resolve the current impasse regarding Ms. Pawlak-Reynolds, the best course for all involved is to dismiss the pending charges without prejudice, and for her to return to the United States.”
But months later, Moriarty changed her mind.
In a statement to ProPublica, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office wrote that the office is completing a “final, thorough review” of the case that will include an evaluation of “concerns regarding the medical conclusions and the overall strength of the case.”
Gabriel’s parents, Joseph and Samantha Cooper, did not respond to requests for comment. In a television interview in June, they denied that Cooper struck the back of his head two days before his collapse. They said that they want justice for their son.
Pawlak-Reynolds declined to comment through her attorney. In late February, her husband filed a federal lawsuit against Harper that claims she “knowingly and intentionally falsified, modified and erased exculpatory information” from her evaluation of Cooper, and she diagnosed abusive head trauma to “promote her own personal, academic, reputational and financial needs.”
Harper has yet to respond to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Hennepin Healthcare, which operates Hennepin County Medical Center, declined to comment on the case or the lawsuit.
“There is no oversight,” Reynolds said. “It’s the thing they’re most resistant against and the thing that is most necessary to stop this legacy of brutality, that results in kids being taken away from innocent caregivers and innocent caregivers going to prison.”

In August 2017, Kathryn Campbell called 911 after a 4-month-old girl at her day care seemed lethargic and was “breathing wrong.” First responders did not take the baby to the hospital, but her mother eventually did. At the hospital, MRI scans showed fluid in the baby’s brain and doctors noted small bruises.
Dr. Barbara Knox, a child abuse pediatrician then with the University of Wisconsin, told police it was “obvious child abuse.” The Dane County district attorney charged Campbell with physical abuse of a child. Campbell pleaded not guilty.
But before the 2021 trial, Knox left the University of Wisconsin after she was placed on leave for “unprofessional acts that may constitute retaliation” and intimidation of her own staff. A Wisconsin Watch investigation cast doubt on Knox’s judgment in several cases of alleged abuse.
Knox did not respond to the Wisconsin Watch series or to ProPublica’s requests for comment. After two families in Alaska sued her in 2022, alleging she had wrongly concluded their children had been abused, Knox wrote in an affidavit that she has no control over whether police and child protection services workers take children away from parents, that she did not “conspire” with police or anyone else on custody issues, and that she did not personally evaluate one of the children. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2024 after the families agreed to drop the matter.
Knox moved on to a job at the University of Florida. According to a spokesperson for the university, Knox resigned as a pediatrician with the Child Protective Team in late June, effective Aug. 15. He declined to comment on the circumstances.
At Campbell’s trial, Knox’s name was never mentioned. Instead, Harper stepped in as an expert witness. When Campbell heard Knox had been replaced, she was initially hopeful.
“I’m like, oh, great, new eyes,” Campbell said. “They’re going to look at it and go, ‘This is nuts, I don’t agree with this.’ And I definitely was wrong.”
Harper’s assessment affirmed Knox’s diagnosis of abuse. She told the jury that the bruises were likely caused by squeezing by an adult’s hand. A medical expert hired by Campbell’s defense argued that the child’s bleeding could not be precisely dated and that a preexisting medical condition could have caused it.
After just two hours of deliberation, the jury returned a not guilty verdict. Campbell said she is grateful to have the case concluded, though she said she is still haunted by the accusations against her.
“That was the hardest thing too, going home after this case was done, and being like, ‘Am I allowed to be alone with my children now?’” she said. “It’s all because of the quote-unquote experts not doing their due diligence and looking further into underlying issues that these kids could have.”
In a statement to ProPublica, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne expressed confidence in both Harper and Knox, saying “their testimony had been consistent with many different medical professionals and experts in their own areas of practice.”
“It is important to note that a not guilty verdict by lay jurors hardly invalidates the widespread acceptance of abusive head trauma as a diagnosis in the medical community nor would it cause us to have concerns about Dr. Harper’s qualifications or knowledge in the field,” he added. “Jurors are not bound to accept any expert testimony as accurate.”
In the winter of 2022, a 4-month-old boy began breathing abnormally at his day care in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. His parents took him to a hospital, where he died days later. A police investigation determined that his day care provider, Joanna Ford, left him and several other children alone in her home for over an hour while she went to a tattoo and piercing parlor.
Prosecutors used Harper as an expert witness in the case. After evaluating the child’s medical records, she concluded that his injuries were “clinically diagnostic of abusive head trauma,” or, put another way, Ford shook the baby violently. She was charged with first-degree reckless homicide. Ford pleaded not guilty.
Ford’s defense lawyers successfully petitioned the judge in the case for a hearing to determine whether Harper’s expert witness testimony would be scientifically valid and admissible at trial. In response to questions, Harper explained why the child’s symptoms — brain swelling, blood under his skull, damage to his eyes — pointed to abuse, and why, despite the controversy surrounding it, the diagnosis of abusive head trauma was scientifically sound. She also explained that, because the baby was not walking or crawling, the fact that none of his caregivers could explain his injuries indicated abuse.
“People should know what happened,” she testified.
On cross examination by Ford’s lawyers, Harper said she couldn’t say for certain what time the abuse would have occurred, exactly how Ford had injured the baby and that there are no “great biomechanical models” for shaken baby syndrome.
A little over a month later, Judge Lisa McDougal delivered a highly critical ruling that barred Harper from telling the jury that the child died as the result of “abusive head trauma, non-accidental injury, child abuse or murder.” She also took issue with the idea that a lack of explanation for injuries is indicative of abuse, calling it a “leap in logic.”
“Offering a conclusive opinion as to how an injury may have occurred crosses a line and does not fit within the dictionary definition of what diagnosis is,” McDougal said. The judge also said that Harper views herself as an advocate, and that that casts doubt on her “fidelity to the scientific validation of abusive head trauma diagnoses, especially when it is a close call.”
The murder charge was dismissed. For leaving the children alone, Ford pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of neglect of a child where the consequence is death. She is serving a 10-year prison sentence. Ford, through her attorney, declined a request for an interview. The Iowa County district attorney also declined to comment.
On Feb. 4, 2022, Paul and Sarah Marshall hosted a dinner for her parents and a family friend at their home in Hudson, Wisconsin. Afterward, their 7-week-old son, Fox, became fussy. Paul Marshall carried him into the mother-in-law unit on the lower level of the house, which was cool and dark, to try to calm him. He emerged minutes later in a panic, yelling that the baby spit up and stopped breathing.
Paramedics rushed Fox to Children’s Minnesota, a hospital about 25 minutes across the state border in St. Paul. Doctors ran tests, and a scan showed Fox had a skull fracture with fluid pooling on both sides of his brain. He died days later.
Harper examined Fox, as well as his twin sister, Liana, and found “skull fractures, likely rib fractures, metaphyseal fractures.”
“This constellation of findings in a nonambulatory infant is clinically diagnostic of inflicted injury or child physical abuse likely occurring on more than one occasion,” she wrote.
But the Marshalls said that wasn’t true. They told Harper that Sarah Marshall had experienced a difficult pregnancy with gestational diabetes and severe anemia, and that Liana had a vacuum-assisted delivery. Both twins had been to their regular pediatrician over health concerns. While Liana’s health improved, Fox’s had not.
A spokesperson for Children’s Minnesota declined to comment on the case.
Because he was the last person alone with Fox before he stopped breathing, Paul Marshall was charged with first-degree reckless homicide. He was also charged with physical abuse of a child for hurting Liana. Sarah Marshall said there was no evidence that her soft-spoken husband had hurt their children.
“The state wanted to cast me as a naive idiot,” she said. “I chose not to believe it because of the logic and facts in my face. I had no reason to believe the accusation.”
At Paul Marshall’s 2023 trial, his defense lawyer, Aaron Nelson, cross-examined the other doctors who treated or evaluated Fox and Liana, and was able to highlight points of medical disagreement. A doctor who tested Liana for genetic disorders said she could not rule out rickets as a possible cause of her bone fractures. A neuropathologist did not agree with Harper that Fox had a trauma-induced blood clotting disorder. By Harper’s own admission on cross-examination, determining the age of the skull fractures in children Fox and Liana’s age was difficult. Nelson called six of his own medical experts to suggest that the difficult birth or a vitamin deficiency could explain the twins’ injuries.
“How many people have to be wrong for Dr. Harper to be right?” Nelson said in closing arguments.
After an 11-day trial, the jury found Marshall not guilty.
In a statement to ProPublica, St. Croix County District Attorney Karl Anderson pointed out that Harper was not the only treating physician who was concerned that Fox and Liana had been abused.
“A not guilty verdict does not mean that the jury concluded that the children were not abused,” Anderson said. “Rather, it means that they did not conclude that the State proved that Paul Marshall caused the death, beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Six weeks after the trial, the family moved three hours away into a century-old farmhouse that is far from the community that they felt wrongfully villainized by.
One of the cruelest impacts of the abuse diagnosis, they said, came after it was clear that Fox would die and the hospital staff began making preparations for his organs to be donated. Sarah Marshall said she had hoped to someday hear her son’s heart beating in another child’s chest. Instead, a court order put a halt to the procedure.
“They were already treating him as evidence,” she said.
The experience of going from a grieving parent to an accused murderer, her husband said, has given the couple post-traumatic stress. Paul Marshall said he is grateful to be with his wife and children, but what he calls a “broken system” has left them unsure whether or not to have another baby or even be left alone with one of their daughters.
“You get pregnant. You go to all of your appointments. You voice all of your concerns. You do everything you’re supposed to do as a parent and your child still dies. And the state tells you it’s your fault,” Sarah Marshall said. “I don’t understand why I live in a world like that.”

Jim Pillen, center, greets State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. June 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has officially approved emergency rules and regulations for a regulatory commission to begin licensing medical cannabis establishments no later than Oct. 1.
The regulations had to go into effect Tuesday, based on deadlines overwhelmingly imposed by voters last November when Nebraskans legalized medical cannabis up to 5 ounces with any health care practitioner’s recommendation. Voters also approved a new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission to have the “exclusive” power to regulate the new medicine.
After reviewing the emergency regulations, Pillen signed them Sunday. That means the commission narrowly meets its July 1 deadline to impose criteria to accept or deny licensing applications. Licensing must begin by Oct. 1, under state law.
  Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers holds up an amendment to Legislative Bill 677 that seeks to help implement medical cannabis regulations in the state.

Pillen on Tuesday pointed to a legal agreement the Medical Cannabis Commission also entered into Thursday with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and Pillen’s Policy Research Office, the governor’s lobbying arm. At least some advocates have voiced concern about the involvement of DHHS for broad “legal services,” including general rulemaking.
Pillen’s office said the agencies “will ensure Nebraska’s new cannabis industry is properly regulated as outlined in the ballot initiatives passed by voters and signed by him into law.”
The emergency guidelines go into effect for up to 90 days, through Sept. 28, and can be extended, if needed, for one more 90-day period. However, Pillen and members of the Medical Cannabis Commission plan to move forward with formal regulations by Oct. 1.
The commission is soliciting public feedback on the emergency regulations by July 15 at lcc.frontdesk@nebraska.gov.
Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist who chairs the Medical Cannabis Commission, sent a letter to Pillen relaying the emergency regulations and stating that the “failure” to adopt them by the July 1 deadline “would force Nebraskans to seek medical cannabis or similar products from unregulated and potentially harmful sources.”
Justification for emergency regulations under state law can include “imminent peril” to public health, safety or welfare.
Application requirements
Under the emergency guidelines, anyone could apply for a cultivator, product manufacturer, dispensary or transporter license. An individual or business could be awarded only one license type, which would each also have strict record-keeping requirements.

Licenses could be granted for two years with a chance for renewal and would be non-transferable. Licenses may be denied for “good cause.”
Applicants would need to meet the following criteria for all license types:

Ownership: At least 51% of the ownership of an application must be Nebraska residents and U.S. citizens for at least the past four years.
Finger printing: At least two sets of fingerprints for anyone included in the application must be sent to the FBI through the Nebraska State Patrol for a national criminal history record information check. A fee must be paid to the State Patrol.
Location: Licensed establishments could not be within 1,000 feet of any existing school, daycare, church or hospital.
Prohibited persons: No one who has been convicted of any felony or any controlled substance-related offense within the past 10 years is eligible for the application. No state or local government can apply for the, nor can any health care practitioner who has issued one or more written recommendations for medical cannabis in the past five years. Only adults can apply for a license.

There is no deadline for applications to be submitted, and there is also no clear destination for them to be submitted to.
Dispensary and product restrictions
There could be no more than one dispensary in each of the state’s 12 District Court Judicial Districts, which lawmakers and advocates have said might be too few. 
That would mean one dispensary each in Douglas County (584,526 residents), Lancaster County (322,608 residents), Sarpy/Cass Counties (217,202 residents) and Buffalo/Hall Counties (112,979 residents), according to 2020 census data for Nebraska.
Those restrictions would allow no more than five dispensaries to cover more than half of the state’s 93 counties west of Grand Island (Hall County) or Kearney (Buffalo County).

The regulations would allow dispensaries to sell: 

Oral tablets, capsules or tinctures.
Non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, gelatinous rectangular cuboids or lozenges in a cube or rectangular cuboid shape.
Gels, oils, creams or other topical preparations
Suppositories.
Transdermal patches.
Liquids or oils for administration using a nebulizer or inhaler.

Dispensaries could not sell raw plant or flower, food or drinks with cannabis infused into it (edibles), any products containing artificial or natural flavoring or coloring and any products administered by smoking, combustion or vaping.
A dispensary could only obtain cannabis products from licensed Nebraska cultivators, transporters or manufacturers.
Packaging would need to be able to show whether it had been tampered with and be child-resistant, resealable and protected from contamination.
Similar to 2024 restrictions on vaping products, cannabis products could not depict cartoon-like fictional characters or mimic characters primarily aimed at entertaining minors, trademarks or trade dress or products that imitate or mimic products primarily marketed to minors, symbols primarily used to market products to minors or the images and likenesses of celebrities.
Until establishments are licensed, medical cannabis products can’t be legally purchased in Nebraska. Many advocates have turned to surrounding states for products as well as health care recommendations, as some Nebraska providers refuse to recommend cannabis. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services hasn’t issued any guidance.
The emergency regulations would require that a health care practitioner’s recommendation specify the product being recommended, the recommended dosage and potency, the number of doses, the directions for use and the name of the patient.
State lawmakers rejected multiple efforts in May to shield health care practitioners from civil, criminal or professional penalties solely for recommending medical cannabis.
What comes next?
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who tried to enact additional legislative guardrails around the commission this spring, with the support of advocates, said the “proof” will be “in the pudding” based on what formal regulations look like, not the emergency regulations.
Hansen has also repeatedly voiced concerns about the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office having threatened to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission as soon as it begins issuing licenses. Hansen questioned how much those lawsuits and others might cost taxpayers.

While Pillen has not outright joined Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers in his legal challenges of marijuana, both have questioned the validity of the medical cannabis laws in part because the federal government designates marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance.
Thirty-nine other states allow cannabis for medical use, and 24 of those states have also legalized recreational marijuana use. Washington, D.C., has legalized both. Advocates have pointed to the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as uplifting the rights of states, and of Nebraska voters, to make their voices heard on marijuana policies.
When formal regulations are released this summer, regardless of how similar they are to the emergency rules, there will be a public comment period and an in-person hearing. Formal guidelines would go to Hilgers and his office for legal review and then to Pillen.
“The input that the public provides on these emergency regulations will help us immediately begin drafting the regular regulations,” Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, an addiction prevention specialist through Heartland Family Service, said last week.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the campaign that ushered the laws through the 2024 election, said Tuesday that the commission has “failed on day one” by prohibiting the sale of whole-plant cannabis and limiting permissible methods of using cannabis under the regulations. Eggers said the ballot measures were clear on what Nebraskans and that “any attempt to dilute access or restrict parts of the plant is both unacceptable and unlawful.”
“We, the patients, families, caregivers, voters and citizens, will not be silent while this Commission defies its clear mandate. It is not their role to rewrite or reinterpret what the people have already decided. This Commission was created by and for the people of Nebraska, and it must answer to them,” Eggers said in a statement. “Let me be clear: This blatant disregard of their duty and the law will not be tolerated.”
The next Medical Cannabis Commission meeting is currently set for Aug. 4.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement used the pretense of a national emergency to justify a secret, no-bid contract with CoreCivic that would pay the company $4.2 million per month to house detained immigrants at its vacant Leavenworth prison.
CoreCivic revealed in court filings the amount of money it stands to lose if the city of Leavenworth prevails in legal proceedings aimed at blocking the company from reopening its prison. But the details of the contract remain undisclosed.
ICE filed internal paperwork that outlines the agency’s “justification” for giving contracts to private companies without going through the normal bidding process or revealing the cost, citing President Donald Trump’s declaration of a “national emergency at the southern border.” The agency said the situation “poses significant public safety risks.”
The secrecy, cost and justification of the contract outraged immigration advocates who oppose CoreCivic’s plans to reopen the Leavenworth facility — because of the company’s track record of abuse and neglect of prisoners and the nationwide crackdown by masked ICE agents who show little regard for civil rights or the status of people they detain.
“We just want to say we can overpay billionaires to house human beings on civil law violations,” said Michael Sharma-Crawford, a Kansas City-based immigration attorney. “I just don’t even know where we go from here. I just don’t. I mean, everything is geared to making billionaires more billions and continuing to crush any dissidents and human rights along the way.”
Sharma-Crawford said residents deserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent.
“This isn’t a national emergency. You are entering into a contract for the housing of civil detainees,” he said. “There’s nothing secret about that. There’s no scientific knowledge. There is no tactical knowledge. There is nothing that is secret about what you’re paying to house people.”
 
The justification
ICE published its “justification” document April 7 under the category of “unusual and compelling urgency.” The document references a five-year commitment to pay unnamed companies to operate nine facilities that combined would have 10,312 beds, including 1,000 in Kansas. The cost of the secret contracts is redacted.
The document notes that “many jurisdictions” have refused to work with ICE in recent years, making the agency increasingly reliant on private companies. An open competition for bids would take a year to complete, the document said.
“ICE does not have the time for the competitive process to be completed to procure more beds,” the document said. “Increased detention capacity is needed immediately to avoid the release by ICE of a significant numbers of aliens into United States.”
CoreCivic operated a federal pretrial prison in Leavenworth for more than two decades. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in 2021 described the facility, with its routine violence and lengthy lockdowns, as “an absolute hell hole.” The facility closed on Jan. 1, 2022, when President Joe Biden’s administration ended contracts with private prisons.
The city of Leavenworth filed a lawsuit to block CoreCivic from reopening the facility as an immigration detention center. The city argues that company should seek a permit, which could require the company maintain certain standards at the facility. A state district court judge issued a temporary injunction blocking CoreCivic from reopening the facility while the matter is being litigated.
The company asked the judge in a June 13 court filing to reconsider the temporary injunction.
“CoreCivic has a Contract with ICE under which it stands to lose approximately $4.2 million in monthly revenue if the Court maintains the temporary injunction,” the court filing said.
Ryan Gustin, a spokesman for CoreCivic, said the company is “pursuing all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter.”
“CoreCivic has been actively marketing our Leavenworth facility for years,” he said. “We stay in regular contact with ICE and all our government partners to understand their changing needs, and we work within their established procurement processes. Any questions about our contractual relationship with ICE should be directed to ICE Public Affairs.”
ICE Public Affairs didn’t respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry.
 
Profit from pain
Micah Kubic, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the deal between ICE and CoreCivic “reflects a broader pattern of collusion between private corporations and their enablers in this presidential administration.”
“By circumventing its own requirements for contract bidding, ICE has essentially ensured that its favorites get hefty, federal contracts fueled by taxpayer dollars to fill their prisons, and we’ve seen how this money grab translates into reckless, at times horrifying conduct by masked, anonymous agents in our neighborhoods.”
Sharma-Crawford, the immigration attorney, said he has clients who were detained by ICE after they entered the country on a visa or immediately filed for asylum and were here lawfully. He said ICE agents were “grasping at straws to make numbers.”
Ashley Hernandez, organizing and policy coordinator for the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth’s Office of Justice, Peace, and Integrity of Creation, said the supposed national emergency is only “in people’s heads.”
“We’ve seen a lot of propaganda and a lot of hate speech that kind of drives that,” Hernandez said. “I think the national emergency, if we want to say there is one, is that there are people coming to our country seeking help, seeking a better life, and they’re fleeing the true national emergencies that are in their countries. They’re fleeing death. They’re fleeing sickness. They’re fleeing pain.”
She said it was “just insanity” to allow any company “to profit off of human pain.”
“As Catholics, as people of faith, we are called to treat everyone with dignity,” Hernandez said. “We are called to help the poor, help the sick, walk with the marginalized and be their voices. So our faith really calls us to make sure that this detention center doesn’t happen.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200573-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-01 11:18:34.004577

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) Members of the nation’s largest private-sector doctors union voted to authorize a strike if its negotiating team can’t reach a contract agreement with Allina Health. 
There is no timeline for a strike, according to a press release from Doctors Council Service Employees International Union. If the negotiating unit decides to call a strike, they must give Allina a 10-day notice. 
The doctors’ vote comes on the heels of nurses recently voting to authorize strikes. Some groups of nurses opted to call a strike just days after the authorization. 
Doctors Council SEIU includes doctors, nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants at 60 Allina primary and urgent care clinics in Minnesota plus one in Wisconsin. 
The workers picketed outside Allina Clinics last month — the first time in Minnesota history that doctors have picketed their employer. Physicians have not historically seen themselves as workers in need of a union. The consolidation of health care and productivity demands set by faraway bosses, however, has made many feel more like workers pushed to churn through patients on an assembly line rather than masters of their own practices.
The strike authorization was approved by 90% of the providers who voted. 
“We voted so strongly to authorize a strike because we are frustrated that we aren’t seeing movement on issues that matter most to our membership including sick time, vacation time, and time away to deal with the demanding job we do,” said Cora Walsh, family medicine provider at Allina West St. Paul and member of the Doctors Council bargaining team. 
In a statement, Allina Health said it has made “substantial progress” on contract negotiations with the union.

Republish photo only with original story.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed the state’s massive operating budget, including dozens of vetoes — axing provisions that would restrict books in libraries, take money away from public school savings, and make significant expansions to the private school voucher system.
At 11:15 p.m. Monday, DeWine announced he approved the $60-billion Republican spending bill. At 2:15 a.m., he sent out his 67 line-item vetoes.
These are some of the major items he cut. This list is not exhaustive, but you can find the full veto list here.
Education
The governor has vetoed several major items under the education portion of the budget.
He cut a provision that would have required public libraries to place books referencing “sexual orientation or gender” in an area away from the public. This means that even books that reference a female character in the title could be blocked, according to a Northeast Ohio librarian.
This kind of proposal has been brought up in previous years as a way to categorize LGBTQ+ content as “harmful” to minors.
DeWine also cut a provision that would have taken away some of the school districts’ savings, capping the carryover revenue at 40% and requiring anything above that mark be refunded to taxpayers. This could have bankrupted districts and multiple schools, the Ohio Education Association told us.
DeWine vetoed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
He removed a provision that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
He cut restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy.
He vetoed what would have been a win for “school choice” proponents. The budget would have provided about $2.5 billion over the biennium for the state’s voucher system, providing taxpayer dollars for students to attend nonchartered nonpublic schools — ones that already don’t receive state or federal funding.
This includes a new education savings account program, or ESAs, which is a way for families to get state money to purchase “educational goods and services,” including tuition at nonchartered, nonpublic schools. He rejected this.
He removed an item that would have restricted the amount of money the state could award to the Ohio Higher Education Research Public Policy Consortium, which analyzes policy challenges and researches the state’s priorities.
He vetoed an item that would have allowed the legislature to choose where school funding goes based on compliance with the Ohio Senate Bill 1 higher education overhaul law.
He cut a provision that would have required partisan labels on school board candidates.
Children
He vetoed an item that would have restricted funding from youth homeless shelters if they supported transgender or nonbinary identities.
Also, a cut to a provision requiring teenagers under the age of 18 who have been tried and convicted as adults to be committed to a Department of Youth Services facility instead of a Department of Rehabilitation and Correction facility.
Health
He vetoed a provision that would have restricted Medicaid for babies ages 0-3. This would have repealed the requirement for Medicaid to allow parents of children under the age of four to stay enrolled in Medicaid through a federal waiver.
He removed a provision that requires Medicaid to randomly assign a managed care plan for all individuals who do not choose a specific managed care plan.
He cut an item that puts reporting requirements on entities participating in the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program.
He cut an item that would have stopped SNAP for “sugar-sweetened beverages.”
Due to a drafting error, he cut a provision that was intended to regulate the practice of pharmacy benefit managers in Ohio and the requirements for fair and transparent reimbursement for Ohio pharmacies.
He vetoed an item that would prevent the Ohio Department of Health from requiring soil evaluators or soil scientists to assess soil type and slope for Household Treatment Sewage Systems.
He cut a provision requiring a hospital with a maternity unit that accepts Medicaid to enter into a transfer agreement with any freestanding birthing center located within a 30-mile radius that requests one.
Land and energy
He vetoed a provision that would have put restrictions on what H2Ohio, DeWine’s clean water program, can do. It would have stopped their ability to use funds to purchase land or conservation easements.
He stopped an item that would have prevented state and local governments from using eminent domain to obtain property for the construction of recreational trails.
He cut an item that could have delayed the amount of time a lessee has to actually produce on a well and generate royalty payments for the state.
He removed a provision creating the Oil and Gas Resolution and Remediation Fund for the purposes of plugging orphaned oil and gas wells in the state.
He vetoed an item that prohibits the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, when contracting with a third party, from requiring dredge operators to hold any licenses, registrations, or certifications when dredging in waters of the state.
He cut a provision that makes certain electric transmission costs avoidable by customers who shop for their electric energy provider.
He removed an item that would have prohibited the Tax Credit Authority from entering into new computer data center sales and use tax exemption agreements.
Administrative
He vetoed a provision that would have required state employees to work in the office full time.
He cut an item that would have created the Election Integrity Unit within the Secretary of State’s Office and directed the Unit to investigate alleged violations of elections law.
He removed a provision limiting the types of flags permitted to be displayed on state-owned buildings and property to include only the Ohio flag, U.S. flag, POW/MIA flag, and flags of official state agencies as approved by the governor.
He cut an item that would prohibit local school boards from entering into supplemental benefit arrangements to pay employee contributions to the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio (STRS) on behalf of superintendents and principals.
Taxes
He vetoed a provision changing the tax structure surrounding marijuana sales. Currently, it is taxed through an excise tax; however, this item would have applied a sales tax to the excise tax.
He cut an item requiring Ashtabula County to repeal a 2% special lodging tax used to fund the costs of a convention center.
He vetoed a provision that would sunset the film and theater production tax credit program by prohibiting the award of the tax credit.
What is next?
The governor is holding a press conference to explain his decisions at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
Lawmakers have the opportunity to do line-item veto overrides, but that would require them to come back from break. Three-fifths of each chamber would be required to do so.

Health groups are warning that the revived proposal for a wood-burning plant in Springfield could roll back years of progress in fighting the high rates of asthma in the city.  
The post Health advocates warn proposed wood-burning plant in Springfield will worsen asthma rates appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A PROPOSAL TO build a wood-burning power plant in Springfield is back in play after recent court rulings, but health advocates warn it could worsen the city’s already high asthma rates. 
Palmer Renewable Energy first proposed the project in 2008. The company received permits from the city and state to build a biomass power plant, but since then, advocates, residents, public health experts, local officials, and legislators have fought against the project. In spring 2021, Massachusetts’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) revoked its permit. Springfield officials argue the permits granted by the city have expired. However, a Superior Court judge ruled in January that the state-issued air permit is still valid, and the state Appeals Court ruled in May that the local building permits issued by the city are also valid. 
The rulings allow the company to move forward with the biomass power plant which would burn wood and other organic material for energy.  
The company can leverage a provision in the 2021 climate law that permits wood-burning power plants to sell renewable energy credits to municipal light plants beginning in 2026. While the state mandates that electric utilities source a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable energy, biomass power plants are not considered eligible under those rules. However, the 2021 law established a separate requirement for municipality-owned utilities, specifically including biomass as a qualifying clean energy source. 
The attorneys who represented Palmer Renewable Energy did not respond to a request for comment on the company’s court victories. 
Health advocates argued at a virtual event last week – organized by the Public Health Institute of Western Massachusetts, the Pioneer Valley Asthma Coalition, and the Healthy Air Network – that adding a biomass plant would roll back the progress that the city has made in reducing its asthma rates. 
Opponents of the project – represented by the Conservation Law Foundation – are appealing the decision to the Supreme Judicial Court. They are also advocating for a legislative change proposed by Sen. Adam Gomez of Springfield that would remove wood-burning plants from the state’s definition of non-carbon-emitting sources for municipal plants.  
Springfield was designated the “asthma capital” of the country in 2019 and had the fourth highest asthma rate in the nation in 2024, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.  
Gomez, who has opposed the project since he was a Springfield city councilor, called the inclusion of biomass in the 2021 law as a source of clean energy for municipal light plants a “loophole.” Emissions from a biomass plant are up to 2.8 times higher than emissions from sources like oil or coal. These types of power plants release harmful air pollutants like particulate matter and dioxins.  
Wood-burning plants have been pitched as a carbon-neutral energy source, based on the idea that any carbon released will be recaptured by new trees. However, scientists question whether this process is truly carbon neutral, since it can take decades for trees to grow enough to offset the carbon emissions. 
“If we don’t close the loophole, this polluting facility may finally have the financial lifeline it needs to become a reality, and we need to stop it now,” Gomez said at the event last week. “The bill is not just about words on a page; it’s about shutting off the flow of public dollars and clean energy subsidies to a facility that has no business being called green.” 
Gomez’s proposal is included in the larger energy affordability bill that Gov. Maura Healey proposed in May to lower energy costs across the state.  
Sarita Hudson, a senior director at the Public Health Institute of Western Massachusetts, said at the virtual event that Springfield has improved its air quality and asthma rates over the last 10 years, but that there are many reasons why Springfield tends to have bad air quality. The city has two major highways, industrial facilities, and hosted a fossil fuel-burning power plant up until 2022. And, because Springfield sits in a valley, air pollution gets trapped there. 
Springfield residents have been fighting the biomass plant ever since the project was proposed, according to Michael Fenton, Springfield’s city council president. “Our opposition has really been throughout all the decades,” he said.  
Gomez called the proposed facility a “zombie plant.” He said, “No matter how many times it’s defeated, it keeps coming back to life.”  
Springfield residents and advocates mobilized against the project as soon as the City Council first issued the special permit to Palmer in 2008. The council initially approved the permit because the power plant would bring 50 full-time jobs and up to $1 million in tax revenue for the city. The company also promised to provide other benefits to the city, such as $667,000 in infrastructure improvements and $25,000 for a “green energy education” program in public schools. 
After opposition to the power plant mounted, the city council in 2011 revoked the special permit for the biomass project, but the city’s building commissioner issued separate building permits that Palmer said were adequate for the project to move forward. In 2018, Palmer announced its intentions to break ground on the project, but the city, backed by the Zoning Board of Appeals, argued the permits had expired.  
This year, both the air and the building permits have been revived through the state’s Superior Court and Appeals Court decisions.  
“To be honest, I thought this issue was long gone,” said Gomez. “We’ve written letters, we’ve organized meetings, we’ve marched, we’ve testified, we’ve rallied, we’ve sued. … But now we find ourselves here once again facing the revived threat of the Palmer Renewable Energy Biomass Plant.”

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent/States Newsroom.)It seems little will change about the budget when it comes to child care, after Gov. Mike DeWine’s 67 total vetoes didn’t include changes specifically related to child care provisions.
The budget sent to DeWine by an Ohio General Assembly joint conference committee last week and signed at 11:15 p.m. on Monday brought back a cost-sharing model for child care, funded a subsidy program through federal dollars, and created a child care recruitment and mentorship grant program.
But it also held state-funded child care at current levels and changed the way in which child care providers are paid, in a way that advocates say will negatively impact the sector.
Early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio said the budget secured “modest wins” but ultimately “fails to meet the moment for Ohio’s youngest.”
Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of Groundwork said the organization is “hopeful that – even in a challenging fiscal and political environment – the final budget keeps Ohio moving with intention toward the goals set forth by Governor DeWine to improve outcomes for young children and families.”
But “the path forward is uncertain,” the group said in a statement.
“Without new action, Ohio will face a $600 million shortfall in child care funding next biennium as one-time federal dollars dry up,” the statement read.
Child care organizations across the state urged the governor over the last week to veto certain parts of the budget that they said would create even more challenges in a struggling child care sector.
“The governor has long styled himself as a man who defends children,” said Policy Matters Executive Director Hannah Halbert in a statement. “This bill harms them.”
Ohio House Republicans said the final budget draft would help more Ohioans cover the cost of child care services, and with increases in child development programs like Help Me Grow, would invest in “a system of supports for pregnant women, caregivers with new babies and families with young children with developmental delays and disabilities.”

Ohio House Democrats sent a letter to the governor on Friday discrediting the budget provisions related to child care, among other things.
“Instead of funding our public schools or helping parents afford child care or health care, or pay for groceries, diapers, rent, and any other costs, this budget prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthiest few and Medicaid cuts for babies and the elderly,” the letter stated.
Dr. John Stanford, state director for the Children’s Defense Fund, urged DeWine to use his vetoes to support children in several ways, including preserving Medicaid coverage for infants, safeguarding access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and rejecting Medicaid changes.
He said the budget as passed by the joint committee “sends a clear message to Ohio’s children and families: you are not the priority.”
DeWine did veto the legislature’s provision repealing continuous Medicaid coverage for children under the age of four, saying the the coverage “is consistent with the DeWine-Tressel Administration’s longstanding pro-life and pro-family agenda and is critical to making Ohio the best place in the nation to raise a family.”
“At a time when families are struggling to access child care, health coverage, poverty relief and safe housing, lawmakers have chosen to deliver tax breaks to the wealthy and handouts to stadium developers,” Stanford said in a statement. “This budget robs children of their chance to grow up with dignity, hope and joy.”
  What’s in the budget: Child care edition
Legislators left the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility at 145% of the federal poverty level, something that had been high on advocates’ list of items to change.
Groundwork Ohio and other organizations had hoped to see that level increased to at least 160%, if not 200% of the poverty line, to allow Ohio to increase access to child care.
Keeping the eligibility at its current level leaves the state at one of the lowest eligibility levels in the country, according to experts and the leader of the Ohio Department of Children and Youth.
The Child Care Cred Program, a new provision that was originally a GOP-sponsored set of bills introduced in the last General Assembly and the current one, was included in the final draft of the budget.
The move in conference committee brought the program back, with a $10 million appropriation, after it had been removed by the Senate.
The program was presented as a way to begin the process of improving the child care system in Ohio by allowing costs to be shared among employers, employees and the state in a 40%-40%-20% split respectively.
Child care policy analysts in Ohio said the program had “lackluster” results in other states where it’s been attempted.
Also included in the budget was the DeWine-supported Child Care Choice Voucher Program, which originally was funded through just general revenue funds, but will now receive $50 million each over the next two years in federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds.
A grant program to support child care recruitment and mentorship will receive $1 million in 2026 and $1.85 million in 2027. But that’s a cut from the total of $3.2 million set aside in the House budget draft. The Senate had offered $2.75 million total in their version.
Two new provisions related to child care worker pay caused several advocates to plead for vetoes from the governor.
The conference committee inserted provisions in the Ohio Department of Children and Youth budget, which change the payment categories and time increments for Publicly Funded Child Care.
Under the budget bill, the categories would start with an “hourly” category of less than 10 hours a week of child care, a “part-time” category for between 10 and 33 hours per week, and a “full-time” category for providers giving more than 33 hours per week of child care.
Currently, hourly payments are made for child care of less than seven hours, part-time is considered between seven and 25 hours, and full-time is 25 to 60 hours per week.
“There would likely be a reduction in payments for those children served in modified categories,” the budget documents stated.
Advocates including Tamara Lunan, director of the Care Economy Organizing Project, which focuses its advocacy work on child care and early education, said not only will there be a reduction in payments, but the line item “will negatively impact an entire industry.”
“Small businesses live and die on cash flow,” Lunan said in a letter to DeWine asking for vetoes of the provisions. “…Indeed, it’s not hard to see why changing the hour categories in such a way may ultimately turn away children or cause other capacity issues simply due to the shift in value based on seemingly random threshold shifts.”
The second line-item revised family child care home rate payments, “aligning” licensed child care providers who serve seven to 12 children in their homes (Type A centers) with those who serve one to six children (Type B centers).
The changes from the two provisions “would force more providers out of business,” according to Policy Matters’ Halbert, and would “effectively eliminate the thousands of dollars that they put into their business expansions to be a larger provider,” Lunan said of Type A centers.
“We need more providers to expand – not contract – but this language disincentivizes home providers who have worked diligently to grow their businesses,” Lunan said.

Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, neither of whom has said publicly how they’ll vote.Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis have already said they won’t approve the legislation, and with a narrow 53-seat majority, GOP leaders cannot afford both Collins and Murkowski to oppose the bill.

Murkowski and Majority Whip John Barrasso, of Wyoming, left the chamber to catch an elevator together just after 9:30 a.m. Eastern.Asked if the bill was in the hands of the parliamentarian, Murkowski quipped, ""I think it's in the hands of the people that operate the coffee machine.""Barrasso said ""Yes” when asked if it would pass this morning.Vice President JD Vance, who arrived at the Capitol building shortly after sunrise, can, if needed, break a 50-50 tie in favor of sending the measure to the House for final approval. If all four Republican senators vote no, leadership would have to go back to the drawing board on various policy changes in the bill. But any alterations directed at getting their votes could alienate other Republican senators, potentially further changing the whip count.Failing to pass the package sometime Tuesday or even Wednesday would likely lead to Republicans missing their self-imposed Fourth of July deadline for having the legislation to President Donald Trump for his signature.Trump weighs inTrump told reporters on Tuesday morning before leaving for a Florida visit to the “Alligator Alcatraz” immigrant detention site that “it's very complicated stuff” when asked about Senate Republicans’ debate over spending cuts.“We're going to have to see the final version. I don't want to go too crazy with cuts. I don't like cuts. There are certain things that have been cut, which is good. I think we're doing well,” Trump said. “We're going to have to see, it’s some very complicated stuff. Great enthusiasm as you know. And I think in the end we're going to have it.”The heart of the nearly 1,000-page legislation extends and expands the 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level and makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs.The bill would also put in motion some of Trump's campaign promises, including no tax on qualifying tips, overtime or car loan interest, but only for a few years.And it slashes spending on the Medicaid program for low-income people and some people with disabilities as well as shifting significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time.Once the Senate passes the measure, it will have to go back to the House for a final vote, and even if that happens, approval is far from guaranteed.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can only lose four Republicans if all lawmakers in that chamber attend the vote. Several GOP members have voiced frustration with how the Senate has reworked the legislation, signaling an uphill climb for the bill.House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith said as he left the Senate cloakroom just after 9:20 a.m. Eastern that lawmakers are “getting closer to a bill signing on July Fourth.”“If you followed this journey over the last six months, over and over, people said that we could not accomplish a budget (reconciliation bill). We did. They said we would never pass it out of the House. We did. The Senate is going to pass it. The House is going to pass it, and the president's going to sign it into law,” the Missouri Republican said.Three amendments succeedThe Senate had adopted three amendments to the bill following an all-night amendment voting session, known as a vote-a-rama.Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn was able to remove language from the package that would have blocked state and local governments from regulating artificial intelligence for five years if they wanted access to a $500 million fund. That vote was 99-1 with only North Carolina’s Tillis voting to keep the language in the package.Blackburn said the change was necessary because lawmakers in Congress have “proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology.”Senators approved an amendment from Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst by voice vote that would disqualify “anyone making a million dollars or more from being eligible for unemployment income support.”Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy was able to get an amendment adopted by a voice vote that would move up the date when Medicaid administrators must begin checking the Social Security Administration’s death master file to determine if a new enrollee is alive before adding them to the health program. It was set to begin on Jan. 1, 2028, but will now begin one year earlier.Senators rejected dozens of amendments offered by both Democrats and Republicans, some of which deadlocked on 50-50 votes. Maine’s Collins and Alaska’s Murkowski broke with their party several times to vote with Democrats.National private school voucher programHawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono tried to eliminate a sweeping private school voucher program that’s baked into the reconciliation package, but that vote failed 50-50. Collins, Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer and Murkowski voted in support.The original proposal called for $4 billion a year in tax credits beginning in 2027 for people donating to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships.But the parliamentarian last week deemed the program to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, forcing senators to rework the program.Details on the finalized version of the program remain unknown as the final bill text has not been released.  Safety funding for Virginia airport across from DCVirginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner tried to add language to the bill that would have increased safety funding for airports near Washington, D.C., and established a memorial for the victims who died in a crash this January. The vote failed on a tied 50-50 vote, with Collins, Kansas GOP Sen. Jerry Moran and Murkowski voting with Democrats in support.“Colleagues, we all know that on January 29 of this year, 67 individuals lost their lives when a military helicopter and a passenger jet collided near Reagan National Airport. This tragedy underscores the need for more safety improvements at National Airport,” Warner said. “The reconciliation bill increases, actually doubles, the amount of rent that National and Dulles pay the government but doesn’t use any of that money to make those airports and the people who use them any safer.”He argued there was “no good rationale for increasing those rents and not using them for aviation safety.”Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke against Warner’s amendment, saying the rents for the two airports in Virginia near the nation’s capital haven’t been updated in decades.“The federal government originally calculated the rent in 1987 at $7.5 million dollars, massively below market rates,” Cruz said. “This bill increases that to $15 million, still dramatically below market rates.”Cruz — chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation — said the legislation includes $12.5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration to “transform the air traffic control system” and said his panel is looking into the collision in order to prevent something similar from happening again. Trump budget director’s office targetedMaryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen also got within one vote of having an amendment adopted when he tried to remove a section from the bill that would increase funding for the White House budget office by $100 million.“This is at a time when (Federal Emergency Management Agency) grants to many of our states have been canceled, grants for law enforcement have been frozen, grants for victims of crimes are on hold,” Van Hollen said. “That is not efficiency. That is creating chaos and uncertainty. And I ask my colleagues, why in the world would we want to send another $100 million to OMB?”Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson opposed the efforts, saying “the Office of Management and Budget needs to identify budgeting and accounting efficiencies in the executive branch. They need the resources to do it.”The amendment was not added to the bill following another tied 50-50 vote with Collins, Murkowski and Paul voting with Democrats in favor.Had GOP leadership wanted either of those proposals added to the package, they could have had Vance break the tie, but they did not.Collins loses vote on rural hospital fundMaine’s Collins tried to get an amendment added to the legislation that would have increased “funding for the rural health care provider fund to $50 billion dollars and expand the list of eligible providers to include not only rural hospitals but also community health centers, nursing homes, ambulance services, skilled nursing facilities and others.”Collins said the additional $25 billion in funding for the fund would be paid for by “a modest increase in the top marginal tax rate, equal to the pre-2017 rate for individuals with income above $25 million and married couples with income above $50 million.”Collins’ amendment was subject to a Senate procedural limit known as a budget point of order. She was unable to get the votes needed to waive that on a 22-78 vote.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden spoke against Collins’ proposal, calling it “flawed,” and introduced the budget point of order against her amendment.“The danger Senate Republicans are causing for rural hospitals is so great, Republicans have had to create a rural hospital relief fund so they can look like they are fixing the problem they are causing,” Wyden said. “It is a Band-Aid on an amputation. It provides just a tiny fraction of the nearly $1 trillion in cuts the bill makes to Medicaid. It would be much more logical to simply not cut $1 trillion from Medicaid in the first place.”Collins received a mix of support from Republicans, including West Virginia Shelley Moore Capito, Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, Utah’s John Curtis, Nebraska’s Fischer, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, Missouri’s Josh Hawley, Ohio’s Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, Mississippi’s Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker, Louisiana’s Kennedy, Kansans Roger Marshall and Moran, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, Alaskans Dan Sullivan and Murkowski and Indiana’s Todd Young.Also voting to waive the point of order and move forward with the amendment were Georgia’s Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Virginia’s Warner, all Democrats, and independent Maine Sen.

Ron Johnson opposed the efforts, saying “the Office of Management and Budget needs to identify budgeting and accounting efficiencies in the executive branch. They need the resources to do it.”The amendment was not added to the bill following another tied 50-50 vote with Collins, Murkowski and Paul voting with Democrats in favor.Had GOP leadership wanted either of those proposals added to the package, they could have had Vance break the tie, but they did not.Collins loses vote on rural hospital fundMaine’s Collins tried to get an amendment added to the legislation that would have increased “funding for the rural health care provider fund to $50 billion dollars and expand the list of eligible providers to include not only rural hospitals but also community health centers, nursing homes, ambulance services, skilled nursing facilities and others.”Collins said the additional $25 billion in funding for the fund would be paid for by “a modest increase in the top marginal tax rate, equal to the pre-2017 rate for individuals with income above $25 million and married couples with income above $50 million.”Collins’ amendment was subject to a Senate procedural limit known as a budget point of order. She was unable to get the votes needed to waive that on a 22-78 vote.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden spoke against Collins’ proposal, calling it “flawed,” and introduced the budget point of order against her amendment.“The danger Senate Republicans are causing for rural hospitals is so great, Republicans have had to create a rural hospital relief fund so they can look like they are fixing the problem they are causing,” Wyden said. “It is a Band-Aid on an amputation. It provides just a tiny fraction of the nearly $1 trillion in cuts the bill makes to Medicaid. It would be much more logical to simply not cut $1 trillion from Medicaid in the first place.”Collins received a mix of support from Republicans, including West Virginia Shelley Moore Capito, Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy, Utah’s John Curtis, Nebraska’s Fischer, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, Missouri’s Josh Hawley, Ohio’s Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, Mississippi’s Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker, Louisiana’s Kennedy, Kansans Roger Marshall and Moran, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, Alaskans Dan Sullivan and Murkowski and Indiana’s Todd Young.Also voting to waive the point of order and move forward with the amendment were Georgia’s Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Virginia’s Warner, all Democrats, and independent Maine Sen.

Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images. As you stare at Minnesota’s new state constellation, Ursa Minor, i.e., the Little Dipper, and consider the vast universe, you’ll also have to ponder this: The tax on your weed is going up. 
The constellation and cannabis tax hike are two of the new laws taking effect July 1. 
Most were passed during the marathon 2025 special session, which resulted in a $66 billion two-year budget, effective Tuesday, the first of the new fiscal year. It’s an 8% decrease from the previous two years, which were boosted by federal pandemic aid. 
Funding to schools will increase by 4.8% over the next two years, though the budget makes cuts to special education and other programs. 
The education budget allocates a one-time total of $55 million for state aid linked to low-income students and nearly $23 million for “Grow Your Own” programs that recruit local community members to increase teacher diversity. 
In anticipation of the projected 2028-2029 budget deficit, the Legislature decreased state reimbursement for special education student transportation. Federal law will require districts to make up the difference. 
After a years-long legislative battle, optometrists will now be able to perform some procedures previously reserved for ophthalmologists. 
The cannabis tax rate is increasing from 10% to 15%, nearly a month after Minnesota’s first cannabis license lottery, which is another step in the seemingly interminable process of non-tribal cannabis stores opening. 
Several new provisions will go into effect to address fraud, which has beset state government programs in recent years. A state agency can now withhold payments for up to 60 days if there is sufficient evidence of fraud; lawmakers expanded whistleblower protections for state employees; and staff who work in grants management will need new training. 
In lieu of more substantive regulations on homeowners’ associations — which have been repeatedly accused of slapping homeowners with giant, surprise bills — legislators created a community ombudsperson to mediate conflicts between HOAs and tenants. Good luck, though: The ombudsperson will not have the power to enforce any agreements.
Attention influencers! A new law will regulate when minors can appear in online content and how they get paid. It requires creators who post money-earning content with minors to compensate them using a trust account. Children under 14 are prohibited from appearing in more than 30% of a content creator’s videos. 
Some consumer products and other substances will now be exempt from regulations that prohibit PFAS. 
PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, were banned in most products because of the chemicals’ serious health impacts. The newly exempt items include internal components of products, children’s recreational vehicles such as electric bicycles, and firefighting foam in airport hangars. 
The state’s ban on lead was modified to exclude keys with lead that are sold before July 1, 2028 or have 1.5% or less lead by weight. The lead ban had set off a panic among small businesses, which said they couldn’t acquire keys under the old rules. 
New laws increase the penalties for assaulting a firefighter; extend the statute of limitations on arson; and add streetlights, among other items, to the crime of destruction of public utilities, in a bid to combat theft of copper wiring. 
Check your mirrors: Motorcycles can now drive between vehicles, including through traffic jams. 
Finally, about that new state constellation, Ursa Minor, also known as the Little Dipper. The North Star is located at the tip of the Little Dipper, making the constellation an apt choice for the “North Star State.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/weed-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-01 10:02:55.671349

Seven states have enacted bans on lab-grown meat. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Texas is the fifth state this year and seventh overall to ban lab-grown meat after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation temporarily prohibiting the sale of cell-cultured protein.
Selling lab-grown meat, which is produced by growing cells acquired from living animals in a controlled environment, will be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the new law.
It is set to go into effect in September and expires in two years.
“This ban is a massive win for Texas ranchers, producers, and consumers,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “Texans have a God-given right to know what’s on their plate, and for millions of Texans, it better come from a pasture, not a lab. It’s plain cowboy logic that we must safeguard our real, authentic meat industry from synthetic alternatives.”
Bill requiring lab-grown food to be clearly labeled advances in SC

Consumers interested in sustainable foods that avoid the slaughter of animals are driving the growing cultured meat industry.
The Texas beef industry supported the bill. The state leads the nation in cattle, contributing almost 15% of U.S. beef production, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Texas joins Indiana, Mississippi, Montana and Nebraska in enacting new laws this year prohibiting the sale of lab-grown meat; Alabama and Florida did so last year. In March, the Oklahoma House approved a similar bill that later died in the Senate.
Rather than ban sales, South Carolina law requires clear labeling of any “artificial or cell-cultivated food product.” Gov. Henry McMaster signed the mandate into law in May after the legislation passed both chambers unanimously.
Supported by South Carolina farmers, the legislation expanded on existing state law that says cell-cultivated food can’t be labeled as “meat” or “clean meat.”
“At some point a chicken walks and clucks and does the things that chickens do,” state Sen. Everett Stubbs, R-Rock Hill, told his colleagues as the bill advanced in January. “Quite frankly, I have a problem with this product being labeled chicken.”
South Carolina law makes mislabeling the products punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or up to a year in prison. Each package not clearly labeled is a separate offense.
Texas followed Indiana’s lead in making its ban last for two years, which Indiana legislators said would allow more time for research. The time limit also may mean the law is less likely to draw legal challenges.
Upside Foods, one of the companies federally approved to sell cultivated meat, sued Florida shortly after the state passed the country’s first lab-grown meat ban. That lawsuit is pending.
In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave permission to two California-based companies to begin selling lab-produced chicken across the country. Their lab-grown chicken was briefly featured on the menu at two restaurants that same year.
Although cultivated meat isn’t sold in stores yet, some research suggests it could be better for the environment compared with traditional meat production.
But other research suggests lab-grown meat’s environmental impact could be higher than retail beef based on current production methods.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states, including Maine, are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm.
The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government’s use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews.
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads.
In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration’s position.
“In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America’s energy industry stifled by Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said.
While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing.

The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint.
To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects.
The states other than Maine filing the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

(Photo: U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance)Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions have asked a Rhode Island federal judge to halt the Trump administration’s new restrictions for grants administered by an office within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Violence Against Women Act.
The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.
“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request.
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.
Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.



North Carolina impact
The complaint states that the Durham-based North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence has been receiving grant funding of the kind endangered by the new Trump administration rules for a quarter-century. According to the lawsuit:
“The North Carolina Coalition has received a Coalition Grant each year since at least 2001 and is currently operating under the FY24 Coalition Grant, which provides a total of $113,574 through September 30, 2025.”
The suit notes further that the North Carolina group has also received (and intends to apply going forward) for the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women’s Disability Grant and Rural Program Grant — both of which are subject to the new administration grant conditions.

$1 million in grants awarded to Rhode Island annually
The Rhode Island Coalition has an annual budget of roughly $5.3 million, of which approximately $3.4 million is passed through to member agencies. Roughly $1 million of that comes from Office on Violence Against Women grants, the coalition’s executive director, Lucy Rios, stated in an affidavit.
Federal grants and contracts accounted for 79% of the coalition’s revenue, according to its annual report.
The coalition has received grant funding in various program categories every year since at least 2001. It has sought training and technical assistance grants and other competitive discretionary grants, including $114,533 awarded for the period Oct. 1, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025. The lawsuit was filed ahead of a June 25 deadline to apply for a fiscal 2025 training and technical assistance grant that was anticipated in the amount of $113,574.
Rhode Island received $550,000 from the OVW in 2022 to create a safe visitation and exchange program for domestic violence survivors and their children — along with LGBTQ-related advocacy. The coalition also received a $350,000 grant to educate young men — particularly youth of color and immigrant communities — on the crimes of domestic and dating violence.
The coalition sought to continue the programs with additional grant funding, along with $900,000 to be used toward identifying potential high-risk cases for supervision and monitoring, according to the affidavit.
“Without access to this funding, vital programs that keep Rhode Islanders safe and keep our state at the forefront of addressing domestic violence are at risk, including RI’s first Safe Exchange and Supervised Visitation Center for families experiencing domestic violence,” Rios said in a June 16 statement. “We strive to be as courageous and resilient as the survivors in our communities as we stand up to protect the safety net for victims and infrastructure for prevention that we have been collectively building for nearly 50 years.”
A spokesperson for the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The group of state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions includes the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence; California Partnership to End Domestic Violence; Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault; DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence; End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin: The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence; Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Jane Doe Inc.

The group’s $238,700 contract to conduct an economic-impact study will help the state determine “whether or when the state will be required to issue additional cannabis facility licenses and, if so, how many, where, and of what type,” according to a March press release from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
Currently, Missouri allows only the minimum number of cannabis licenses required by the constitutional amendments that legalized medical and, subsequently, recreational marijuana for adults.
As a result, the department has issued nearly 400 licenses for cultivation, manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. There are, for example, 24 dispensary licenses of each type in each of the state’s eight congressional districts. Some operators have medical and adult-use licenses for the same location.
The state will also eventually have 144 microbusiness licenses, which are limited in size and scope and meant to benefit disadvantaged business owners. 
In 2024, Missouri recorded $1.46 billion in total marijuana sales in the state’s second year of adult-use marijuana, outperforming states with a longer history of marijuana legalization like Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
“As it relates to cannabis markets, Missouri is pretty famously the model to follow,” Mackenzie Slade, the group’s CEO and owner, told The Independent in April. “So I’m very interested in doing a super deep dive.”
  Mackenzie Slade is owner of New York-based Cannabis Public Policy Consulting LLC, which Missouri contracted to study the state’s marijuana industry. (Screenshot of a Maryland cannabis report Slade authored.)
Three companies were vying for the contract this spring. One applicant, Oregon-based Whitney Economics, conducts cannabis studies globally but failed to meet one of the requirements regarding managers, according to the state’s bid evaluation. 
The other was St. Louis-based Capital Consulting Services, a certified Missouri minority-owned business enterprise, that has helped governments with economic feasibility studies for 15 years on a state and federal level.  The group submitted a higher bid of $360,000 than Slade’s company and didn’t have as much experience studying cannabis markets.
Founded in 2019, Cannabis Public Policy Consulting is a “100% woman-owned collective of researchers, data scientists, public health professionals, and policy experts working together toward a unified goal: to bring much-needed data, innovation, and nuance to cannabis research and policymaking,” the contract states.
Before becoming an independent LLC, the group worked together as a consulting team incubated by Advocates for Human Potential, Inc. and have produced similar market reports for about 12 cannabis regulatory agencies over the last six years, the contract states. That includes the states of Maine, Maryland, Virginia, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Michigan and Utah.
“For a dozen government contracts, CPPC has performed the exact same scope of services as outlined in the RFP; supply and demand assessments and predictive modeling,” it states. 
Slade’s company administers a national survey on cannabis use, which essentially measures and quantifies demand behavior for consumers. One of the things that they use it for, she said, at a national level is to try to understand how states are performing based on their policies. 
“And Missouri continuously outperforms other states, relative to their date of sale,” she told The Independent. “…because they were able to stand up a market so quickly.”
That was in part, she said, because Missouri limited the number of licenses to get operational within just a few months. For the study, Slade proposed to use the state’s track and trace data to identify the efficiencies of the licenses. 
“That’s a prime example of where we would uncover some extremely important considerations for policy,” she said. “And I do believe that the intent of the study is to identify areas of policy that need to be updated.”
Experts generally agree that Missouri’s decision to only issue the minimum licenses allowed under the constitution has been the key to the industry’s boom. However, critics have long argued that the decision created a monopoly that’s kept out opportunities for people who were most impacted by the War on Drugs. While the microbusiness license program was included in the 2022 constitutional amendment to address inequities, the limitations on what these businesses can do make it difficult to turn a profit. 
If the department does issue additional licenses, at least half of those licenses must be awarded to owners of cannabis microbusiness facilities that have been operational for at least a year.
The study will also provide information regarding the overall economic stability of the regulated market, including strengths and risks, with a special emphasis on the market’s impact on economically distressed areas of the state, according to the state’s press release.  
The Constitution requires the department to develop a plan to “promote and encourage ownership and employment in the marijuana industry by people from political subdivisions and districts that are economically distressed.” 
“The study will provide information,” the release states, “relevant to creating and implementing such a plan.”

Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) speaks during a community roundtable discussion on transgender issues at First Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Ann Arbor on June 30, 2025 | Photo by Anna Liz Nichols/Michigan AdvanceWhile the current political ecosystem has created a lot of fear and feelings of hopelessness in the transgender community, now is not the time to recoil or stay quiet, Michigan lawmakers and members of the LGBTQ+ community said during a community roundtable event in Ann Arbor Monday.
Lyra Opalikhin, 21, of Lansing said it’s important that lawmakers in Michigan take the time to look members of the transgender community in the eye and share what they’re doing to combat legislation and policies that threaten the community’s ability to exist in public life.
Opalikhin spoke after the roundtable event at First Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Ann Arbor.
In the first months of his administration, President Donald Trump issued executive orders mandating the federal government define “sex’ as solely “biologically male” and “biologically female”, banning service members who are transgender from the military, threatening federal funding for organizations that provide gender affirming care, as well as organizations that allow women and girls who are transgender on female sports teams.
Michigan has several bills that have been introduced this term that aim to ban gender affirming care for kids, not allow transgender students to use the bathrooms aligned with their identity at school and bar girls who are transgender from competing on girls sports teams.
Trump’s executive orders, and the ant-trans bills going through Michigan’s state legislature, are presented as issues of safety, to protect people, but that’s not their true goal, Opalikhin said.
“These policies are not being passed to protect individuals or to serve other individuals. They are being passed just to further restrict the trans community from public life and to restrict them from being able to live their lives to the extent that other people do,” Opalikhin said.

During the discussions with state lawmakers, Opalikhin said the inability for transgender individuals to exist in public spaces was a consistent one, where it’s clear that each policy limiting life for the transgender community is an attempt to erase the community.
But one of the best ways to rail against erasure is to provide the transgender community time and space to share their stories, Bree Taylor, founder of the Trans Unity Coalition said following the discussions.
“Let me talk about myself, let me talk about how I am transgender, but I’m also the other things. I am a self trained mechanic. I have a very loving boyfriend, and I have a dog and a cat,” Taylor said. “Let people talk to you about what being trans means. Let them talk about their story of who they are.”

Attacks on the transgender community have become a lightning rod issue, where some Democrats either remain silent or abandon their transgender constituents all together as defending transgender rights isn’t always popular, Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) said.
In March, eight Democrats in Michigan’s state House joined Republicans in supporting a resolution to implore the Michigan High School Athletic Association to comply with Trump’s executive order mandating a ban on male athletes from competing on female sports teams. The Democrats voting yes were Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), Peter Herzberg (D-Westland), Tullio Liberati (D-Allen Park), Denise Mentzer (D-Mount Clemens), Reggie Miller (D-Van Buren Township), Will Snyder (D-Muskegon), Angela Witwer (D-Delta Township) and Mai Xiong (D-Warren).

Michigan’s transgender community is under attack now more than ever, Morgan said at the roundtable event Monday, and as lawmakers, there’s a need to do a lot more listening to the community.
“They want to demoralize us. They want to tear us apart… and divide us, and we have to make sure that we do not let them divide us to the point that we aren’t fighting together for the causes of basic human dignity and human rights for the trans community and others,” Morgan said.
One of the topics for conversation Monday was how members of the transgender community can balance the value of telling their stories with the necessity for personal safety, and Rep. Morgan Foreman (D-Pittsfield Twp.) took a moment to acknowledge how helpless and scared some people in the room might be feeling.
Rest is important, love is important, Foreman said, and understanding that members of the community and allies might need to take breaks in the fight to protect transgender rights, serves as a reminder that people are stronger together.
“I think that is the most important thing to share right now, is hope, that there are people that are fighting, there are people who are working, there are people who are trying to make sure that the right things are done. So we don’t repeat history. I see the patterns are there, and it’s scary,” Foreman said. “There were so many times where people felt like the world was ending in the generations that are in this room. And the world did end, but it also changed. It transformed.”
In Michigan, where the state Senate is currently controlled by Democrats and Governor Gretchen Whitmer is a Democrat and vocal proponent for transgender rights, legislators can overlook the need to inform constituents of the legislative threats to transgender residents, Rep. Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti) said.
“We get so caught up in our Lansing bubble that we’re not always keeping the folks informed of what’s moving, what’s been introduced,” Wilson said. “And even though we have a lot of stop gaps in place to not pass bad legislation, folks still need to know what is being introduced and what is passing at least one chamber, just so they know what’s on the horizon and what could happen, not necessarily as a scare tactic, but we need to know where we need to be advocating and where we need to be fighting and why elections matter moving forward.”

Not talking about bills that pose threats to transgender residents because of the idea that they won’t pass and they don’t really matter, is counterintuitive to what it means to be an ally, Opalikhin said, and the idea that all Democrats will stand up for transgender rights has been proven wrong by some Democrats in Michigan’s Legislature.
It is a scary time right now for transgender Michiganders, Opalikhin said, but there is hope to be found in community and working across identities, with intersectionality, to uplift members of diverse groups of people in the state. 
“Trans people are suffering right now, but so are immigrants, so are Black individuals. There are so many different groups under attack right now, and it’s important for us to also be able to work together across identities and to try to solve these problems as a united front,” Opalikhin said. “If we are just splintered and fractured, focusing on our own individual issues without paying attention to other issues that are going on, it’s going to be harder to get things done.”

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)As many Alaska school districts grapple with steep budget deficits, and in the wake of Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s partial veto of an increase to per-student funding, the Alaska State Legislature has launched a joint bipartisan task force to focus on education funding.
The Legislature approved a $700 increase per student to the funding formula, but earlier this month the governor vetoed more than $50 million in education-related funding from the state’s budget, including a portion of the per-student increase, pushing it down to $500 per student.
Some lawmakers and education officials have expressed outrage and disappointment at the governor’s budget cuts, with leadership of both the House and Senate promising to hold a vote to override the budget veto to partially restore funding to schools, in the first five days of the January 2026 session. The Legislature previously overrode Dunleavy’s veto of a separate bill that enshrined the $700 increase as policy in state law; it required funding in the budget bill to put the increase into practice.
In the meantime, the task force, created by House Bill 57, will look at a wide range of financial challenges and school policies. It’s charged with making recommendations before the 35th Alaska State Legislature convenes in January 2027.
“This is a ‘yes, and’ moment,” said task force co-chair Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, in a phone interview.  “Is there a way by looking more globally at issues, that we can help contain some of those rising costs that districts have? But the fact remains that we haven’t given a significant increase to education in over 10 years.”

Education funding has been at the heart of Alaska’s ongoing political and financial debates among Dunleavy and the Legislature — as well as school officials, families and local municipalities — around state funding, policy changes, and how to improve students’ performance and learning outcomes. In a short video released the day of the line-item budget veto, Dunleavy cited declining state revenues and repeated his conviction that increasing education funding will not necessarily improve outcomes without policy changes. 
The joint task force is set to start work in August, Himschoot said, and will not only look at how the state funds school districts, but also how it can address rising costs of transportation, energy, health insurance and school maintenance. 
“We’re seeing double-digit increases in insurance costs, we’re seeing double-digit increases in energy costs. Is there something we can do to either arrest those increases, or a separate funding stream we should use?” she said.
“There’s been a lot of interest in trying to create some sort of an insurance pool to help with those costs,” she said, adding of the task force’s goals: “In general, examine the big picture to try to get down to that, so to speak, smaller picture of the annual funding cycle.”
Himschoot said solutions will vary as widely as Alaska’s 54 school districts, and the task force can take time on issues not afforded during the fast-paced legislative session. 
“We can tweak individual levers of funding during the session. We can look at how we’re funding career and technical education and say, ‘We want to fund it more. We want to fund it less. We want to use this other mechanism or this other fund source,’” she said. “So by doing this work during the interim over the next two years, it gives us time to ask questions, which often lead to more questions, and during the session, it can be very difficult, on a very tight timeline, and bring in all the different perspectives that need to be heard.”
The task force is planning to meet monthly and meetings will be open to the public, Himschoot said. “It’s super important that this is a process that anyone and everyone can participate in,” she said. “That’s the only way that it has any real value.”
Republican member Sen. Mike Cronk, a former teacher and representative for the large Interior District R that includes nine school districts, said he sees participation from school officials as mandatory. “I’ve already talked to numerous superintendents in my district, and I am going to require some of their input on certain things, because they’re the experts,” he said, in a phone interview. “I believe that’s the buy-in. I don’t believe ‘legislators’ singular, should be making these decisions. We need buy-in from everybody.”

Cronk said he wants the task force to create an ongoing, stable fiscal plan for funding schools. 
“We’re spinning our wheels. We just continue to not actually solve anything as a Legislature. We just prolong it to the next year, and the next year,” he said, after five years in the Legislature. “So that’s my desire, is to make sure that we have a fiscal plan in place where, if education needs more funding, we have the ability to get that. Or if roads need more attention, we have the ability to get more funding for that versus this. Just, ‘hey, oil prices are great, we could fund everything.’ Or ‘oil prices aren’t so good. Oh boy, we’re in a crisis situation.’ We shouldn’t be there. We should be working together, you know, for the betterment of Alaska.” 
Cronk said he understands the governor’s concerns but disagreed with his partial veto of the school funding increase. “I respect the governor: He’s a separate office than the Legislature, so he has the ability to make decisions what he feels best, you know, and I feel the more we respect that, the better off we’ll all be working together,” he said. “But again, the override vote of the initial bill, I think, was pretty strong and showed that for the most part, most of us supported the increase.”
The task force will also examine student performance and accountability measures, including absenteeism, as well as policy changes sought by the governor throughout the session, like open enrollment, easing the application process for charter schools, and reading incentive grants. 
Cronk said he’s open to looking at all policy changes to improve outcomes. “It’s not just straight up, how do we fund better? It’s, ‘How do we make our education system better for all students?’ So that’s what I hope to focus on,” he said. 
Task force member Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, said he’s interested in looking at the school funding formula. “So from some of the issues in the formula itself, like school size factor and district cost factor, which some of those haven’t been updated in decades, as well as some of the issues from the federal government, things like the disparity test,” he said, referring to the state failing a federal test and now proposing capping local municipalities’ contributions to their schools.

“A task force is well suited to come out with some recommendations,” he said. “I think that we also need to discuss accountability measures, so things like testing, how we test, how we talk about testing … open enrollment, how does that affect Alaska schools? How does it affect military bases? There’s a lot that we have to look at.”
Ruffridge said he’s also focused on teacher recruitment and retention, and incentives for local residents to become certified teachers. “So developing an apprenticeship track to be engaged with teachers, and really growing some of our teachers in their homes and in their communities, I think, is a really good idea,” he said. 
He and Cronk both said they hope the task force will be less of a political and more of an advisory body, “where … you take the time to understand these deeper, complex funding elements or other policy measures and bring forward a draft recommendation of ways that we could make things better — and then that would need to go through the political process,” Ruffridge said. “So, trying to be a little more apolitical.”
The task force also includes co-chair Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage; Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau; and Rep. Andi Story, D-Juneau.
Many school districts are facing millions in budget shortfalls, and with Dunleavy’s budget veto, school boards are going back into budget meetings this summer to make further cuts to programs and staff.
Himschoot addressed criticism of the Legislature not calling an emergency special session this summer to override the line-item veto, saying some legislators are out of the country and unavailable and there is more of a possibility of having the votes to override in January. 
“So the problem is, can we get everyone together? And if we do, will their votes hold? We know for sure we can get everyone together in January. We don’t know that we’ll have the votes, not now and not in January,” she said. “And so we are working on it.”
The task force will present recommendations in a report on the first day of the January 2027 session, the same month the task force sunsets.

Last week Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state budget deal with the caveat that the Legislature would also advance trailer bills intended to speed up housing development in California. The governor signed those measures Monday (more on that later), signaling a major change in the state’s 54-year-old environmental law. 
The California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA, requires government agencies to review and disclose the environmental impact of any public project, including new housing developments. The new changes to the landmark law would affect the state in two key ways:

Urban housing: For years pro-development advocates and the building industry argued that neighborhood groups and environmentalists wielded CEQA to delay or halt new development. Now, a large portion of urban “infill” housing developments — housing built in and around existing development — will no longer be subject to the law. That means developers won’t have to research or mitigate the ways new construction could impact local traffic, pollution, noise levels and other environmental factors. Though some housing experts say removing delays that would have previously existed under CEQA is significant, it’s too soon to guarantee that development in California will accelerate. Other factors, such as rising labor costs, tariffs and permitting processes can also slow down construction. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.


High-tech facilities: Critics of the CEQA changes are also slamming exemptions for high-tech manufacturing sites, which they say would make it easier for companies to build industrial projects in low-income communities already struggling with pollution. Democratic Sen. María Elena Durazo of Los Angeles, for example, cited the extensive cleanup efforts of lead-contaminated soil stemming from a battery recycling facility in Vernon. But Sen. Scott Wiener, a proponent of the CEQA changes, said the exemptions would help attract more companies, such as computer chip makers. Said the San Francisco Democrat: “These are jobs of the future … and I want them to be in California.” Read more from CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo and Rachel Becker.

CA budget deal wraps up

From CalMatters Capitol reporter Alexei Koseff:
Newsom, ‘Yes In My Backyard’ lawmakers and the carpenters union took a victory lap Monday evening as Newsom signed a pair of bills that will streamline environmental reviews for many housing and infrastructure projects in California. The governor demanded that the state’s entire $321 billion budget — which he signed on Friday — could not take effect without the proposals. 
They received his approval just hours before the start of the new fiscal year on July 1, at a signing conference where Newsom touted the changes as necessary to get California building again or risk losing the trust of the public: “We needed to go bold and big on this Holy Grail reform,” he said.
More budget news: As part of labor deal negotiations with some public employee unions this year, Newsom’s office is pausing state spending toward health care benefits these workers receive in retirement, reports CalMatters’ Adam Ashton.
With the price tag of $85 billion, retirement health care benefits serve as one of the state’s largest long-term debts. By pausing pre-funding payments for two years for current workers, the state would save more than $700 million in the new budget year, according to Newsom’s office.
Since workers in these unions also won’t have to contribute toward their retirement health care for that time period, the move would also boost their take home pay by as much as 4.5%.

Protecting and paying young athletes 🏈

Some changes could be on the way for California sports:

Youth football helmets: A year after Newsom vetoed a bill that would have banned kids younger than 12 from playing tackle football, the Legislature is considering a bill to prohibit youth tackle football leagues from banning “soft-shelled add-ons on football helmets” that are intended to prevent concussions. According to the bill’s author, Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, an Anaheim Democrat and former college football player, the proposal tries “to make the game as safe as possible, while also providing the opportunity for parents and young people to play this game if they so choose.” Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.


Paying college athletes: As part of a class-action lawsuit that takes effect today, California’s top universities can begin paying their athletes directly. Previously, student athletes were paid by third parties, such as a company, for their “name, image and likeness.” But in an unprecedented shift that further blurs the line between amateur and professional players, a school would be able to pay a total of $20.5 million this year to any or all of its athletes. Some student athletes at UC Berkeley, for example, could make more than $200,000 a year. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.

Don Bacon confirmed Monday he would not seek reelection in 2026. (Courtesy of Harding campaign) LINCOLN — Republican Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding jumped into Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District race Tuesday to be the GOP nominee. 
“I’m running for Congress to make America more like its heartland,” Harding said. “I want to take those good things we do in Omaha, like balancing the budget, [having] record low crime, [and] a strong economy and take that to Washington and be successful.”

He is the first Republican to announce a bid on the GOP side after U.S. Rep. Don Bacon confirmed Monday he would not seek reelection in 2026 — with more expected in the coming weeks. 
Harding has been a part of the Omaha City Council since 2017 after serving as chief of staff and director of economic development for former Omaha Mayor Hal Daub, highlighting city projects like the Dodge Expressway and Riverfront Parks. The councilman touted having cut the property tax levy three times.
Harding’s campaign set four pillars: Restore America, Grow America, Secure America and Renew America. His campaign says he wants to “stop reckless spending that fuels inflation and threatens Social Security & Medicare.” It also says he wants to “cut taxes for working families and small businesses,” “finish the wall and enforce immigration laws” and “reignite faith in the American Dream for the next generation.” 
He said he built his platform to broadly appeal to Republicans, Democrats and nonpartisans. 
“Who wouldn’t be for those good-paying jobs or growing the economy?” Harding asked. 
But Harding said his first focus is on winning the GOP primary and securing the nomination. Harding said he would probably be like Bacon in “many ways,” but they have differences of opinion on many issues, saying he persuaded a Democrat to back him for a leadership role on the council.
“I appeal to a broad spectrum and factions of the party,” Harding told the Examiner. “But at the same time, I don’t sell out my values to gain that support.”
His campaign rolled out a launch video Tuesday that nods to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogans, including making sure the next 250 years of America is a “new golden age.” The video also mentions the recent Los Angeles protests over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the city and the recent winner of the New York Democratic mayoral primary — self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani.
“What do we want  our next 250 years to look like?” Harding asked. “Do we want to be California or New York … or do we want to be more like America’s heartland?” 
Nebraska U.S Rep. Don Bacon announces he won’t run again in NE-02

Harding’s announcement touted high-profile endorsements from U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, a close friend of Bacon’s, former Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, a fellow former Daub staffer, and State Sen. Kathleen Kauth, a Millard-area conservative who might be in line to run for speaker of the Legislature. He also has the endorsement of Daub, who represented the 2nd District in the 1980s. 
Harding emphasized his long roots in NE-02, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and parts of suburban Sarpy County.
The district is the state’s most politically diverse and competitive — and could prove one of Congress’ most expensive races in the 2026 midterms. 
Other Republicans considering bids include former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei and former chairman of the Nebraska Federation of Young Republicans, Chris Chappelear. 
A group of Democrats is already jockeying for the nomination. Omaha political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and State Sen. John Cavanaugh have announced bids. Democrats Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis also are running. Another potential Democratic candidate, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, has said she is considering a House bid.
Harding expressed confidence in his ability to win the primary, partly because he has spent weeks assembling an experienced team that includes political and campaign veterans who have worked with Bacon and Fischer. 
“We will be the hardest working, the most organized, and we will win, not only the primary, but we will win the general election come next November,” Harding said.

Lawmakers left it out of the state budget they passed Monday.","In summary
California’s excise tax on legal weed is increasing, despite efforts to keep it lower to help the struggling industry. Lawmakers left it out of the state budget they passed Monday.


A substantial tax hike for California’s faltering legal cannabis market is set to take effect today, despite an aggressive industry campaign to suspend the increase that won the support of Gov. Gavin Newsom and other political leaders.
The excise tax for weed is 19% as of July 1, up from 15% — the result of a political deal three years ago that was intended to buy more time for the legal market to stabilize but which cannabis business operators now warn could chase away customers and push them over the edge.
“I’ve never experienced collective malaise like this,” said Genine Coleman, founder of the Origins Council, which represents small farmers in the historic Northern California growing region known as the Emerald Triangle. “People are so concerned with their survival and so deflated. It’s a dangerous space.”
An excise tax is a levy imposed on a good by the state before sales taxes are applied. While a push to freeze the cannabis excise tax through the state budget failed last month, a bill that would lower the rate back to 15% for the next six years is still moving through the Legislature. Newsom has pledged to sign a proposal halting the tax increase if it reaches his desk.
“I’m intimately familiar with the conversations around that and have great confidence that we’ll achieve our stated goals,” Newsom said during a press conference Monday.
Cannabis growers, dispensary owners and consumer advocates rallied for months at the state Capitol to avert the tax increase, which they argue could deal a fatal blow to businesses already operating with slim margins.
The price of weed has plummeted since voters legalized recreational cannabis through Proposition 64 in 2016, the result of a rush to overproduction even as most cities and counties in the state remain closed off to retail sales. Meanwhile, California is struggling to bring its market out of the shadows; the state Department of Cannabis Control estimates that legal sales still comprise less than 40% of weed consumption in California, which the industry attributes to state and local excise and sales taxes that can increase prices for consumers by a third.
Taxable cannabis sales in California dropped to $1.09 billion for the first quarter of 2025, down 30% from their peak in early 2021 and the lowest quarterly sales in five years.
Tax was intended to offset cannabis harms
It’s a crisis for the industry — communities that traditionally relied on cannabis production have collapsed economically — but also a problem for the state’s finances. Tax revenues from weed sales provide guaranteed funding for child care slots, environmental cleanup, substance abuse education and impaired driving prevention efforts as California faces a growing budget deficit.
“This was a poor time to say, ‘let’s starve the state even more,’” said Tom Wheeler, the executive director of the Humboldt County-based Environmental Protection Information Center, which joined a coalition of child care, environmental and tribal advocacy groups to lobby against a tax freeze.
He said it was important to uphold the promise of Proposition 64, which includes using cannabis tax revenue for programs that offset the harms caused by the cannabis industry, and expressed skepticism that the tax increase would hurt sales.
“I think the average consumer would not notice that,” Wheeler said. “At what point do we stop cutting taxes to benefit the industry?”
The 2022 agreement offered relief to growers by eliminating a cultivation tax, but it allowed state regulators, after a three-year pause, to raise the excise tax to make up for the lost revenue.
During budget negotiations last month, Newsom — who also wants to begin using cannabis tax revenue for enforcement against illegal cultivation — and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat from Salinas, supported extending the pause on the excise tax. They could not reach a compromise with Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Healdsburg Democrat who notably represents the Emerald Triangle.
In a statement, McGuire said “taxes on California’s overregulated cannabis industry have been a train wreck for years,” but he raised concerns about the fiscal implications of freezing the tax. State analysts estimate that increasing it to 19% could yield about $180 million per year for the state.
“It’s important to acknowledge that any freeze will create a budget shortfall which would impact critical community programs funded by cannabis tax dollars,” he said.
California could ‘forfeit a huge opportunity’
Industry representatives warn that further raising taxes will push price-sensitive customers back into the illicit market, hurting businesses teetering on the edge and actually lowering cannabis tax revenue in the long run.
“The math isn’t there,” said Amy O’Gorman Jenkins, executive director and lobbyist for the California Cannabis Operators Association. “We have no objections to how cannabis tax revenues are being spent. All we’re maintaining is that you can’t squeeze blood from a stone.”
They haven’t given up, though repealing the tax increase now that it’s taken effect will be even more challenging.
Assembly Bill 564, which would set the cannabis excise tax at 15% through the end of June 2031, passed the Assembly unanimously in May and now awaits consideration in the Senate.
Assemblymember Matt Haney, the San Francisco Democrat who introduced the measure, said he will keep fighting to get it to the governor. But he was furious that the Senate allowed the tax hike to take effect, which he said sent a message to legal cannabis operators that there is no incentive to follow the rules.  
“This tax could kill this industry and there’s still not enough being done,” he said. “California is going to forfeit what should have been a huge opportunity for our state.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pure-Beauty-Cannabis-MG-CM-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 08:59:54.286737

Some California youth football leagues ban Guardian Caps. Three former football players in the Legislature think parents and children should have the option of wearing them.


Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, a former tight end for San Jose State, had mixed feelings last year when he voted to support a short-lived proposal that would have banned tackle football for preteens. 
While he credited football for enriching his life, Valencia, a Democrat representing the Anaheim area, said he believes the game is too dangerous for young players’ developing brains. Gov. Gavin Newsom ended up taking the rare step of intervening in the Legislature to quickly spike the proposal. 
This year, Valencia has a new measure that he thinks could help protect young players’ heads, short of a ban on tackling. His Assembly Bill 708 aims to prevent youth football leagues from prohibiting players from wearing the mushroom-shaped padded helmet add-ons that are sometimes worn by concussion-wary NFL players during games.
In an interview with CalMatters, Valencia said the “evidence is substantially clear” that tackle football puts young players at risk of concussions and the long-term problems that come with repeated blows to the head. With the prospect of a ban on tackle football off the table while Newsom is in office, he thinks his measure allowing the equipment sold under the Guardian Cap brand is the next best thing.

“I think this is the direction that I feel most comfortable in, which is trying to make the game as safe as possible, while also providing the opportunity for parents and young people to play this game if they so choose,” Valencia said.
The bill is in response to some youth leagues forbidding the equipment’s use, citing concerns that the add-ons could negate helmet safety certifications. Helmet manufacturers and the organization that certifies them as safe for players reportedly have concerns the padding could alter how their equipment is designed to perform, making youth leagues vulnerable to lawsuits if players get hurt.
The National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment announced in November that attaching products to a certified helmet voids its safety certification unless the add-on has been tested and separately certified.
Two other former college players weigh in
Valencia has support from two other former college football players in the Assembly, Democratic Assemblymember Steve Bennett, a former linebacker and team captain at Brown University, and Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa, a former tight end and special teams player at Valencia’s college rival, Fresno State.
Bennett said helmet technology has improved dramatically from when he was a player in the ’60s and ’70s. When he was in high school, Bennett fractured his skull under his helmet while playing, he said.

Bennett supports the steps leagues are taking to make football safer, and he said he believes Valencia’s bill could help. He didn’t have a chance to vote on the proposed tackle football ban before Newsom killed it, but he said he would have had reservations about a ban.
“Some people say, ‘Hey, you know, we shouldn’t have a sport at all,’ etc.,” he said. “And I would just say that the benefits of the sport have for so many youth … outweighed those risks. So you have to try to minimize those risks.”
Tangipa disagreed with Valencia last year with his stance on the proposed ban. Tangipa hadn’t yet been elected to the Assembly, but he showed up at a rally urging lawmakers to kill it, he said.
But on Valencia’s bill, he agrees that parents and players should have the option of using the add-ons. He hopes the technology helps “bring back hard-hitting football again.” The NFL and other football leagues have changed their tackling rules to try to limit helmet-to-helmet collisions to reduce concussions. Some complain it’s made the game less exciting.

“Look, we went from leather helmets to hard-shell helmets,” he said. “There probably was, you know, grumbling that happened for that, and now we’re going to be adding an additional layer. I don’t think anybody should be bothered by that, especially if it protects our kids.”
There’s been no formal opposition to Valencia’s measure, which sailed through the Assembly and appears likely to do the same in the Senate. 
Medical groups support measure
The bill has support from the California Medical Association, the California Academy of Family Physicians, the California Neurological Society and the California Orthopaedic Association, which support taking steps to reduce concussions in young players.
But whether the helmet pads work as advertised is less clear.
The Guardian Cap manufacturer as well as the NFL say the caps have helped reduce concussions, matching lab studies showing the helmet pads reduce impacts. But other studies, including from Stanford and Wisconsin universities, found they had no effect on the rate of concussions or other head trauma.
Citing the lack of evidence, the Concussion Legacy Foundation reluctantly supported the measure but said it would prefer to see youth tackle football banned outright.
The group also noted “there is limited evidence that soft-shelled helmets have reduced the number of diagnosed concussions or will reduce the risk of football players developing CTE,” the acronym for the debilitating brain condition caused by repeated blows to the head.
“However, if the state is going to allow children to play, we agree that they should have the option to wear soft-shelled helmets,” their letter reads.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/092012-Pop-Warner-Football-REUTERS-CM-01-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 08:59:54.286737
,California,2025-07-01 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California colleges can now pay athletes directly. Why taxpayers may foot some of the bill,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/07/college-athletes-california/,"A watershed legal settlement takes effect today, allowing universities to pay college athletes directly.","In summary
A watershed legal settlement takes effect today, allowing universities to pay college athletes directly.


Starting today, California’s top universities can pay their athletes directly — a dramatic shift in college sports that blurs the line between amateur and professional play. Schools have yet to say how much individual students will actually make or when checks might arrive, though a CalMatters estimate suggests some student-athletes at UC Berkeley could make roughly $200,000 a year. 
In some ways, these payments are unprecedented. As part of a settlement to a class-action lawsuit, which goes into effect today, a school will be able to dole out up to a combined $20.5 million this year in payments to any or all of its athletes. Almost all of the money will go to football players and to a lesser extent, men’s basketball players. 
At public universities, such as UC Berkeley or UCLA, schools could use taxpayer dollars to make these payments. State or institutional funds already support roughly 30% of UC Berkeley’s athletic budget, according to one analysis by Syracuse University and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. 
Student athletes are already compensated, albeit indirectly. Many college athletes receive full scholarships. They’ve also been able to earn additional money since 2021, when the state passed a first-in-the-nation law allowing athletes to make brand deals or receive gifts. 
Up until now, those deals, known as “name, image and likeness” compensation, were only allowed if they came from a third party, such as a company or a group of private donors, and the payments had to be in exchange for services. CalMatters found that some top athletes have made nearly $300,000 in a single deal by posting company advertisements on social media, though most students, especially women, make very little. 
The settlement allows universities to pay students directly, and it comes with a number of restrictions on students’ compensation and colleges’ athletic programs. Students in top athletic programs will now need approval to receive compensation from brands or donor groups. Colleges will also be able to give out more athletic scholarships, but in exchange, schools are required to further limit the numbers of players on each team who are eligible for tuition aid.
UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford and the University of Southern California are required to participate in the settlement, since they’re defendants in the lawsuit. Other colleges and universities in California can opt in.
UC Berkeley currently has about 900 athletes but will eventually need to cut roughly 100 players to meet the requirements of the settlement, Chancellor Rich Lyons said in a statement on June 11. 
Using a mix of current revenue and new fundraising, he said the university hopes to pay $12 million to its football players, $3 million to men’s basketball players and $1 million to women’s basketball players. If UC Berkeley were to divide it evenly — which is unlikely — that means this year, each men’s basketball player would receive roughly $200,000, each football player would receive roughly $100,000 and each women’s basketball player would receive around $60,000. Lyons did not mention paying any other athletes, though they could still receive a scholarship and, if approved, certain brand deals or donations. 
UC Berkeley declined to respond to CalMatters’ questions seeking further clarification. Stanford has yet to comment publicly on the settlement and did not respond to CalMatters’ request for comment.
UCLA is not saying how much it will allocate to each of its athletic teams but Athletic Director Martin Jarmond has said that the school will distribute a total of $20.5 million, the maximum yearly amount allowed. USC said it will do the same, said Cody Worsham, the university’s senior associate athletic director. He said USC “will increase investment in all 23 (athletic) programs,” which could include additional scholarships as well as direct payments. 
‘The settlement doesn’t advance California athletes’ rights at all’
This new payment system may not last for long, as at least two groups have already filed legal challenges. 
In addition to allowing schools to pay students directly, the settlement also includes a provision requiring the National Collegiate Athletic Association to divide up roughly $2.8 billion and give it to former student athletes who never had the opportunity to get paid because of the previous NCAA rules. Most of that money, 75%, is supposed to go to former football players. Former basketball players are set to receive 15% of the total payout, women’s basketball players will receive 5% and the remaining 5% will go to all other athletes. 
Female athletes from across the country have appealed that payout plan, putting any payments on hold. The women claim that the settlement payouts violate the federal non-discrimination law, known as Title IX. 
“The settlement doesn’t advance California athletes’ rights at all,” said Ramogi Huma, the executive director of the NCAA, which advocates for the rights of college athletes. “It just stifles it.”
Huma sponsored the California bill that first allowed athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness in 2021. That bill expressly prohibits schools and athletic associations, such as the NCAA, from preventing compensation for college athletes, but “this settlement would do just that,” said Huma. Under the settlement, combined compensation to all athletes cannot exceed $20.5 million, and students may not be able to receive compensation from certain donor groups, known as booster clubs or collectives. 
By participating in the settlement, Huma said California’s colleges and universities may be violating state law. 
Where will the money to pay college athletes come from?
Often known as “revenue-sharing,” these new direct payments are no different from any other kind of expenditure. “Schools can use any dollars that they have to pay their athletes,” said Mit Winter, an attorney specializing in college athletics — it doesn’t matter whether the athletic programs earn any revenue at all. 
Some of the money for sports at California’s public universities comes from TV deals, ticket sales and parking fees, but some also comes from the college’s general fund, which is taxpayer-supported, and from fees that all students pay to their university. In some cases, such as at Fresno State, the portion of athletic revenue that comes from taxpayer dollars or student fees has increased over the past 15 years, according to analyses by the school’s student newspaper. 
“The school itself may say we’ll use this money over here, that comes from ticket sales or donations from donors, but the money is fungible,” said Daniel Rascher, a professor of sports finance at the University of San Francisco. Student-athletes could receive payments based on the revenue of ticket sales, for example, but the office staff who administer those payments may rely on general fund dollars for their salaries. 
While paying athletes directly may seem like a change for the university and the taxpayers who may foot the bill, Rascher said it isn’t really a new expenditure at all. “They were already spending this money on getting students to show up — expensive coaches, high quality training facilities.” 
He said athletic programs benefit all students by helping to market the university. “One way we know it’s a net positive is that schools are continuing to join the Division 1,” said Rascher. Division 1, which includes more than 350 schools across the country, is the most elite and costly arena for college sports. 
Colleges get three weeks to figure million-dollar payment system
Although universities will be allowed to distribute up to $20.5 million to its athletes, many won’t be able to dole out that much. At Cal State Bakersfield, Athletic Director Kyle Conder said the school will also participate in the settlement, though it doesn’t have “any revenue to share” at the moment.
UC San Diego joined the NCAA Division 1 last year and Associate Athletic Director Jeff Tourial said it already plans to join the settlement and pay its athletes. He said the school won’t be able to pay out the maximum and that the university is “still working out the specifics,” such as how much money it will spend or who it will go to.
“Everybody in our world is hesitant to commit to anything because there could still be appeals,” Tourial said. “There’s still so much uncertainty. It’s hard to pin down a number in a relatively short period of time.”
California District Judge Claudia Wilken finalized the settlement on June 6, giving schools just over three weeks to decide how they would officially respond. “There are many people in our department who are thinking about this all day, every day,” said Tourial. “The college athletics landscape is shifting very rapidly. Seemingly every day it’s something else.”
For Karson Gordon, an incoming sophomore at UCLA and a member of the football and track and field teams, today’s settlement is hardly on his mind.
Along with a full scholarship, Gordon also made over $20,000 over the last academic year by signing trading cards and through deals with a sunglasses company, a beverage company and various nonprofit organizations. Those deals will now be subject to approval under the new settlement. Gordon said he doesn’t know yet if he will be paid directly by UCLA or how much he will make, but he’s not concerned.
“It’ll all iron itself out,” he said. “I’m honestly blessed just to get compensation for myself and my athletic abilities.” His focus, he said, is on the field.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/112325_UCLA-Football_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 08:59:54.286737

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Over 50,000 people added Utah as their home address from 2023 to 2024, taking the state population to 3.5 million. Over 70% of them were along the Wasatch Front, composed of Salt Lake, Utah, Davis and Weber counties.
Housing units in those counties, the most populous in the state, also grew. But, the pace of those additions didn’t match peak numbers witnessed in 2022, according to a Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute report on Wasatch Front communities.
Municipalities along the Wasatch Front added 17,970 new housing units between 2023 and 2024. That’s down from a high of 28,068 in 2022, the Gardner Institute wrote after reviewing building permit data.

“The Wasatch Front added 36,730 new residents between 2023 and 2024, declining slightly from population growth of 42,348 between 2022 and 2023,” Eric Albers, lead author of the report, said in a statement. 
Between 2011 and 2024, the population growth along the Wasatch Front has ranged from a low of 30,208 people, which was measured between 2012 and 2013, and a high of 45,716, seen between 2016 and 2017, Albers added.
However, the institute doesn’t have housing unit increase estimates for Wasatch Front counties prior to 2020. 
“Over this period, housing unit growth peaked between 2021 and 2022 at 28,068,” Albers said, “and has fallen to 17,970 between 2023 and 2024.”
According to the study released Monday, Salt Lake City is for the third consecutive year leading the population growth, with 4,450 more people in 2024, the report authors wrote. The state capital also accounted for almost 54% of new housing, adding almost 3,700 units.

With these updated numbers the analysts determined that 1 in 5 new housing units are in Salt Lake City.
In the housing growth ranking, Saratoga Springs was in the top two with 1,026 more units, followed by Herriman, which added 1,017 units.
The fastest growing municipality in the area was Magna, which saw an 8% population increase in 2024. However, 8 of the 10 fastest-growing cities on the Wasatch Front were in Utah County, led by Saratoga Springs with 7.9% and Highland with 7.8%, the authors wrote. 
Despite most communities’ growth, there were still some other patterns in different cities on the Wasatch Front. Three of them didn’t add any residents during the 2023-2024 period and 29 lost population.
In Salt Lake County, four cities had population declines of more than 200 people — Sandy, which lost 710 residents, Taylorsville with a decline of 357, Midvale with 289 and Kearns with 207.
While there was growth in five cities in Davis County, 11 of them lost population as well, led by North Salt Lake with a 132-person decline. 
Six communities in Weber County saw growth of more than 100 residents. But, six municipalities also experienced modest population decreases, with Roy losing the most residents, 133 people.

But when it comes to noticeable change, supporters say: Be patient. 
Alabama schools for decades have gotten money based on headcount. SB 305, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, created the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) fund, which allocates additional funds to public schools based on weights. 
Schools will receive an additional 2.25% of their base funding for students in poverty; 2%, 10% and 75% for three tiers of students in special education; 7% for English language learners (ELL); 2% for charter school students; and 4.5% for gifted students. According to the law, if a school’s percentage of ELL students is greater than 9% of its average daily membership (ADM), the weight for those students increases to 10%.

“The money is supposed to follow the child, and by that I mean into their school,” Orr, the chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee, which oversees the Education Trust Fund budget, said in a recent interview.
According to a breakdown of funding created by the Alabama State Department of Education, Mobile County and Jefferson County schools will receive the most money from the RAISE Act in the 2026 fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1. Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS), which has 91 schools, will get $11.4 million. Jefferson County, which has 58 schools, will receive $8.7 million. 
Both systems will get the most money from the poverty weight of the RAISE Act, but Jefferson County will get the most in the state for ELL students. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 16.3% of Mobile County lives in poverty, and 16% of Jefferson County lives in poverty. Messages seeking comment from both systems were left last week and Tuesday.
Although Jefferson and Mobile counties have a large population of students living in poverty, 33.6% of Bullock County lives in poverty. The Bullock County School System in the Black Belt, which has four schools, will get $193,000 for students in poverty, 44% of its total additional funding.
 State Superintendent Eric Mackey said in an interview earlier this month that it could take at least ten years to see an improvement in test scores, and that systemic changes like the RAISE Act will not happen overnight.
“It’s going to take a long time to get the amount of money involved that would be needed to really show great student return,” Mackey said.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Mean Education Committee, carried the legislation in the House. He said in a recent interview that he would “expect something like five years to see the needle move in a positive direction in all these areas.”  
Although schools will get additional funding, there are accountability measures in place if the system does not improve. 
“If they don’t move the needle for that school, if the school’s not improving, if the test scores aren’t improving, with these additional dollars coming their way, then they will risk that money being reduced or outright forfeited,” Orr said. 
The fund will take years to reach capacity, according to Orr, and therefore see lasting changes. The Legislature appropriated $375 million for three years from the Education Opportunities Fund, a state savings account for budget surpluses intended for educational initiatives: $100 million for FY25, $125 million for FY27 and $150 million for FY28. An additional $58 million was appropriated from the Education Trust Fund (ETF) for FY26, according to Orr. 
“We’re gonna try to keep two or three years in advance in that fund,” Orr said. “So if the economy ever goes right down, we are not going to have to walk it back on our schools.”
Orr said that in order to see significant changes, the RAISE fund will have to include $8 to $9 billion over time.
“It’s going to take some years to get,” he said. “We’re not going to hold them accountable if we just gave them an extra million dollars, and say you’ve got to make a miracle here.”
Each school district has some discretion on where the money goes, but Mackey said schools can only move 10% before approval from the state superintendent is required.
“The legislature gave me the authority to do that, and I felt like 10% was a good break,” Mackey said at the State Board of Education’s June work session.
Orr said money movement has to be justified.
“If you’ve got a school, let’s say an elementary school with a high EL composition on one side of town, and the school district gets this extra money because of these EL students, but then they decide they want to go spend it on the high school on the other side of town for the football field,” Orr said. “That’s a no, no. You can’t do that.”
While the larger school systems are getting the most additional funding, smaller systems are getting funding that Orr said would be more impactful. DeKalb County Schools in northeastern Alabama is getting $1.4 million for ELL students, which is 45% of its total additional funding. The system has 12 schools, but 85% of its Crossville High School is Hispanic. A message seeking comment from the school system was left last week and Tuesday.
Albertville City Schools in northeastern Alabama, which has seven schools, is getting $1.6 million for ELL students, 61% of its total additional funding. Russellville City Schools in northwestern Alabama, which has five schools, is getting $701,000 for ELL students, 61% of its total additional funding. Cullman County Schools in central Alabama, which has 26 schools, is getting $834,000 for students in poverty, 45.5% of its total additional funding.
“It just takes a long time. We were one of six states that were not doing this,” Orr said. “And I’m glad we finally got going.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Danny-Garrett-Arthur-Orr-May-8-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

In 2024, Missouri was ranked 38th nationwide when it came to prevalence of mental illness and overall access to treatment. So the state made multimillion-dollar investments to improve responses when Missourians are in moments of crisis.
For decades, calling 911 or going to the emergency room was the norm if a person was experiencing a mental health crisis.
Now, with the rollout of a statewide network in tandem with the national crisis hotline, 988, Missouri’s behavioral health providers dispatch teams of social workers or other specialists to be there for someone experiencing a crisis, at no cost to them.
“Not everything requires a level 10 response,” said Jamie Manning, the vice president of access and urgent care services at Compass Health Network. “Outside of calling 911, there’s now this free, accessible service, and you don’t have to wait until it’s that bad. You don’t have to go to the hospital when you’re at your wits’ end. We can help you before it gets to that point.”
Missouri currently has 20 behavioral health centers in the mobile crisis response network statewide. If a person dials 988 in the midst of a crisis and they need more support than is available through a phone call, the providers in the network will send out a team of two behavioral health workers to help them through their crisis.
“For many, many years, there weren’t other options,” Manning said. “Thank goodness we have new resources so there’s now that in between.”
 How mobile crisis came online as part of Missouri’s mental health response

Many behavioral health providers, especially those serving rural patients, had some form of a mobile crisis response in place even before the state launched its network in tandem with 988.
As a caseworker early in her career, Manning remembers the toll that mobile response calls could have on staff. Workers were on call outside of their typical working hours, which meant more work and management for caseworkers outside of their day-to-day responsibilities.
But with the launch of 988 and an investment in the statewide mobile crisis network, behavioral health providers were able to hire full-time staff and create separate mobile teams whose purpose is to go out into the community and respond to the calls.
For fiscal years 2025 and 2026, Missouri set aside about $15 million annually that trickles down to behavioral health providers to staff and fund their mobile crisis teams. And the investment is changing the way the state responds to mental health crises.
“They are trained behavioral health professionals that will respond to a situation without law enforcement,” said KC Rafferty, the director of community engagement at the Missouri Behavioral Health Council.
The goal is to get to the root cause of someone’s crisis moment and get them connected to care that better fits their needs.
“If we’ve seen this person over and over and over again, how can we maybe think differently, think outside the box, to engage with them and ensure that they are getting the appropriate care for what they need?” Rafferty said.
In 2024, the 988 hotline in Missouri answered nearly 85,000 calls, 20,500 texts and nearly 8,800 chats. Of those contacts, about 3,000 — or just over 2.7% — resulted in a mobile crisis team being dispatched.
So far in 2025, 3.08% of contacts result in a mobile team heading out into the state, data provided by the Department of Mental Health shows.
Providers go to a patient’s home or meet them at a more public location, like a library or parking lot. After responding to a call and deescalating the situation, providers offer the opportunity to check back in with patients in the days following a crisis. They offer them options for short- or long-term care and treatment, or other assistance, such as helping them fill out Medicaid applications or making a doctor’s appointment.
But each case is different, and challenges remain when treating behavioral health conditions, especially in rural areas.
“Whenever we’re talking about rural mobile response, it’s the culture,” said Natasha Corkins, the director of crisis services for Burrell Behavioral Health’s southwest region, which covers Springfield and six surrounding counties. “There are people who call and want to speak, and we offer a mobile response and they’re hesitant because they don’t want to invite someone to their home or their location.”
“Consent is very important to us, because a crisis is a very individual and intimate situation,” Corkins said. “We don’t want to show up and possibly escalate a crisis by our presence. We want them to invite us in.”
Another challenge posed in rural communities is access to the internet when people are ready to seek out resources, Rafferty said.
“That can pose its own threat if they don’t have the ability to get where they need help, or to call someone to get assistance, if there is poor coverage in their area,” Rafferty said.
In all behavioral health responses, patience and understanding are key to better outcomes for patients, said Laurie Cox, the director of crisis services at Swope Health in Kansas City.
“If you keep getting in crisis, the only way to stop that is to get the services that you need,” Cox said. “But we also know that it is really hard for people to do. So it takes patience, it takes determination, it takes knowing how hard to push.”
 Shifting from 911 and emergency rooms to living rooms and libraries 

Emergency responders and behavioral health workers agree that an emergency room or a jail cell isn’t the best place for someone who is experiencing a crisis. But for many years, it was the only option.
Now, if it is safe, emergency medical services and law enforcement don’t need to be on-site at many of the 988 mobile dispatches, because there are mobile responders across the state trained in deescalation.
And they say the number of behavioral health calls they are needed for has dropped as the option becomes better known.
“If we go back and look at repeat patients, a lot of those have significantly decreased because they are getting the follow-up they need,” said Chris Bogguss, the director of EMS in Macon County. “They were given the appropriate resources.”
And for situations where emergency responders are needed at a behavioral crisis call, Missouri is incentivizing them to receive crisis intervention training in how to assess and deescalate crisis calls.
“It’s the education that we’ve received outside of our traditional EMS training that’s really helped us … better understand the patient’s needs,” Bogguss said.
Burrell Behavioral Health’s southwest coverage area has a crisis hotline specialist embedded in the Springfield-Greene County 911 dispatch center.
“We can work on diverting crisis callers from 911 to our crisis team, and hopefully stop the dispatching before it happens,” Corkins said.
Ultimately, providers want Missourians to know they can reach out for help and get connected to support or services through the 988 network.
“The goal is not to provide the Band-Aid in the moment, although that has its benefits,” Manning said. “How can we ensure that this has some lasting impact? It’s not a one and done. We’re here for you in whatever capacity you’re open to.”

Majority of New Mexico’s annual spending passes governor’s veto test


 



Not everything happens July 1
Laws without specified start dates take effect 90 days from the end of the Legislative session or June 20 this year.
Some laws passed in the 2025 Legislative session contain staggered start dates, including the medical psilocybin program, slated to start in 2027; along with requirements to put defibrillators into every school and reforms to the state’s wildlife agency, which both take effect in 2026.
Other bills with emergency clauses went into effect immediately after signing, including a provision to allow New Mexico graduates to wear tribal regalia and bills allowing local governments more ways to access money to aid in disaster recovery and emergency response.



Criminal Justice
Lawmakers spent the first 30 days of the 2025 legislative session focused on a package of criminal-legal reforms crammed into House Bill 8, including: overhauling criminal competency; enhanced penalties for fentanyl trafficking; increased fourth-degree felony charges for making a shooting threat; criminalization for possession of a weapon conversion device; increased penalties for vehicle thefts; and legislation to make it easier for police to conduct blood tests in DWI cases.
Tuesday also marks the first day for a new police agency under the state’s insurance regulator to enforce state cannabis laws.

Health care
Lawmakers will begin seeding the Medicaid trust fund with $300 million on Tuesday to generate enough in interest to pay more for low-income residents’ health care services. Lawmakers remain concerned that proposed federal cuts could further impact the state, which has the highest U.S. per-capita reliance on the program.
Education
Lawmakers increased minimum teacher salaries by an additional $5,000 dollars across the state, and ensured the inclusion of vocational teachers of subjects such as auto-shop, culinary and other trade skills. Lawmakers also raised minimum annual salaries for staff such as cafeteria workers and custodians, to $30,000 and enacted a 4% raise for all staff.
The state also raised oil and gas royalty rates for the first time in 50 years, which is expected to produce between $50 and $75 million to New Mexico’s public schools, universities and specialty schools.
Environment
While many of New Mexico’s big changes to water policy and pollution already went into effect, several changes to energy policy start July 1.
For instance, the state will allow larger electric utilities to incorporate advanced grid technology projects into their plans to modernize electric grids, and incorporate those plans into the ratemaking process before the Public Regulation Commission.
Child welfare
Child welfare presented a throughline of tension between the executive, and legislative branches this session. Members of the New Mexico Department of Justice will begin standing up the Office of the Child Advocate, tasked with independent oversight of the state’s child welfare agency.

The state also approved a minimum of $500 million in additional funding for the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
And just a few more:
Also going into effect Tuesday:

A $7 million state grant fund for animal shelter projects for communities.
A law allowing cyclists to pass through a red light at an intersection after stopping — without waiting for a green light —  or to proceed through an intersection past a stop sign with no cross-street traffic.




From years past:
Several laws passed in 2023 fully take effect Tuesday.
One allows the state to automatically register eligible voters during driver’s license purchases at the Motor Vehicle Division. Any change of address will be automatically updated with the Secretary of State’s Office. Another law reduces fees for administrative costs withheld from local governments by the New Mexico Department of Taxation and Revenue, which will be eliminated by fiscal year 2029. A third law in effect updates the license and certification requirements for elevator construction and repair.

,California,2025-07-01 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Newsom uses political stunts to garner attention. As Jerry Brown learned, it can backfire",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/newsom-stunts-political-career-backfire/,"Gavin Newsom has shifted his image-building efforts into higher gear, bolstering assumptions that he will run for president. But as Jerry Brown learned during his tenure as governor, past political stunts can haunt a presidential bid.","During his first governorship a half-century ago, Jerry Brown acquired a reputation for making abrupt changes of position, sometimes contradicting himself.
The starkest example occurred in 1978 when Proposition 13, a landmark tax limit measure, was on the ballot. Brown denounced the measure as a “ripoff” before the election, but soon after its overwhelming approval, declared himself a “born-again tax cutter” and sponsored a state income tax cut.
Brown’s chameleon-like tendencies drew much criticism, of course. But he rationalized them by citing what he called a “canoe theory” of politics.
“The way you have to approach the political process is something like piloting a canoe,” Brown once said. “If you stand up on one side you’ll fall in. If you stand up on the other side you’ll fall in. But if you paddle a little bit on the left side, then paddle a little bit on the right side, you keep going right down the middle.”
Despite his rationale, Brown’s frequent repositioning fed suspicions that he was less interested in governing California than in planning a presidential campaign. In fact, he ran for president twice during his eight-year governorship, basing his second bid in 1980 on cutting taxes and balancing the federal budget.
Ultimately, Brown’s evident lack of interest in his day job and his dipsy-doodles of positioning backfired. His 1982 run for the U.S. Senate failed miserably. When he returned to the governorship in 2011, having learned his lesson, he was a model of consistency and engaged governance.
That bit of political history is relevant to what Gavin Newsom is doing as his governorship winds down and he increasingly evinces hopes to succeed where his quasi-uncle — the Brown and Newsom families have been intertwined for decades — failed.
Ever since he won a second term in 2022, Newsom has been very obviously building a national image for himself with headline-grabbing political maneuvers and cultivating attention from national political media — all the while insisting that he had “sub-zero interest” in seeking the White House.
After Donald Trump trounced Kamala Harris last fall, Newsom shifted his image-building into higher gear, positioning himself as a leader of the resistance to Trump’s many changes of policy while, inexplicably, endorsing some Trumpian positions, most notably opposition to allowing transgender females to compete in girls’ sports.
The Trump administration’s sweeping roundups of undocumented immigrants in Southern California, including the use of National Guard troops and Marines — aimed, at last partially, at depicting California as a rogue sanctuary state — have given Newsom a new platform to claim the title of resister-in-chief.
Last week, he generated even more media attention by suing Fox news for defamation, claiming that Fox News anchor Jesse Watters edited out key information from a clip of Trump talking about calling Newsom about the immigration crackdown, then used the edited video to assert that Newsom had lied about them speaking.
The recent events have bolstered assumptions that Newsom is running for president. A few weeks ago, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.”
Political oddsmakers took it as a quasi-declaration of candidacy and early polling has put Newsom in the upper tier of potential 2028 Democratic candidates, albeit with scarcely double-digit support.
As Newsom’s time in office declines, we’ll likely see a steady escalation of statements and actions drawing national attention to himself, just as Jerry Brown did during his first governorship.
However, as Brown learned the hard way, if Newsom’s stunts become too blatant, he risks becoming a laughingstock who won’t be taken seriously.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/112124-Gavin-Fresno-City-Presser-LV_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

Horhn is the 54th mayor of Jackson. His inauguration marks a shift in leadership from a young progressive visionary to a seasoned moderate who promises to restore basic services, tackle blight and bring back economic development. 
Horhn, 70, will take the oath of office at 11 a.m. at the downtown Jackson Convention Complex following a prayer service led by eight religious leaders of different denominations. Council members, including the newly elected Kevin Parkinson of Ward 7 and Lashia Brown-Thomas of Ward 6, will also be sworn into office. 
The day concludes with a gala at 7 p.m. featuring performances from blues musicians Willie Clayton and Bobby Rush. 
A longtime state senator representing parts of northwest Jackson and southern Madison County, Horhn has pledged to reorganize a dysfunctional City Hall, create a comprehensive plan, and work with developers to bring more business to Jackson. 
The challenges are great: Jackson is the fastest shrinking capital city in the country, and many residents have lost faith in the city’s leadership to respond when they call with problems, much less fix systemic issues such as blight, economic divestment or Jackson’s relationship to the state government. 
But Horhn will have the support of a coalition of city leaders representing real estate, restaurants, unions, city contractors and nonprofits. With their support, Horhn rode to election, winning 3 to 1 in the Democratic primary runoff over outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and facing no serious opposition in the general election.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-01 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What’s next for birthright citizenship after the Supreme Court’s ruling,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/birthright-citizenship-after-the-supreme-courts-ruling/,The legal battle over Trump’s move to end birthright citizenship is far from over despite Republicans' win limiting nationwide injunctions.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The legal battle over President Donald Trump’s move to end birthright citizenship is far from over despite the Republican administration’s major victory Friday limiting nationwide injunctions.
Immigrant advocates are vowing to fight to ensure birthright citizenship remains the law as the Republican president tries to do away with more than a century of precedent.
The high court’s ruling sends cases challenging the president’s birthright citizenship executive order back to the lower courts. But the ultimate fate of the president’s policy remains uncertain.
Here’s what to know about birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court’s ruling and what happens next.
What does birthright citizenship mean?
Birthright citizenship makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally.
The practice goes back to soon after the Civil War, when Congress ratified the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, in part to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,” the amendment states.
Thirty years later, Wong Kim Ark, a man born in the U.S. to Chinese parents, was refused re-entry into the U.S. after traveling overseas. His suit led to the Supreme Court explicitly ruling that the amendment gives citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., no matter their parents’ legal status.
It has been seen since then as an intrinsic part of U.S. law, with only a handful of exceptions, such as for children born in the U.S. to foreign diplomats.
Trump has long said he wants to do away with birthright citizenship
Trump’s executive order, signed in January, seeks to deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are living in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. It’s part of the hardline immigration agenda of the president, who has called birthright citizenship a “magnet for illegal immigration.”
Trump and his supporters focus on one phrase in the amendment — “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” – saying it means the U.S. can deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally.
A series of federal judges have said that’s not true, and issued nationwide injunctions stopping his order from taking effect.
“I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,” U.S. District Judge John Coughenour said at a hearing earlier this year in his Seattle courtroom.
In Greenbelt, Maryland, a Washington suburb, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman wrote that “the Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected and no court in the country has ever endorsed” Trump’s interpretation of birthright citizenship.
Is Trump’s order constitutional? The justices didn’t say
The high court’s ruling was a major victory for the Trump administration in that it limited an individual judge’s authority in granting nationwide injunctions. The administration hailed the ruling as a monumental check on the powers of individual district court judges, whom Trump supporters have argued want to usurp the president’s authority with rulings blocking his priorities around immigration and other matters.
But the Supreme Court did not address the merits of Trump’s bid to enforce his birthright citizenship executive order.
“The Trump administration made a strategic decision, which I think quite clearly paid off, that they were going to challenge not the judges’ decisions on the merits, but on the scope of relief,” said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor.
Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters at the White House that the administration is “very confident” that the high court will ultimately side with the administration on the merits of the case.
Questions and uncertainty swirl around next steps
The justices kicked the cases challenging the birthright citizenship policy back down to the lower courts, where judges will have to decide how to tailor their orders to comply with the new ruling. The executive order remains blocked for at least 30 days, giving lower courts and the parties time to sort out the next steps.
The Supreme Court’s ruling leaves open the possibility that groups challenging the policy could still get nationwide relief through class-action lawsuits and seek certification as a nationwide class. Within hours after the ruling, two class-action suits had been filed in Maryland and New Hampshire seeking to block Trump’s order.
But obtaining nationwide relief through a class action is difficult as courts have put up hurdles to doing so over the years, said Suzette Malveaux, a Washington and Lee University law school professor.
“It’s not the case that a class action is a sort of easy, breezy way of getting around this problem of not having nationwide relief,” said Malveaux, who had urged the high court not to eliminate the nationwide injunctions.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned the court’s dissenting opinion, urged the lower courts to “act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court’s prompt review” in cases “challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order.”
Opponents of Trump’s order warned there would be a patchwork of polices across the states, leading to chaos and confusion without nationwide relief.
“Birthright citizenship has been settled constitutional law for more than a century,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a nonprofit that supports refugees and migrants. “By denying lower courts the ability to enforce that right uniformly, the Court has invited chaos, inequality, and fear.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25181747725853-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 15:09:12.202904

Akerman, the nation's first attorney general, made protection of Black voting rights his top priority.","JULY 1, 1870

Congress created the Department of Justice to handle the flood of post-Civil War litigation. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman, whose priority became the protection of Black voting rights from attacks by the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups. 
Congress aided that fight by passing additional laws that gave the department powerful tools to fight these violent white supremacist groups. These new laws enabled Akerman to obtain hundreds of convictions across the South. On one day in November 1871, 250 men in a South Carolina county confessed membership in the Klan. 
Historian William McFeely wrote of Akerman, “Perhaps no attorney general since his tenure … has been more vigorous in the prosecution of cases designed to protect the lives and rights of Black Americans.” 
But instead of rewarding Akerman, Grant dismissed him, and the battle to preserve these voting rights became less of a priority.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102347/July1-usaoseal.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:59:54.286737

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A state representative who led efforts to change Alabama’s ethics laws said last week he’s not sure if he will revive the effort in the 2026 legislative session.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, has sponsored legislation that made changes to sanctions for ethics law violations, increasing penalties in some areas and lowering them in others. His first attempt in 2024 stalled in the Alabama Senate on the final day.
“We will see what the appetite is for the body, if they want to take it up in 2026 or if they want to take it up in the beginning of 2027, at the beginning of a new quadrennium,” Simpson said in an interview. “You want to evaluate the bill itself on the merits and not the political aspect of, ‘How is this going to be played in the press for the vote.’”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After the bill died in 2024, the Legislature approved a Simpson-sponsored resolution to have the Legislative Services Agency hire a consultant to help research ethics laws throughout the country and provide a report on the findings. The report was finalized in February.
“A lot of good legislation stalled in this 2025 session,” Simpson said. “As we were looking at the calendar, as we were looking at the time, from the time we got the report from the attorney, then put something into writing that we could get into a bill format, starting to look at the calendar, it was ‘Hey, this may not have the timing to get through.’”
He added that, “If I trusted the press to give the right article, it would be great, but I have seen how that works. Until I get the correct messaging, and until we get the right buy in, it is going to be difficult to go through.”
HB 227, the bill Simpson introduced in 2024, would have enhanced penalties for some violations while reducing others. It would have made it a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison, for public officials to give anything of value to a public servant, either elected or employed. It would have also made it a Class B felony if a public servant solicits or accepts a bribe from themselves or another person.
That same violation is currently a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and only applies to the public servant regardless of relation to other people.
The legislation would also have separated the crime of bribery from those of economic gain, along with creating the crime of using a public officer for economic benefit, which is also a Class B felony if the value of benefit exceeds $10,000. If the value of the economic benefit is between $2,500 and $10,000, the punishment would be a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
It would be a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $6,000 fine if the economic value of the benefit was less than $2,500.
The legislation was modified to require the Alabama Attorney General’s Office to approve an attorney hired by the Alabama Ethics Commission and include the Alabama Secretary of State and the director of the Securities Commission to approve members to the ethics commission.
“I think our laws are vague,” said Simpson, who has served as chair of the House Ethics and Campaign Finance Committee since 2022. “There is a lot left up to interpretation and discretion of the prosecutor, and that is scary to me as a prosecutor. You don’t want to get into a role where some things can be interpreted in some way. You may have something interpreted one way in Jefferson County and another thing interpreted another way in Mobile County or Madison County. You want to make sure it is black and white so people are aware of what you can and can’t do.”
Critics, including the Alabama Attorney General’s Office and the Alabama Ethics Commission, argued the changes would weaken the state’s ethics laws and force the Alabama Ethics Commission to relinquish some of its authority and oversight powers for investigating violations by public officials.
“A lot of people opposed that bill, not just us, and it is because the changes that were suggested would have significantly weakened the (Alabama) Ethics Act,” said Thomas Albritton, director of the Alabama Ethics Commission.
Simpson convened a series of meetings in the summer and the fall of 2023 to review the state’s ethics laws in depth, provide greater context for the issue by having ethics experts offer testimony and allow the public to weigh in with their thoughts.
“What I wanted to do, starting in 2023, was let the public be aware of the discussions, let the media be aware of what the discussions were, get all the attorneys, all the legal minds, anybody that has any input on the application of the laws, talk to as many people as I possibly could, and do it in an open and transparent setting so that people could see what we were doing, why we were doing it, and be aware of the problems with the law.”
Delaney Marsco, director of ethics for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit and nonpartisan government watchdog organization, was critical of the bill.
“It would impact how the gift laws apply and make it such that the gift law doesn’t have any teeth and impact the disclosure requirement,” Marsco said in an interview last week. “It would change a lot of things in terms of the ethics laws, and it would weaken them.”
The Campaign Legal Center included the legislation as part of a report that provided a trend of how officials in some states are trying to reform ethics laws to weaken ethics commissions throughout the country.
HB 27 eventually stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee in the waning days of the 2024 session after it was unanimously approved in the House of Representatives with some House members voting to abstain.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Donna-Givens-Matt-Simpson-April-24-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

Assembly Bill 475, which was signed into law by Gov. Joe Lombardo last month, allocated $23 million for eviction diversion and rental assistance programs. Clark County will receive $15 million, the City of Reno will receive $5.2 million to cover the Washoe area, and the Rural Housing Authority will receive $750,000.
While the funding will aid existing programs helping to keep people housed, the demand for people needing help with unpaid rent “exceeds this allocation,” said Jamie Sorenson, the director of social services for Clark County.
Clark County, in conjunction with the Las Vegas Justice Court, launched an eviction diversion program in 2023. Reno launched a Housing Court, which includes an eviction diversion pilot program, last August to help tenants at risk of losing their housing.
“Housing Court cannot function without having rental assistance,” said Reno Judge Kendra Bertschy, adding that diversion programs “have to have that payment option” to provide assistance in order to be successful.
The court, she said, sees people who are often dealing with “economical challenges or medical emergencies or other unforeseen life circumstances that have led them towards this eviction.” Once they lose housing, they are likely to become homelessness and rely on other social services that “all costs taxpayers more money than if we had just provided them with some rental assistance and worked on keeping them stable.”
Eviction Lab, which is run out of Princeton University and collects data on eviction trends around the country, has consistently ranked the Las Vegas metropolitan area as having among the highest number of eviction filings in recent years.
Data showed the number of evictions filed in Las Vegas in April and May were higher than previous months this year, with 3,428 evictions filed in April and 3,779 filed in May.The number doesn’t indicate how many evictions were granted. 
Monthly eviction filings are 45% higher than they were prior to the pandemic, according to Eviction Lab’s analysis.
Reno-specific data is not provided by the organization. 
Nevada’s unique and complicated summary eviction law, which requires the tenant file with the court first after receiving a pay-or-quit notice, also makes the figures likely an undercount.
Lombardo’s vetoes once again thwart tenant-friendly housing reforms

Democratic lawmakers advanced several bills aimed at reforming the eviction system. Lombardo vetoed them all but approved legislation that allocated additional funds for eviction diversion.
Nevada’s pandemic-related eviction protections, which included legislation that temporarily paused an eviction while counties processed rental applications, ended in 2023. That same year, state lawmakers allocated $15 million to rental assistance with $12 million going to Clark County and $3 million to Reno.
The need for eviction assistance never went away.
“When I became a judge in Reno Justice Court in 2023, one of the things that we noticed was that there were a lot of filings for evictions for just non-payment of rent,” Bertschy said. 
Both Washoe and Clark counties had to adapt over the last few years with the number of people following behind on rent. 
The City of Reno at the time was handling applications for rental assistance for eligible tenants at risk of eviction. Bertschy said many landlords wanted to work with tenants as they worked to get assistance, but there was no guarantee how quickly the process would take. 
In order to streamline the process to ensure tenants would receive assistance prior to an eviction, a housing court was created to ensure those at risk of losing housing had applications expedited. 
A hearing date within housing court is scheduled 30 days after the landlord files a response with the court to allow for assistance to be processed.
During that period, tenants are given a case manager to help them determine if they are eligible for other resources like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
From August when the court launched through June, the has provided 105 households, or 265 people, rental assistance to stave off an eviction, according to city data.
Nearly a fourth of applicants were below 30% area median income with the remaining at or below 60% of area median income.
Data on eviction diversion in Clark County was unavailable at the time of publication. 
Most of the applicants coming through the program, Sorenson said, are likely people on the verge of homelessness.
“These are individuals who have been living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “The one time that they fall back on rent, that really spirals and leads them. If they face that eviction, it goes on their record, it makes it more difficult for them to regain other housing.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eviction-blurred.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

I went in at 18 on a relatively minor charge with an expected release in two years. Instead, I emerged at 62 years of age.
Over all those decades, I dreamed of freedom but when my moment finally came, the challenge to stay free was nothing I ever could have imagined. I was homeless for close to a year, shivering on park benches on frigid nights, not allowing myself to lay down for fear of attracting the attention of police. And when I finally came up on a waitlist for public housing, I was so happy, but I was denied based on my history. I sobbed when I read the letter, and figured it was hopeless.
I watched guys I’d known on the inside also trying to make it, usually giving in to selling drugs just so they could eat, with most getting caught and going back in. Society would say they hadn’t learned their lesson, but is that what’s really going on here?
In my case, through the grace of God, I came to the attention of some good people, who guided me, and supported me. I still have a long way to go, but I’ve been luckier than most.
Survival after prison shouldn’t be a matter of luck.
Most people come out with high hopes of making it on the outside, but the obstacles they face are almost insurmountable. When someone leaves prison, they are handed a bus ticket, a few dollars, and a near impossible task: rebuild a life with a felony stamped across their name. They’re told to “start over,” but society ensures they can’t. Employers shut doors, housing applications are denied, and even programs meant to help them reintegrate are overwhelmed, underfunded or non-existent.
For thousands of formerly incarcerated people, freedom is just another trap – one that pushes them back into the cycle of poverty and the crime we claim to abhor. If we truly want to reduce recidivism, we must confront the systemic discrimination that sabotages second chances.
Various programs offered inside prisons claim to “rehabilitate” but what value does it have if it all ends at the prison gates? Take the man who serves 10 years for a non-violent drug offense. Inside, he earns his GED, learns carpentry and vows to stay clean. Upon release, he applies to 20 jobs. One of them calls him back. But after a background check the answer is: “We don’t hire felons.” That man isn’t alone. 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals remain unemployed a year after release. Without income, housing or hope, many return to “survival crimes.” Is this failure theirs – or ours?
The stigma of a felony is a life sentence. Even in states with “Ban the Box” laws that prohibit initial questions about criminal backgrounds on job applications, employers will often reject the applicant post-background check. Licensing boards may deny people with records from trades like barbering or plumbing — skills that many learn in prison. Food stamps and housing vouchers are frequently withheld for those with drug convictions.  Meanwhile, reentry programs – job training, counseling, addiction support — are plagued by waitlists. In some cities, waiting periods for housing exceed six months, leaving many to sleep on the streets, an invitation to arrest if they are sleeping in a public space, which is all but inevitable if you are homeless.
When society denies people the tools to rebuild, recidivism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
According to Bureau of Justice statistics, nearly 44% of released prisoners are reincarcerated within their first year out. But this isn’t only about “personal failure.”  Studies show that stable employment reduces recidivism yet many employers refuse to hire the formerly incarcerated. They are often denied education — colleges frequently reject applicants with records. Even federal student aid packages carry restrictions for those with a record. Despite having paid their dues, for the formerly incarcerated, every door leading to admittance back into society is invariably slammed in their face. And then we act surprised when they struggle.
Change isn’t hypothetical. Nonprofits like The Last Mile — train, educate and connect the incarcerated with outside companies. The recidivism rate for those who go through their program is less than 5%. Countries like Norway, with their focus on rehabilitation, also have dramatically lower recidivism rates. 
Most of the formerly incarcerated people I’ve encountered want to be productive members of society. They just need help getting there. Here’s how we start:
1) Invest in reentry programs: fund job training, mental health services, and housing subsidies specifically for the formerly incarcerated.
2) Incentivize employers: offer tax breaks to companies that hire people with records.
3) Reform licensing laws and eliminate blanket bans on occupational licenses.
4) Expunge records: automatically clear old convictions after a crime-free period.
5) Humanize, don’t stigmatize: share stories of successful reentry to combat stereotypes.
Punishment shouldn’t last forever. Every person released from prison faces a choice: reintegrate or recidivate. By denying the formerly incarcerated the housing, jobs, and dignity they need to succeed, we make that choice for them. If we want safer communities, we must stop treating the formerly incarcerated as perpetual criminals — they served their time.

Vermont property taxes are high. Period.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mickey Nowak: Second-home owners are not getting any special treatment.","Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter about the commentary by Kate Hughes, “It is time to tax second-home owners more.”
Ms. Hughes states that legislators and Gov. Phil Scott should “make it a priority to tax second-home owners more.” Her reasoning is that the education portion of her tax bill is higher as a homestead property owner than a similarly valued house for a non-homestead property owner.
What she fails to mention is that, while it is true that in 74 towns in Vermont the non-homestead property owner pays a lower rate, in 186 towns the non-homestead property owner pays a higher rate. That is because of Vermont’s somewhat complicated formula for the education tax portion of one’s property tax bill.

Ms. Hughes also states that because of second-home owners it “means there’s a shrinking number of primary residents left to shoulder the cost of essential services.” The municipal tax portion of your property tax bill (that covers essential services) is set by the municipal legislative body and is levied against the municipal grand list at a rate needed to pay for municipal expenses. Both homestead and non homestead property owners pay the same rate.
It is also worth noting that non-homestead-property-buyers pay a significantly higher property transfer tax than homestead-buyers.
Vermont property taxes are high. Period. Second-home owners are not getting any special treatment.

Private schools are not the enemy of public education. It’s about meeting the needs of students.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brian Carroll: Making an argument for small private schools.","This commentary is by Brian Carroll of West Glover. He spent 26 years as a student services director for several districts in the Northeast Kingdom, and is currently semi-retired, providing consultation to school districts regarding special education and Title IX procedures. He also teaches English composition at Community College of Vermont.


If it hasn’t occurred already, it appears that H.454 will become law with the governor’s signature. It will be one of the most transformational education laws in decades with its focus on school governance, finance and the constitutional right to an equitable public education system.
The many iterations of the bill created significant division among educational stakeholders. Some think our educational system is inefficient and an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. Some believe the quality of instruction in our schools needs attention, thus more resources, particularly in the many rural districts in our state.
Then there is the division among those who believe independent schools should not receive public funding and those who believe it an inappropriate use of public funding. This particular issue appears to have the most divisiveness. Here’s my take on this issue.

READ MORE

Having spent the past 30 years of my career as a teacher and special ed administrator in Vermont and Virginia public schools. I’ve been an advocate of public education and believe in the teachings of the influential Vermont educator, John Dewey, who professed that public schools are necessary to sustain a democratic society.
I totally embraced the concept of public education’s requirement to be open to all learners, creating true diversity in the classrooms. As a special education advocate, I spent most of my career supporting the requirements of special ed law (IDEA, 1975) and believed that an IEP can make a difference to a special needs learner.
That being said, I now find myself in a position that may appear to counter these beliefs in public education. I have come to realize that students who learn differently don’t necessarily benefit from individualized instruction based on a special need (or disability).
I also realize that, given the many cultural challenges of the 21st century, our general student population appears to respond differently to larger secondary schools. By “differently,” I mean not achieving their potential due to the many factors involving technology, post-pandemic issues, and an increasingly divided society.
Several years ago, I was asked by a colleague to consider serving on the board of a very small, independent school. I had some reservations but I eventually realized that students do benefit from a small secondary school environment, so I agreed.
I have now served as chair of a micro-secondary school, East Burke School, for the past three years. With an enrollment of 7-12 students, it is truly a small school; however, it serves its students with a stellar, intentional and a tight curriculum that adheres to high standards, yet, can pace students along a reasonable achievement path towards a high school diploma.
This describes the type of opportunities that are sometimes challenging for some larger secondary schools in our public school systems, despite the many social, therapeutic and academic supports available.
Some vehemently oppose public funding for private, independent schools. I get it. One could easily argue that financial resources need to be totally directed toward our public schools. However, I would argue that private schools are not the enemy of public education. It’s about meeting the needs of students.
East Burke School happens to serve students in a district that has no secondary school. The students in this district have school choice. Ironically, the majority of secondary students split their attendance between two independent schools, both of which are considered relatively large by Vermont standards.
One could argue that school choice is a good thing for families of secondary students. Why is having a micro-school, as part of this choice, a problem?
There are those who argue that small schools are inefficient and costly due to low enrollment. On a spreadsheet, that argument may be valid, however, the tuition comparisons to the regional secondary schools do not support that argument.
I hope that schools like East Burke School will continue to thrive and can look toward a sustainable future without the current adversity and divisiveness that appears to be emanating from this law.

His life looks a bit different these days.

The former governor has been busy writing not one, but two books. He has signed up to be a professional public speaker next year. And he’s been taking lots of meetings in the man cave in the back of his barn.
“Civility is a big part of it. It’s just stressing practices and policies that work and maybe share some lessons of what didn’t work that I thought would’ve,” Holcomb said.
Six months after leaving state government, he has been sticking close to home. After all, he did a lot of international traveling during his tenure. Instead, he is getting used to life after being governor. Sometimes he doesn’t know the latest policy or political news unless friends and former administration folks send it to him.
Holcomb has already finished one book — a photographic review of his time as governor — which should come out later this year. But those pictures and remembrances sparked an idea for a second book on lessons learned. There isn’t an exact timetable on that book.
“It reminds you of big moments where you learned something, hopefully leading through it, but lessons that you learned,” he said.
COVID-19 will be a major subject as well as economic development deals and international partnerships.
Holcomb served as governor from early 2017 to early 2025. Before that he was lieutenant governor for less than a year. He cut his teeth in politics running then-Gov. Mitch Daniels’ campaigns and offices. He’s also a U.S. Navy man and ran the Indiana Republican Party for two years.
What’s next
Like some predecessors, he has formed a nonprofit 501(c)(4) called “A Better Way Policy Institute.”
“It’s kind of a carry on of my interest in how good policy can better communities, better lives, better economies. Leave it better than you found it,” Holcomb said. “And so, it’ll provide me an opportunity to work with other like-minded folks around the state, around the country, around the world.”
He said many people reach out to him and this provides him a vehicle to stay engaged.

Holcomb has only done a few speaking engagements since leaving office in January, including one recently with Daniels and former Governor and Vice President Mike Pence in Carmel. But he has signed an exclusive speaking deal with a company and written a few speeches. That will likely ramp up early next year.
In terms of policy areas, Holcomb wants to work more in energy, life sciences, defense, economic development and national security.
In the meantime, Holcomb is on the hunt for a tractor and handles mundane tasks like scheduling septic cleaning. Former First Lady Janet Holcomb has been impressed that her husband has been able to fully decompress.
“We rise with the sun daily … and we’re able to enjoy long days together and that’s very different,” he said. “I have a lot of time and duties to make up.”

(Photo courtesy of Alan Archambault)The U.S. Army is looking to shutter more than two dozen military museums, including Washington’s “gem” at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Pierce County. 
Lewis Army Museum is one of 29 facilities that the U.S. Army Center of Military History announced earlier this month will be closed or consolidated to direct more resources toward “readiness and lethality.”
“I’m really upset. I don’t think anybody is very keen on it,” said Tom Morgan, 88, a retired lieutenant colonel and vice president of the Friends of the Lewis Army Museum. “It is going to take a lot of political pressure to change this.”
Landing on the closure list was a surprise, said Megan Nishikawa, a volunteer who had a paid fellowship with Friends of the Lewis Army Museum.
“We didn’t think our museum would be on the chopping block,” she said. “Our museum is very special. It tells the story of Washington Army units and Washington soldiers. The things we have are treasures.”
As museum supporters spread word of the possible closure, the chair of a state legislative panel raised the issue Monday with the head of Joint Base Lewis-McChord.
“We have a gem in the Lewis Museum. It’s been around for 50 years, serving the public nobly and I’m concerned about the closure,” said state Rep. Mari Leavitt, D-University Place, in a meeting of the Joint Committee on Veterans’ and Military Affairs. 
Col. Kent Park, the outgoing Joint Base Lewis-McChord garrison commander, said he learned of the closure plan from news stories. “Unfortunately, we were not necessarily consulted,” he told members of the bipartisan and bicameral committee.
From what he’s since learned, it appears the Lewis Army Museum won’t be affected before 2027.
“One key thing that we are trying to communicate back is that the Lewis Museum is not just a museum, it’s actually a training facility. We have soldiers training in that building. So one way or the other, we do see that building staying open,” he said.
Because of that, conversations are starting on the possibility of partnering with another local museum or volunteers to keep it going, he said.

“Of course, that would require the exhibits and everything else to stay. We do not know if they intend to move any of those exhibits and other things that are there out of the museum,” he said. “We are pushing really hard to obviously leave that here. That’s the direction that we’re trying to push right now.”
A historic place
The building housing the Lewis Army Museum was originally built during World War I by the Salvation Army as a guest house, known as the Red Shield Inn, to accommodate soldiers and their families.
It was “sold” to the Army in 1921 for $1 and continued to be used as such until 1973, when it became the museum. In 1979, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Outside the building, visitors can wander through the vehicle park where one will find a Stryker combat vehicle, Army tanks, missiles and more. Inside are displays of uniforms, weapons, military art and memorabilia associated with the U.S. Army.
In addition, the museum’s archives have documents, diaries, maps and other items related to the installation and the soldiers who trained there. A number of the items actually belonged to local veterans, and were donated in honor of their service, said Alan Archambault, who served as museum director from 1987 to 2007.
“Army Museums are the institutional memory of the Army as well as the installations and units they represent,” he said. “If the museum is closed, so much of value will be lost to posterity.”
Archambault acknowledged in an email that the primary mission of the Army is not to run museums.
“However, museums provide a very important service to the Army, providing training to today’s soldiers, honoring our veterans, and providing information to the American public about ‘their Army’,” he wrote. “I view the closure as an insult and breach of public trust to all those people who have donated memorabilia, money and volunteer hours to the museum.”
The plan
The Army Museum Enterprise will shrink from 41 museums at 29 locations to 12 field museums and four training support facilities at 12 locations, according to the Army’s June 4 announcement.
It is not due to the Department of Government Efficiency. Stars and Stripes reported that the move has been in the works for a while and the announcement said a “substantial maintenance backlog and insufficient staffing prevent our museums from reaching their fullest potential as educational and historical resources.”
“The consolidation plan ensures the widest possible access to the highest quality museums within available Army resources,” it reads.
If a museum closes, its collections, artifacts and equipment could be transferred to another museum or into storage at the museum support center at Anniston Army Depot in Alabama, which can house vehicles and aircraft, or at Fort Belvoir, in Virginia, which stores smaller items.
A closure list obtained by Task and Purpose, which reports on military-related issues, shows that in addition to the Lewis Army Museum, other museums targeted for closure include those at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Camp Humphreys in South Korea and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment Museum in Vilseck, Germany.
Archambault said the senior chain of command had suggested at least twice before closing Army museums or contracting them out. He noted the Army would face costs for inventorying, shipping and storing collections from the facilities if they are shuttered.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/army-museum-jblm-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-07-01 08:04:38.177986

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
 Sell-off proposal

The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
 States’ role

While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.

“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
 Other proposals

While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

The hike is expected to allow NJ Transit to collect nearly $1 billion in farebox revenue, and it comes after last year’s double-digit fare increase. Critics have called the back-to-back fare hikes unfair to NJ Transit riders.
“Fares are best increased in small increments over long periods of time. So to have a 15% and then a 3% right after that is too much, especially when wages are not increasing at the same rates,” Alex Ambrose, policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, told the New Jersey Monitor.
NJ Transit spokesman Jim Smith in a statement defended the fare hikes, saying smaller, predictable increases allow the agency to better keep pace with annual cost increases.
“This allows us to continue to operate full service while making necessary improvements to the customer experience and maintaining the ability to respond to evolving needs,” Smith said.
Smith noted that in the last two years, multiple private bus companies abandoned dozens of routes with little notice that NJ Transit was able to absorb.
NJ Transit has faced fiscal challenges in recent years, with state lawmakers last year approving a new business surtax aimed at generating revenue for the agency. This year’s 3% fare hike was approved last year as part of a plan to increase fares annually.
Critics have said even with that revenue stream, the state has not funded NJ Transit at adequate levels, leading to worse service that discourages riders from using it.
“Lawmakers have not prioritized transit and have left it underfunded, which has led to fewer people taking it, which has led to less fare revenue, etcetera, etcetera,” Ambrose said.
Talia Crawford with advocacy group Tri-State Transportation Campaign told the New Jersey Monitor that the state needs a new funding source for transportation.
“Working-class families who are dependent on New Jersey Transit can’t afford a 3% increase every single year,” Crawford said. “It’s a lot of money, especially with rising costs of living, including my child care, housing, health care — everything is increasing.”
NJ Transit has proposed a $3.2 billion operating budget for the fiscal year that begins Tuesday.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida lawmakers spent much of the 2025 legislative session at odds with each other, causing several education bills to be delayed until the last scheduled day of session and jammed into two major packages. 
These resulting laws are set to go into effect on Tuesday, July 1:
SB 1070: Electrocardiograms for student athletes
The bill unanimously passed both chambers following emotional committee testimony from parents of children who died from heart conditions. 
SB 1070 requires student athletes to complete an electrocardiogram, a screening used to detect heart conditions. Students with abnormal results would need clearance from a medical practitioner to participate in sports. Under the law, electrocardiograms are not mandated if schools cannot offer them to families for less than $50 per student, and districts are encouraged to seek out partnerships to provide the services for families that can’t afford them. The bill does not begin the requirement until the 2026-2027 school year, but implementation starts this summer.
Martha Lopez-Anderson lost her son when he was 10 years old to a heart condition.
“Like so many parents, I had no idea that an undetected heart condition could silently take a child’s life with no warning,” Lopez-Anderson, director of Parent Heart Watch, said, calling the bill a “bold step in shifting from reaction to prevention.”
Hearings for the bill were heavily attended by parents whose children died from heart conditions. House staff passed around tissues to the audience during their testimony, for example, in the House Education & Employment committee.
Maruchi Mendez, mother of Ramiro Mendez, a Florida International University baseball pitcher who died from cardiomyopathy in 2000, shared her story with committee members.
“What is the price of a student athlete’s life?” Mendez said. “This month, here in the walls of the Capitol of our beautiful state of Florida and from all of your hearts, we shall know the answer.”
HB 1607: CPR 
This builds on existing graduation requirements, requiring schools to provide CPR and first aid training in middle school and high school. By July 1, 2027, all public schools must have one automated external defibrillator (AED) on their grounds. The bill requires schools to develop emergency staff training for cardiac arrest. 
Schools are already mandated to teach CPR in grades 9 and 11 and encouraged to do so in middle school. Schools that participate in Florida High School Athletic Association sports are already required to have an AED.
SB 1514: Anaphylaxis
The bill requires “an adequate number” of charter and traditional public school personnel to be trained to respond to allergic reactions, including administering epinephrine, a medication that treats allergic reactions. 
SB 1470: School safety
SB 1470 changes previous school safety legislation that Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd called “clunky and difficult to understand and easy to violate it even without the intent to violate it.” The bill creates exceptions for classes like welding that need ample ventilation from door-locking laws and allows temporary locks, among other things.
SB 248: School sports
This bill allows home school students to participate in sports at any public school in the district they live in and allows private school students to play sports at public schools if their school does not offer the sport.
SB 296: School start times
The bill essentially rescinds 2023 legislative action. The 2025 Legislature chose to not require districts to conform to previously enacted law that is set to go into effect in 2026 that would make schools start their days later. Districts pushed back against the old law, saying it would be too costly to implement. Now, if schools submit reasoning for not being able to start later, they do not have to comply.
SB 1374: Employee reporting 
School boards may temporarily remove personnel from the classroom within 24 hours after learning that an employee has been arrested on a felony or misdemeanor charge. It requires school employees and administrators to self-report within 48 hours any felony or misdemeanor arrest.
SB 356: Holocaust Remembrance
SB 356 requires the governor to declare Jan. 27 of each year as Holocaust Remembrance Day. Schools may observe the day by teaching students about the effects of the Holocaust and positive contributions by the Jewish community. The state has required instruction on the Holocaust since 1994.
HB 447: Disability History and Awareness
Florida law already designates the first two weeks of October as Disability History and Awareness Weeks, when schools may teach about the history of disability and the disability rights movement.
If schools teach disability history and awareness, they are now required to teach about bullying and physical disabilities from grades K-3, autism spectrum disorder from 4-6, hearing impairments from 7-9, and learning and intellectual disabilities from 10-12 under this law. Schools are not required to provide instruction on disability awareness, however.
The bill is named the Evin B. Hartsell Act, after a Floridian diagnosed with muscular dystrophy who died in 2018. The Department of Education may consult with the Evin B. Hartsell Foundation to develop learning materials.
HB 549 and 575: Gulf of America
These two bills address a change made through an executive order from President Donald Trump. They require state agencies and schools to buy new materials saying “Gulf of America” instead of “Gulf of Mexico.” HB 575 changes all statutes with references to the “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.”
HB 809: Social workers
The bill exempts school social workers from general knowledge mastery otherwise required in educator certification. The exemption, according to the bill analysis, is justified because social workers already are required to hold master’s degrees.
HB 85: Walking conditions
The bill expands the criteria for what constitutes a hazardous condition for students walking to school, creating more transportation options for those who otherwise would be walking next to busy roadways. 
HB 1145: Workforce development
The bill provides charter schools with Workforce Development Capitalization Incentive Grant Program money. The money is used to create or expand programs that lead to industry certifications by buying equipment, hiring personnel, and more. It has an indeterminate fiscal impact, according to the bill analysis.

As previously covered by the Phoenix, the waning days of the scheduled session produced two larger education packages with several components each:
HB 1255
The 83-page bill includes provisions addressing opioid antagonist administration at school, requires high schoolers to learn about the cost of college before they graduate, and renames Hillsborough Community College as Hillsborough College.
The bill requires parents to approve school administration of corporal punishment of their children.
Some lawmakers said they were not aware corporal punishment still existed in Florida, but, during the 2023-2024 school year, 17 school districts reported 516 instances of corporal punishment, according to Department of Education data. Principals are responsible for developing corporal punishment policy and state law requires that more than one adult be present when corporal punishment is being inflicted. 
HB 1105
The bill, among other things, implements a high school bell-to-bell phone ban pilot study in six counties and outright bans phone use for elementary and middle school students during the school day statewide. It allows law enforcement to arrest someone for trespassing on a school bus. 
HB 1105 eliminates certificates of completion, which had been granted for students who earn the credits to graduate but too low a grade point average or failure in required math and reading assessments. Lawmakers approved removing the certificate, saying it provided no real benefit in securing a student a job and repeal might incentivize some students to achieve a high school diploma, instead.
Students with autism could have a better chance of securing employment under this bill, which creates a workforce credential for students with autism to prove to employers they are proficient in certain skills, particularly workplace safety. 
This bill allows students who participate in two years of marching band to count that toward the one-credit physical education requirement. Existing law allows two full seasons of varsity or junior varsity sports to count toward the physical education requirement.
In the final packages were provisions lowering the threshold needed to turn a low-performing traditional public school into a “job-engine” charter school — one meant to attract jobs to a community — and another that includes charter schools as recipients of local government infrastructure surtaxes.
Existing law requires more than 50% of teachers and parents both to vote to convert a traditional public school into a job-engine charter school. The Legislature voted, over Democrats’ protests, to eliminate the need teacher approval and rely on parent approval instead.

At Easterseals Midwest, we support people with disabilities to live independently, find meaningful employment, get support in their everyday lives, and more.
The families we support are doing everything right—showing up for work, caring for loved ones, and making sure their children get the support they need. For many of them, Medicaid is the foundation that makes it all possible.
That foundation is now under threat.
Last week, Senate Republicans introduced a reconciliation bill that proposes deep and dangerous cuts to Medicaid –  a vital lifeline for Missourians with disabilities and the people who take care of them. Rather than improving on the already harmful House version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the Senate proposal goes even further, jeopardizing services that help people live independently and access critical care.
If passed, this legislation would devastate Missouri’s ability to deliver home and community-based services. It would increase waitlists, reduce access to care, and leave thousands of individuals and families without the support they need. Any federal funding cut would force Missouri to reduce its Medicaid investment, placing even more strain on an already overburdened system.
At Easterseals, we support more than 20,000 people and families across the Midwest every year. We see the power of consistent care and know how fragile the progress becomes when families face bureaucratic red tape and unaffordable costs.
Let’s be clear: Medicaid is essential. It supports more than just people with disabilities. It is a lifeline for parents, caregivers, therapists, educators, and direct care workers. In rural areas and regions with limited healthcare options, Medicaid is often the only access point for critical services. When it becomes harder to access, the consequences ripple across entire communities.
The proposed federal changes would cut off care for millions. It’s projected that 576,000 children and 110,000 people with disabilities could lose coverage. That doesn’t include caregivers, undiagnosed individuals, and others who depend on the system. And while some lawmakers argue for “work requirements,” the reality is most Medicaid recipients who can work already do. These proposals add red tape that causes people to lose care. Ironically, the Medicaid work requirement could cost the economy up to 449,000 jobs.
Beyond individual lives, Medicaid supports the broader health and stability of our communities. It helps prevent costly emergency room visits, reduces hospitalizations, and supports a vital workforce of healthcare professionals and caregivers.
Missouri’s senators Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt now face a critical decision that will directly affect the health, safety, and dignity of people with disabilities and the strength of Missouri families.
Instead of making Medicaid harder to access, Congress should invest in the systems that keep families healthy, employed, and hopeful.
Medicaid is one of the most effective tools we have to strengthen families and communities. It helps children grow and learn, allows caregivers to stay employed, and gives older adults and people with disabilities the chance to live independently. Weakening that system threatens the progress we’ve made toward opportunity for all.
Missouri deserves better. Our families deserve better. Senators Hawley and Schmitt must vote NO on any legislation that cuts Medicaid.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-07-01 07:00:42.685367

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states, including Michigan, are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm. 
The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government’s use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews.
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads. 
In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration’s position.
“In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America’s energy industry stifled by Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said.
While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing.

The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint. 
To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects. 
In Michigan, Tribal Nations and environmental activists have spoken out as the Corps moves forward with emergency processing procedures for Enbridge’s Line 5 tunnel project, which would replace dual oil and natural gas pipelines running through the lakebed where Lake Michigan and Huron meet, with a new segment housed inside a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock. 
While the tunnel project came as part of any agreement with the state to minimize the risk of an oil spill, opponents of the project argue construction would harm nearby wetlands, while still carrying risk for an oil spill. 
The project’s public comment window came to an end on Monday.

(Getty Images)Six of Indiana’s public colleges and universities are cutting or consolidating more than 400 academic degree programs ahead of a new state law that takes effect this week, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (CHE) announced Monday.
Officials said the “voluntary” changes target degree programs with low student participation. The cuts are intended to help students focus on more in-demand fields and to comply early with the new state budget, which now sets minimum enrollment and completion thresholds for all degree programs offered at public institutions.
Nearly one in five degree programs will be eliminated, suspended or merged across six institutions: Ball State University, Indiana State University, Indiana University, Ivy Tech Community College, Purdue University and the University of Southern Indiana.
Currently, the schools collectively offer about 3,400 academic programs, according to CHE. Of those, roughly 2,200 are degree programs at the associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral level. As of Monday, 408 degree programs are on the chopping block.
Story continues below.

Gov. Mike Braun praised the move as a way to modernize Indiana’s higher education system.
“In just the past month, our state institutions have taken bold, proactive steps to increase the value of higher education for both students and families,” Braun said in a Monday afternoon statement. “This will help students make more informed decisions about the degree they want to pursue and ensure there is a direct connection between the skills students are gaining through higher education and the skills they need most.”
Examples of impacted programs include:


Indiana University Bloomington: Several undergraduate and graduate degrees in foreign languages — such as French, German, and Russian — will be suspended or consolidated.


Purdue University West Lafayette: Low-enrollment master’s and Ph.D. programs in areas like literature, microbiology and mathematics were merged or will phase out.


Ball State University: Suspended programs include an English Ph.D. program and bachelor’s in international business. exercise psychology. Multiple undergraduate education programs are also on track for consolidation.


Indiana State University: Eliminated programs include the M.A. in history and M.S. in political science.


Ivy Tech: Impacted programs include associate degrees in public safety, nanotechnology and machine repair.


University of Southern Indiana: Among the affected programs were an associate’s degree in early childhood education, the M.A. in liberal studies and an undergraduate electronic business degree.


Programs were evaluated based on enrollment and completion data. According to CHE’s latest degree reduction report, 75 programs were eliminated outright, including 68 with zero students currently enrolled. Another 101 were suspended, and 232 were consolidated or merged into other academic offerings.
The bulk of the cuts were reported at Indiana University, where 249 degree programs will be affected. Purdue University followed with 83 programs. Ball State submitted 51 programs, and Indiana State reported 11. Ivy Tech, the state’s two-year community college system, is taking action on 10 programs. The University of Southern Indiana reported four.
Students currently enrolled in any of the eliminated or suspended programs will be allowed to finish their degrees through a teach-out process, officials said.
After July 1, colleges must seek commission approval to continue offering underperforming programs that fall below statutory benchmarks.

Bob Ferguson, center, met with several statewide elected officials in June to discuss how federal funding cuts under discussion in Congress and by the Trump administration could impact the state. (Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

Traditionally, most new laws passed by the Idaho Legislature would have taken effect on July 1, when the new fiscal year kicks in. However, over the past five years, legislators have increasingly been attaching so-called “emergency clauses” to bills that make them take effect as soon as they are signed into law by the governor.
Now there are a mix of laws that take effect when they are signed into law in the spring and laws that take effect July 1.
 State of Idaho prepares for new budget year to begin as revenue lags behind projections

State officials will closely monitor the process for closing the books on the current fiscal year 2025 budget. As of May, state revenue was running $141 million below the revenue projection Idaho legislators built into the budget. The state was still projected to end fiscal year 2025 with a positive ending cash balance, but that projected ending balance has shrunk from $420 million to an estimated $278 million since the 2025 legislative session adjourned April 4, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Although state officials say Idaho’s economy is healthy, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s budget office asked state agencies to internally prepare for potential midyear budget holdbacks of up to 6%, Idaho Education News reported. 
Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said that even though revenue came in below forecast, Idaho is still seeing year-over-year growth in revenue, which signals a healthy economy.
“Idaho also has 22% of general fund revenues in rainy day funds, greater than almost every other state,” Wolff said in a written statement June 12. “While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”
After year-end budget transfers and reconciliation procedures are complete, state officials should have a better understanding of the final fiscal year 2025 budget numbers later in July or in August. 
 



 Here’s a look at five new laws taking effect this week in Idaho

House Bill 7: This bill creates a new mandatory minimum fine of $300 for adults convicted of possessing less than three ounces of marijuana. Republican legislators who supported the law said it is a way to be tough on marijuana and distinguish Idaho from neighboring states like Washington, Montana, Oregon and Nevada where recreational cannabis is legal. 
House Bill 322: This bill increases the salaries for judges in Idaho. Before the 2025 legislative session, Idaho Supreme Court justices encouraged the Idaho Legislature to raise pay for judges, saying that pay for Idaho judges was among the lowest in the nation and pay was so low that many judges who announced their retirement returned to practice law as attorneys, where they could make more money. The new law raises the pay for each judicial position in Idaho by $17,000 per year. 
House Bill 205: This bill allows drivers to exceed the speed limit when they are using the passing lane to pass another vehicle on roads and highways outside of city limits with a speed limit of at least 55 mph. The law does not apply to vehicles passing on the right side.
Previously, state law allowed drivers to exceed the speed limit when they were passing on a two-lane road. The new bill adds passing lanes to that section of law. 
Senate Bill 1099: This bill provides for a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for a person who has previously been found guilty of driving under the influence and is again found guilty of DUI, along with vehicular manslaughter.
Senate Bill 1141: This bill establishes a statewide ban on sleeping in public places. The law bans public camping and sleeping on public property in Idaho cities with a population of at least 100,000 people. Some nonprofit organizations are concerned the law will create additional hardships for people experiencing homelessness in Idaho.
“There’s a lot of ambiguity about how this law will be enforced locally,” said Connor O’Hora, outreach team lead for the Boise-based housing nonprofit CATCH, in a written statement. “But what we do know is that it will disproportionately affect those who have no other place to go. Our immediate focus is getting people emergency supplies and protecting their health and safety in the heat.”
Senate Bill 1144: This bill adds a new section to state law that requires that, for new and existing highway projects, existing or new bicycle and pedestrian facilities may only be improved as a secondary or collateral benefit to any highway project, or to improve safety near schools, parks or other areas designated for bicycles and pedestrians.
 One notable Idaho law takes effect a year from now

One law, House Bill 37, takes effect in a year on July 1, 2026. That law makes it so that that firing squad will become the primary method of execution in Idaho, not lethal injection. 
Idaho Department of Correction officials have previously said they have had a difficult time obtaining chemicals to carry out a lethal injection. And in 2024, the state was unable to carry out the scheduled execution of death row inmate Thomas Creech after officials were unable to establish an IV line, the Sun previously reported.

(Getty Images)Participation in Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program grew by about 8.5% in the 2024-25 school year — marking a slowdown after record-setting enrollment growth in prior years. 
Even so, state spending reached nearly half a billion dollars on the private school voucher program, according to a new report released by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE). That’s up from $439 million spent on the program during the 2023-24 school year. 
The latest round of taxpayer-funded scholarships totaled roughly $497.2 million, representing a 13.2% increase compared to what the state paid the previous year. And despite an enrollment slowdown, more Hoosier students than ever before are participating — and more schools are accepting vouchers, too.
In total, 76,067 students received a Choice Scholarship during the 2024-25 school year, up from 70,095 in 2023-24. The number of private schools participating in the program also rose, from 357 to 373.
Voucher student breakdown
The average award in 2024-25 was $6,536. Vouchers are calculated as either 90% of a student’s local public school funding or the full amount of their private school tuition and fees, whichever is less. 
But participating schools reported an average tuition of $8,369 — meaning most families still paid out-of-pocket beyond the voucher amount.
More than 54,700 students received the 90% public-funding amount, per the IDOE report. Roughly 21,300 students received scholarships that covered their full tuition.
Story continues below.
2024-2025-Annual-Choice-Report
 
More than 45% of participating private schools now charge over $7,000 per year in tuition and fees, while fewer schools offer tuition below $5,000, according to the state report.
As a result, scholarships did not cover the full cost of tuition for 54,767 students enrolled in the voucher program, meaning families were responsible for paying a combined $133.9 million out-of-pocket for school costs. That amounts to an average of $2,447 per student.
The report additionally noted that if all voucher recipients had instead attended their traditional public public schools, the state would have spent approximately $567.8 million on their education. That’s because vouchers are paid at a lower amount than public school funding.
But many students have never attended public school, meaning the state obligation is new.
The majority of voucher users in the last school year — nearly 70% — had no record of attending a public school in Indiana, an increase of about three percentage points from 2023-24. The IDOE report said the rise was likely attributed to “students who were already enrolled at their Choice school now qualifying without prior attendance at an Indiana public school.”
Retention rates are up. About 76.8% of students who used a voucher in 2023-24 returned to the program this year, compared to 64.3% the year before.


Data shows white students make up the majority of voucher users at 64.29%. Hispanic students account for 17.53% of voucher participants, while Black students make up just shy of 8.82%. Those demographics are similar to the prior school year.
The latest data further reported that the average family income among voucher recipients was $102,843 — well below the income ceiling of roughly $230,000 for a family of four, but 50% higher than the annual income for an average Hoosier family, which is estimated to be about $70,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
State spending goes up — but so do school costs
Indiana lawmakers have steadily expanded the program since it launched in 2011, making it one of the largest voucher systems in the nation — and among the first to go fully universal. 
Ahead of the 2023-24 school year, participation surged by more than 30% after state lawmakers lifted income caps to include nearly all Indiana families. 
The expansion boosted funding from $311 million to $439 million in a single year and made vouchers are available to Hoosiers earning up to 400% of the amount required for a student to qualify for the free or reduced-price lunch program, or roughly $230,000. Only 3.5% of Indiana families were estimated to have annual incomes above those eligibility guidelines.
The incoming ceiling was removed entirely during the most recent legislative session and allows all Hoosier families to tap into private school voucher dollars beginning with the 2025-26 academic year.
The previous two-year state budget passed in 2023 allocated more than $1 billion for Choice Scholarships. The new biennial budget, which takes effect Tuesday, earmarked more than $1.2 billion. Voucher enrollment for the upcoming school year, along with total program costs, are still to be determined, however.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Feeding images to those monitors are 160-plus cameras overlooking the central village area, less than one square mile of the reservation, including tribal administrative and commercial businesses.
There’s a good chance there isn’t another northern Wisconsin public space with such a high concentration of cameras or a staff to monitor the live images that are also recorded and stored for a minimum of 30 days.
A post on the tribe’s Facebook page by Clinton D. Isham, first revealed the extent of the tribe’s surveillance capabilities to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
“Bro, all those cameras that the Tribal police put up better pay off. Police want to do surveillance on Indians to lock us up, but can’t use them to protect us,” Isham wrote.
Isham’s comment was directed at why those 160-plus cameras at LDF didn’t record any image of Melissa Beson, 37, a tribal member who was last seen on the reservation on March 17 – the site where Beson was last seen was just outside the area of the cameras.
LDF Tribal Police Chief T.J. Bill said there’s another tribe in the Midwest interested in replicating what LDF has created as a way to improve safety for tribal members.
The significant investment at LDF in surveillance prompted the question of whether other Wisconsin tribes have also secured surveillance systems to address safety concerns and whether they are considering acquiring additional surveillance technology.
The Examiner reached  out to most of the other 11 federally recognized Wisconsin tribes about their surveillance, and along with LDF, three others responded: Oneida, Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO), and St. Croix.
Police chiefs of the four tribes said it appears that there is a high interest in using surveillance technology among the tribes, particularly a technology called Flock. 
Overall, the police chiefs said tribal members are supportive of using surveillance technology, including a reported survey by one tribe that tallied over 80% support by its members.
While law enforcement officials said the use of surveillance technology and implementation of the Flock system was broadly popular among tribal members, the expansion of surveillance capabilities has drawn controversy elsewhere in Wisconsin. 
The Milwaukee Police Department and Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Department have recently been at the center of a debate about the use of surveillance cameras and Flock. 
“It is critical that our community has a say in if and how invasive surveillance technologies are used, how they are deployed against residents, if and how their data is stored and shared with third parties, and whether spending our limited tax dollars on surveillance technologies is the best way to promote public safety,” the ACLU of Wisconsin wrote in a May letter to the Milwaukee Common Council. 
Lac du Flambeau
Bill, the LDF tribal police chief, who began working with the tribe in 2013, stated that the surveillance system was already in place when he joined the department. He said that employees of the tribe’s IT department did the wiring and placement of the cameras, mostly between 2010 and 2011.
“It was directed by the tribal government, the tribal council, who wanted it for the protection of the people, for the safety of the public,” said Bill.
Bill said he didn’t know the motivation behind the creation of the surveillance system but noted that the LDF police department has been at the forefront of using technology and was one of the first law enforcement agencies in the area that had officers wearing body cameras.
“We don’t have 24/7 coverage,” he said of the cameras being monitored by staff, “but we strategically place them (staff) during the busy times, so it all depends on what’s going on, what our crime statistics tell us.”
Besides the 160 cameras, the tribe’s casino has its own internal surveillance system, which the casino monitors, a typical feature for casinos. The nearby LDF K-12 school also has its own surveillance system, which the police department can access and monitor.
With all the cameras in the LDF police department’s inventory, Beson wasn’t recorded because she was last seen in an area where there are no cameras. Bill said there have been efforts to put up remote cameras to monitor using cellular coverage, but cellular coverage is poor in the reservation and the county.
“We can’t rely on cellular-based equipment, especially during the summertime when our population goes from 4,000 individuals to 50,000 (including tourists and seasonal residents) because everyone is on their cell phones,” he said. “The cell service is horrible here in the Northwoods, so we have to rely on something else because we tried cameras in remote locations outside of the community where we can’t hook up electricity or fiber, and it doesn’t work.”
The Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation (DCI) helped LDF set up a surveillance camera on Highway 70 near a former hotel that was being used for drug sales and possible human trafficking, but because that camera used a cellular connection, it wasn’t reliable.
Bill said the tribe has used recorded surveillance video to prosecute several offenses, including a string of burglaries.
“We went through the surveillance cameras and we found a couple of different vehicles, and we located one vehicle of interest and were able to track that vehicle through town, even though it was nighttime, and we were able to make an arrest for the burglaries,” he said.
They’ve also made several drug arrests using surveillance images.
“We’re able to watch individuals who make transactions,” he said. “The cameras are so good that we’re able to see into the cars where they’re doing the deals and catch them. We see the money exchanged in the car and a package delivered to the other person.”
A live feed from the convenience store showed a man lifting his wallet out of his pants and a small baggie with a white substance falling out, which alerted one of the monitors.
“He walked out of there and didn’t realize he had dropped it,” said Bill. “We went over there and we picked it up and it was a bag of cocaine.” Later, the man was charged with possession.
The big question is, do all the cameras make people safer, and do they deter crime?
Bill said the serious drug dealers know about the cameras and stay out of that area, but there are still some who forget about the cameras or think they hide their actions, but that’s pretty difficult when there are 160-plus cameras in such a concentrated area.
“For the most part, in my opinion, it is a deterrent,” he said. “To those we have arrested and interviewed, they’ll say they are doing the crimes, the transactions, outside the area of the cameras because they are everywhere, so it is a deterrent for them not to do their activity directly in the community, so they take their criminal activity outside that area.”
Having recorded digital evidence, said Bill, helps prosecute offenses.
“You go to court and you provide the evidence, that’s a huge part, not only to help with the investigation but also to protect the officer from allegations.”
Bill said there is support for expanding the surveillance system. This summer, the tribe is looking at using recently laid fiber optic lines to expand the system, allowing cameras to provide coverage of the more rural areas of the reservation such as where Beson was last seen.
Bill said there haven’t been complaints from tribal members over a lack of privacy or a “Big Brother” complaint about being observed by authorities when they are in the village area of the reservation.
“You get a complaint here and there, but it’s very few,” he said. “We don’t get the Big Brother concern. Overall, the community is in support of it.”
Oneida Nation
Eric Boulanger is the chief of police for the Oneida Nation in Northeast Wisconsin near Green Bay.
According to Boulanger, Oneida has a Security Department that is part of the tribe’s gaming commission that monitors cameras in parking lots outside the casino and several different businesses and buildings, and the school has a security department that monitors cameras within the school that the police also have the ability to access.
Over two years ago, Oneida also invested in four Flock cameras for use by the police department, which uses cameras and computers to record and track license plates. With Flock, Oneida has also integrated with the larger Flock system, which allows for searching and tracking vehicles in other communities.
Boulanger said what drove the investment in Flock is the positive reports from other local law enforcement.
“It’s a great law enforcement tool in general, not just for Oneida but any community that uses them,” said Boulanger. “It’s a fairly advanced system, and you’re able to search for vehicles and plates and that sort of thing. It lets you know if what you’re looking for is in your area.”
He added, “If you have an incident and you have any sort of vehicle description or if you have a suspect and you know their vehicle information, you can enter that into the system and then it’ll give you feedback on whether or not that vehicle was in your area.”
He added, “If you’re looking for a white Ford Bronco, you can put those parameters in there, and then they’ll show you pictures of those vehicles in a particular area.”
He was asked if the four Flock cameras are sufficient to cover the reservation.
“In the future, we may expand it,” he said. “Everything comes with a cost. They’re not real affordable, but you know where we have them placed, and with the other agencies in the area and the ability to use theirs, there’s pretty good coverage right now of our main thoroughfares, and highly trafficked areas.”
Asked if the surveillance cameras and Flock cameras help deter crime at Oneida, he said, “Well, you would think they would, but there are still plenty of people doing stuff they shouldn’t be doing.” 
“The cameras aren’t hidden, so it’s quite obvious and it’s posted, the areas under surveillance, “but people still do what they’re going to do. So, I mean, I would imagine it would deter some people, but obviously, it doesn’t deter everybody.”
He noted that recorded footage is very useful in the prosecution of a crime.
“Jurors and judges and prosecutors and defense attorneys like to have video,” he said. “It’s kind of hard to dispute a claim on either side if there is video.”
Boulanger hasn’t heard objections to the surveillance cameras or Flock.
“I haven’t heard any specific comments, nobody has directly addressed concerns with me about it, but I feel our community is pretty public safety cautious, so I think they’re probably more on the side of in favor of it than anybody would be against,” he said.
Lac Courte Oreilles
The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indian Tribal Chief Susie Taylor said the tribal police doesn’t have a surveillance system of cameras operated by the police department or a special security department. Still, police have used footage from the casino for investigations, and the K-12 school does have its own surveillance system of cameras.
She notes that former chief of police Tim DeBrot was instrumental in securing Flock cameras for the tribe, which were placed earlier this year.
Taylor said the Flock cameras record and track information about vehicles, but they will not be used for speeding violations. She said the primary use is in the investigation of crimes.
In March, Taylor put out a press release about the Flock cameras that was printed in the Lac Courte Oreilles News:
“Flock cameras are designed to enhance public safety by capturing objective evidence, including license plate information, to help law enforcement prevent and solve crimes. These cameras do not use facial recognition and are not intended for traffic enforcement. Instead, they serve as a valuable investigative tool to identify stolen vehicles, locate missing children and adults, and deter criminal activity.”
In the press release, Taylor noted that the data from the cameras is stored and then deleted after a certain number of days if it is not being used in an investigation, and access to the information is limited to “authorized personnel” and not used for “surveillance or tracking individuals without cause.”
She also noted to the Wisconsin Examiner that the Flock cameras, by tying into the larger network of cameras, allow for the sharing of information across jurisdictional boundaries.
“Many other law enforcement agencies across the country have implemented Flock cameras due to their effectiveness in reducing crime and enhancing community safety,” she said.
She noted there are Flock cameras off the region’s major highway, Highway 53, located in Washburn County, that would be very effective in helping track a vehicle that had been on the reservation in Sawyer County.
Joe Morey, public relations director for LCO, said a survey of tribal members had been conducted regarding the use of surveillance technology, and over 80% of respondents were in support.
St. Croix
Of the four tribes, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians has the least investment and deployment of surveillance equipment.
According to police chief Donnie Holmes, in 2014-15, the St. Croix Tribal Police Department began using body cameras.
Holmes said his office will place stand-alone cameras to address individual complaints or for investigations.  As an example, he mentioned that there were complaints at the Sand Lake basketball court and parking area, where robberies had occurred, so cameras were installed on the assumption that the criminals might return.
Individual tribal businesses have their own security system for recording video that could be used for an investigation or prosecution.
“Super expensive,” Holmes said of the cost of implementing a surveillance system for St. Croix similar to LDF’s or even Oneida’s. He said for St. Croix it would be even more of a challenge in that the reservation is located in pockets of land over four different counties: Burnett, Barron, Douglas and Polk.
However, St. Croix is exploring the acquisition of Flock cameras. The biggest factor against proceeding is the cost.
Holmes appreciates the capability of Flock cameras, especially for integrating with other Flock cameras to track a suspect’s vehicle. If a vehicle can be identified, Holmes believes Flock cameras would be helpful locating a missing person.
“The nice thing about Flock is they can alert to car movements with other cameras tied to the system,” he said.
Holmes was asked if tribal members would have any objections to having a more advanced surveillance system, and he noted that there is some interest in investing in technology, but he also wonders if there would be objections over privacy rights if a surveillance system became too expansive.
Flock
Holly Beilin, director of communication for Flock, said in Wisconsin three tribes are using Flock cameras and in the United States 24 tribes have it, but because of confidentiality, she cannot identify which tribes have it.
Boulanger, the Oneida Nation chief, was asked why he thinks tribes are showing an interest in Flock cameras.
“With technology it’s a useful investigative tool,” he said, “And if you know any tribal agencies or tribal nations that have independent police departments and can fiscally handle the cost, it is probably going to look towards some sort of Flock or surveillance system just because that’s the trend right now in law enforcement, using technology.”
Beilin objected when told that at least two of the police chiefs said the Flock system is pricey.
“We typically hear it is much more cost-effective than other solutions,” she responded.
One of the big issues across Indian Country is missing and murdered indigenous women and relatives. The Flock cameras can be especially helpful for missing persons because they are automatically tied to Amber Alerts for children and Silver Alerts for seniors.
Beilin said Flock is working on incorporating the new federal alert for Native Americans, called Missing and Endangered Persons (MEP), which will be implemented later in 2025 and will be known as Turquoise Alerts.
“If a vehicle is associated with an Amber Alert, the license plate passes a camera in real time and will alert local law enforcement, so that law enforcement know, like, OK, that vehicle just passed this camera and is going in this direction, so it’ll be, you know, at this location, in five minutes,’” she said, “and they can actually go, hopefully, and apprehend that person.”
However, she noted that those who use the Flock system don’t have to tie into the larger network of Flock cameras and instead can  just use them locally. She also noted the local user is responsible for how long information is stored.
“No customer has to share,” she said. “So if a tribe wanted to share with local law enforcement nearby, they could, and if they wanted to just have their own police get those alerts and use it for investigations. That would also be fine,”
She was asked what is Flock’s appeal for tribes.
“It actually works,” she said. “It solves crime, and it helps find missing persons. I mean, we just really see that as soon as the cameras are installed, it starts to actually help these agencies or these tribes. You know, the vast majority of crime has some kind of a vehicle involved, right? Which makes sense. We all literally drive daily, and as do folks who commit crime.”
As for whether the Flock system infringes upon privacy rights,“We don’t own the data, the agencies or the tribes do, so they can choose what to do with it,” she said. “We can never sell it or share it without their permission. They can set or legislate their own retention period, so maybe they only want to keep the data for. Our default (to erase data collected) is 30 days, but it could be even less.”
Cameras in the Southwest 
Sergio DeSoto is a consultant from Arizona who works with tribes in the Southwestern areas of the United States on surveillance systems. He said that most tribes he has worked with invest in camera security after an incident has raised safety concerns.
“We hear, ‘we want to make sure our people are safe,’” he said.
DeSoto said surveillance cameras are typically requested for housing, administration, courts, and border security, and most tribes have staff who live-monitor cameras.
The safety concern can be over external issues like sex trafficking on the reservation, or internal issues of domestic disputes or alcohol or drug-related issues.
He said the No. 1  motivation for the tribal nation he deals with is personal safety.
“They’re not interested in the assets; they’re more interested in the people,” he said.
Typically, he said, there is an issue or an incident that drives a discussion about how to raise safety at a particular location, such as a homicide in tribal housing. Once the surveillance system has been in place for a while, the tribe often requests help focusing on other areas on the reservation.
DeSota said the tribal councils are also learning the importance of educating tribal members before implementing a new surveillance system.
“With the elder center in Quechan (Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe in Yuma, Arizona), the tribal council did a super good job communicating with them that we want to make sure everybody’s safe,” he said.
Regarding the question of whether surveillance cameras help deter crime and increase safety, DeSota said he doesn’t have any data to support that contention. However, he noted that when tribes consistently seek to expand their systems, it would indicate that they are receiving positive feedback.

He's staying -- for now -- but, like many business owners, is worried about the impact of the law.","Victor Bencomo, an IT specialist at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow in California, updates a desktop in this 2017 file photo. Critics of Maryland's new tech tax worry about its impact on small firms wonking on Defense conrtracts, among others. (Photo by Keith Hayes/U.S. Marine Corps)When Maryland first announced its new 3% sales and use tax on data and information technology services this spring, Jake Stokes felt his business had no choice but to leave the state.
But after the Maryland Comptroller’s Office issued more guidance on the new regulations, including that pre-existing contracts would be exempt from the tax, he decided to stay. For the time being.
“We started to feel good — or at least that we bought time,” said Stokes, president of the Maryland-based government subcontractor Belay Technologies.
Depending on what regulatory decisions the state makes regarding the implementation of the tax, though, Stokes said he is ready to move the company to Texas — where he already has several employees.
Stokes is one of many Maryland business leaders expressing concern over the impact of the state’s new tax on data and information technology services and software publishing. Some said the tax will hurt Maryland’s economy more than any revenue it will generate.
The new tax, which took effect Tuesday, is expected to generate about $480 million in revenue for the state in its first year, with the amount approaching $750 million by fiscal 2030. The tax will apply to a range of businesses, including computer systems design, software publishing, data processing and hosting, and other services from news to libraries, internet publishing to web search portals.
New ‘tech tax’ dominates list of laws that take effect July 1, start of fiscal 2026

In a statement Monday, Gov. Wes Moore’s office defended the taxes, saying the governor worked with the Maryland General Assembly this session to turn the projected $3 billion budget deficit into a $315 million budget surplus, while still providing 94% of Maryland residents with a tax cut or no change in their income taxes.
Moore said that after “years of economic stagnation … Maryland’s economy is finally moving again. In just two years, Maryland has added over 100,000 jobs, more jobs than the previous eight years—which has recently been driven by private sector growth.”
That progress is “only possible” because Moore and other state and local leaders passed legislation that “will grow Maryland’s economy and ensure the long-term fiscal stability of the state,” the statement read.
Grason Wiggins, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce’s vice president of government affairs, agreed that the state needs more economic growth. But he said the tech tax will only serve to make the state less economically competitive with its neighboring states.
“This tax is going to make it more difficult for us to attract businesses,” Wiggins said. “It’s going to make doing business more costly here in the state of Maryland.”
The tax won’t just affect business owners, Wiggins added. Because of the broad range of services included under the tax, the cost will be passed down to consumers through increased prices of services and goods, he said.
Wiggins added that he has seen some companies indicating they are planning to leave Maryland, and has spent the last two months pleading with them to stay.
The only way to solve a budget deficit, Wiggins said, is to generate more economic growth.
“This may have plugged a hole,” he said. “But from a long-term perspective, if it drives businesses away, if it reduces job creation and limits spending, then from a long-term perspective, it’s really just moving the issue down the road and not really solving the problem.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some politicians, such as Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), have also voiced their concerns over the tax. Crosby, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, said it will have a “heavy impact” on defense contracting, one of the state’s emerging sectors.
It’s not an abstract concept to Crosby, the owner of a small business that is a subcontractor on Defense Department IT contracts: At the height of the debate over the tech tax this year, he acknowledged that he moved his business to Virginia because he did not think it could survive if he had to pay the tech tax in Maryland.
He added that he is worried about the impact it will have on other small businesses, particularly minority-owned, women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Larger contractors will have no incentive to work with smaller businesses outside of “set aside” contracts, he said.
Karen Syrylo, a Maryland-based certified public accountant, said she has heard complaints with the new tax for two main reasons: complicated legislative wording and complicated implementation.
The tax’s legislative wording is too confusing as it uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), a standard used by the federal government to classify types of businesses, to define services that fall under the tax, rather than creating its own definitions, she said.
Syrylo added that it has also been complicated for businesses to install the systems necessary to ensure that the vendor and purchaser are subject to tax.
She said tax will affect an “entire universe of purchasers.”
“Every business and every individual who buys any of these dozens and dozens of services are going to be paying more tax to their vendors,” Syrylo said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/3705942-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 07:00:42.685367

Of the 81% who want their communities to plan for climate-related water changes, less than half know that most of their neighbors feel the same.
The post Wyoming warming to climate change reality and worried about water, UW poll finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming residents are feeling the heat, and they’re more concerned than ever about what it means, particularly for water — a scarce commodity in the arid state.
The state is historically among the most skeptical in the nation when it comes to embracing climate change, but a new University of Wyoming survey reveals that attitudes are changing even with an economy heavily reliant on fossil fuel extraction.
The vast majority of residents, 86%, “believe that climate change is happening,” according to the Wyoming Survey on Climate, Water, and People. Though they’re split on the reasons for it, with 47% believing it’s natural and 39% acknowledging humans are the cause, the survey helps confirm that Wyomingites are increasingly concerned. Back in 2014, for example, just 55% of Equality State residents believed climate change was happening, according to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication.

“That’s a huge change in 10 years,” said Kristen Landreville, lead author of the survey. Despite being split on the cause, “there is concern,” she added. “There is worry and there is a desire for action.”
Water concerns
It’s difficult to determine exactly why more Wyomingites are acknowledging climate change these days, Landreville said. Though the topic is constantly in the news, it likely has more to do with personal observations and local issues — particularly when it comes to water and past experiences with drought.

A University of Wyoming survey found that 39% respondents believe climate change is due to humans. (University of Wyoming)
In fact, the survey purposely led with questions about water before asking about climate, Landreville said. Whether it’s those in agriculture who rely on water or recreationalists who fish and boat, people notice variations in Wyoming’s seasonal pulse of water, which has been changing.
The survey found that 82% of respondents agreed that “Wyoming is at risk of changing water resources,” and 75% believe “it is wise and necessary to adapt to these water changes.”
It also showed broad support for various water conservation measures, including water reuse, voluntary water conservation in agriculture and a close look at industrial use. Respondents also said they trust their neighbors in agriculture more than industry officials when it comes to a clear-eyed view of Wyoming’s water risks, according to Landreville.
“Only 7% of our respondents trusted industry to tell them the truth about what’s going on with water in the state,” she said. “What’s interesting is that Wyoming ranchers and farmers were the second most-trusted group.”
Feeling alone, but not actually alone
Perhaps the most exciting results of the survey — at least for a social and communication researcher like Landreville, she admitted — is that Wyomingites vastly underestimate how much they agree on their growing climate-related water concerns, as well as a desire to do something about it. 
Of the 81% who want their communities to plan for climate-related water changes, fewer than half believe their neighbors feel the same way, according to the survey.
That massive disconnect, Landreville said, can drive a “spiral of silence” that leads to inaction and less pressure on elected officials to implement solutions. However, knowing there’s more agreement than residents previously realized is a huge opportunity to spur action at the local and state levels, she added.
“There’s more support [than understood] for creating community response plans,” Landreville said. “There’s more support for addressing water changes than Wyoming residents think. An implication of these findings, I think, is that it’s really important to share with people, ‘You know what? You’re not that different than your own community.'”
The survey, conducted by the University of Wyoming’s Center for Rural Resilience and Innovation, was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. You can view an interactive report on the survey here and read the full report here.
The Center for Rural Resilience and Innovation will be conducting more focus groups and community discussions around these issues in the near future, Landreville said.

The federal lawsuit fails to demonstrate how the new requirements could harm potential voters, attorneys for Gray argue. 
The post Gray asks court to toss case challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law appeared first on WyoFile .","Attorneys for Secretary of State Chuck Gray asked a federal court Friday to dismiss a lawsuit against Wyoming’s new voter registration law, arguing in two filings that the complaint does not sufficiently demonstrate how the new requirements could harm potential voters. 
Once the law goes into effect Tuesday, proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship will be required to register to vote in Wyoming. The law also requires someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group made up of several nonprofits, filed a lawsuit in May after the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications” during the 2025 session. 
The complaint alleges the new law is unconstitutionally vague as written and will impose an undue burden on the right to vote — particularly for women as well as Hispanic, young and low-income voters. 
The harms described in the complaint, however, are speculative and lack the kind of specificity required to have standing in a federal court, Gray’s attorneys argued in Friday’s filings. 
“Plaintiffs liberally assert these broad, sweeping claims, without bothering to submit supporting evidence,” attorneys with Dhillon Law Group argue. 
“For example, they have not identified even one woman, one Hispanic citizen, one impoverished individual, one transgender citizen, or one person with epilepsy who cannot vote because Wyoming wishes to enforce the citizenship requirement embodied in both federal and state law. Nor can the plaintiff offer any method to reliably measure the likelihood or extent, if any, of such hypothetical difficulties in Wyoming.”
The law was a key priority for the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Gray, whom the complaint names as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks. 
“Wyomingites deserve fair, transparent elections and that’s why we are fighting tooth and nail to protect these election integrity measures,” Gray said in a Monday press release. 
The case’s profile has risen considerably since it was first filed, attracting high-profile attorneys who have fought for and against President Trump on the national stage. Ahead of Gray’s filings on Friday, the Republican National Committee filed a motion to intervene in the case while a coalition of 25 states plus Guam filed a proposed amicus brief, urging the court to allow the law to go into effect.

Legal fight
Shortly after Equality State Policy Center filed its complaint, attorneys for the group sought a preliminary injunction, asking the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
Gray responded with two motions — one asking the court to allow the law to go into effect, another asking that the complaint be dismissed entirely. 
In the first filing, attorneys for Gray argue that ESPC has not demonstrated that the law will impose a severe burden on the right to vote, and that Wyoming has a compelling interest in enforcing current federal and state laws that limit voting to U.S. citizens. 
“Plaintiff’s request to preliminarily enjoin HB 156 — without evidence of actual harm, and well in advance of any election — is both premature and legally unfounded. Therefore, the motion [for a preliminary injunction] should be denied,” the filing states. 
Attorneys for Gray fleshed out their argument further in a motion to dismiss, arguing the plaintiff does not have standing, or the right to bring the lawsuit,   for three reasons.
The first centers on a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision. 
ESPC argued in its complaint that the new law will impede its “core work of encouraging voters to register and participate in their democracy” and would require the group “to redirect significant resources to increase its voter registration education efforts.”
But when several anti-abortion groups challenged the Food and Drug Administration’s approval and subsequent actions regarding mifepristone — arguing it forced them to conduct their own studies of the drug — the high court ruled that did not give them standing. 
“In short, increased educational efforts or advocacy efforts are not a concrete, particularized injury that establishes standing,” Gray’s filing argues.
Second, Gray’s attorneys say the plaintiffs failed to identify anyone who will be harmed by the law. 
As part of its legal strategy, ESPC included several affidavits from individuals explaining potential harms of the new law, including the organization’s executive director, Jennifer DeSarro, as well as representatives from both a homeless shelter and a food pantry, both in Cheyenne. 
“Despite Plaintiff’s claims of widespread harm, it has only identified one member organization that claims harm to its members,” Gray’s filings state, pointing to an affidavit from the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. (Emphasis from the filing.)
“But this sole member has failed to meet the requirements” to have standing, the filing argues. 
“Third, to the extent Plaintiff argues its members’ members will face injury, such injuries are speculative, at best, and, thus, cannot serve as a basis for Plaintiff’s standing.”
Equality State Policy Center now has until July 9 to file a response.

The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
USDA Secretary in Santa Fe announces agency intends to repeal Clinton-era ‘roadless’ rule

But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.

Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
 Public pushes back on land sell-off proposal from Utah senator

The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”

But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
 States’ role in managing public lands

While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
 Other Trump administration proposals slash environmental rules and expand logging, mining

While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.













The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers





“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“If you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Caregivers for people with developmental disabilities may see boost to a living wage, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Even Freedom Caucus lawmaker sees need for supporting Wyoming’s developmental disabilities program appeared first on WyoFile .","I never dreamed I would hear a conservative Wyoming lawmaker boldly proclaim that a social safety net program is “one of the reasons why we have government.”

Opinion

Such enthusiasm in the Wyoming Legislature is generally reserved for subsidizing the fossil fuel industry or bringing an expensive project to a legislator’s district. A favorite tactic of far-right politicians is to portray themselves as budget hawks by railing about social programs that the state and federal government shouldn’t waste taxpayers’ money on.
So when Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, strongly came out in favor of the state significantly boosting the budget of the Medicaid developmental disabilities waiver program last week at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting in Gillette, it genuinely startled me. I’m on the opposite end of the political spectrum, but he’s spot on in his assessment that the program “is something that’s absolutely worthy of supporting and worthy of doing right.” 
A state study last year recommended adding $12 million to the Department of Health’s budget to increase the reimbursement rate for more than 570 providers who care for about 2,500 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or acquired brain injuries in home and community-based alternatives to an institution.
Unfortunately, while a steering committee published the report, it didn’t recommend forwarding the funding request to the Legislature. The committee said a low response rate to a provider survey resulted in the decision.
The Department of Health, the Legislative Service Office and many providers are correcting that problem, giving the Appropriations Committee stacks of white papers and promising to compile more.


The Legislature’s Management Council approved Appropriations’ request to make the issue a priority during the interim. The committee will meet Aug. 19-20 in Dubois, with a trip to a developmental disabilities provider tentatively on the agenda.
Pendergraft could have played it safe and tried to please the Freedom Caucus, which endorsed his candidacy last year. But he chose to speak his mind on an issue he obviously feels passionate about.
I don’t know if the Freedom Caucus will take an official position on the disability waiver program in 2026, but I do know that after it took control of the House earlier this year, the caucus killed a $2.4 million a year raise in the Medicaid reimbursement rate for maternity health care requested by Gov. Mark Gordon and the Department of Health. The proposed higher disability waiver reimbursement rate is a similar issue for a vulnerable population that’s about five times more expensive.
Pendergraft, like the majority of Republicans in the House, voted against the rate increase for maternity care.
Pendergraft has a very personal reason for his position on the waiver issue. He explained that a man who belonged to his church suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident when he stopped to help a stalled motorist. The family lost its income and had astronomical medical bills, he said, so about a dozen church families helped his wife start a business.
“[The congregation] made tremendous sacrifices,” he recalled. “We paid the bills, we provided care for this individual, who needed constant care day and night.”
Jaded from years of hearing lawmakers contend almost every social problem, from juvenile delinquency to teen pregnancies, can be solved by putting it in the hands of churches instead of throwing public money at it, I wondered if Pendergraft was going down that well-traveled road. But he didn’t.
The legislator told the committee he and his wife provided care for a relative at their home for several years until she moved to a group home, and a co-worker who had a developmentally disabled child needed more help than the state could provide.
Citing his experience working at a nursing home and the long hours he spent helping the three families, Pendergraft said that state and federal governments, which split the costs, should reimburse providers at a level that will help them pay private caregivers competitive wages.
Daryl Skinner, executive director of Lincoln Self Reliance, agreed. He said staff turnover hurts the quality of care.
“The average length of time for direct care staff is six months,” he said. “Can you imagine having to retrain employees every six months? It’s a revolving door.”
Skinner said caregivers have to pass a medication training program, and medication errors increase with staff turnover. He added it takes time for new workers to learn how to interact and communicate with individuals who may be nonverbal and aggressive.
“People say, ‘I love this work, it’s the most meaningful experience I’ve ever had, but I can’t afford to pay my living expenses,’” Skinner said. “We pay an average wage of $16.81 an hour. Fifty percent of our workforce commutes to Jackson Hole, where dishwashers are paid $25 an hour.”
Though Pendergraft said he definitely wants to see waiver reimbursement rates raised, he also showed he’s not above playing some political games to accomplish that goal. 
“Before I sit down and authorize a $20-or-$30-or-$40 million check, knowing that taxpayers are already sacrificing, I want to look across the breadth of the Department of Health,” Pendergraft said. “ If it considers this to be a high priority, what’s it willing to sacrifice to pay for it?”
Pendergraft said the state only has a limited amount of money. “If you’re going to fund [higher DD waiver rates] you do it right, and you pay people what they should be paid,” he said. “And when you run out of money, you stop the spending.”
Stefan Johansson, the Department of Health’s director, had a diplomatic response. While he said he’s always open to looking at places to trim, his department had three rounds of budget cuts in the past dozen years that were “all north of $100 million.”
The state has increased funds when it could, like in 2023, when the Legislature added $6.3 million for higher reimbursement rates for providers and $7.4 million to reduce wait times for people who need disability waivers. Currently, the average wait to obtain services is about 14 months.
Johansson didn’t spell it out directly, but I detected a clear message: The state has made a lot of budget cuts in main programs, including Medicaid waivers, developmental preschools, mental health and substance abuse services at community mental health centers, and 24/7 facilities like the Wyoming State Hospital and Wyoming’s Life Resource Center. 
These programs are either required to be offered under federal law or part of lawsuit settlements. They account for more than 90% of the department’s biennial budget. If someone wants to cut a lot of “fat,” there aren’t many places to look.
Appropriations Committee Co-chair Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, had some encouraging words for Johansson.
“I know the challenges you face with limited dollars. I believe you’re doing everything you possibly can on this issue, given the budget that you have, and so I appreciate your efforts; I appreciate your attention,” Salazar said. “I’m not positive, but I tend to think help is on the way.”
That’s not a promise, but given the Legislature’s desire to cut budgets, it’s about as hopeful a sign as can be expected six months before the next session.

But this year is different, for many reasons, the most important being that just a couple of weeks ago, one of my best friends in recovery passed away from an overdose. 
It was a stark reminder of just how devastating this disease can be, and how dramatically things can change.
My friend worked very hard at his recovery for many years, and then he made some bad decisions that led to a series of relapses, and for the last few years, it was absolutely heartbreaking watching him try to get back to where he was a few years ago.
Diligence and perseverance are two of the most crucial qualities to sustaining a sober life, and once you lose one or the other of these, it can be frightening how hard it is to pull yourself back into that mindset. You’ve probably all experienced what it feels like to work out for a consistent period of time, and then get away from it. When you start again, it’s so easy to find excuses, especially the most convincing excuse, which is that you have plenty of time to resume your routine. That it doesn’t have to happen now. So you put it off one more day, and then one more day, and when you try to start over again, you get frustrated because it isn’t as easy as it was before. You can’t just pick up where you left off .
My friend couldn’t get back to the routine, and it became clear over time that what he really wanted was to to regain that feeling he had when he was sober without having to work as hard as he did those first few months or years that it took to achieve that level of serenity and well being. The hardest part about watching someone go through that is the helpless feeling of not knowing what to say. Because you both know that they know what they need to do. You both know that there’s no magic phrase or magic action that will restore that sense of happiness they once held so dear. It’s impossible.
So I have never felt as grateful as I do now for having been able to maintain my sobriety, for 42 years now. 
Forty-two years ago today, I stood up from the dining room table and told my wife at the time that I needed to get drunk. She didn’t argue with me or try to stop me because she knew it wouldn’t work. I ended up going to a sad little bar that is about five blocks from the house where I live now. I drank a few shots of whiskey and a few bottles of beer before she somehow found me and walked in.
“Do you want to come home?” she asked, and I did.
I never imagined that would be my last drink. In fact, I didn’t trust myself for a couple of years after that because I had been relapsing for two-and-a-half years before that last time. But amazingly, it was the last time. And my life has been a magic carpet ride ever since, filled with tragedy and triumph, sadness and absolute joy. Pain and euphoria. But never, ever dull. 
I would not be who I am today without sobriety. I would never have had the persistence to become a writer, much less publish eight books. The rejection would have killed whatever motivation I had years ago. 
And I never would have taken the risk to explore mediums that were completely out of my comfort zone, like doing a radio show or a podcast. I didn’t have the confidence or the ability to ignore people who find it necessary to criticize or even sabotage my work. I firmly believe in the saying that you hear often in AA, that what other people think of you is none of your business. I also believe that seeking revenge is like digging two graves. So I leave that to others. I seek to put positive vibes into the world, and even when I fail, I know I’m doing the best I can, as long as I don’t take that first drink.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1320844709-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 12:19:33.126941

It’s a sad commentary on the power of the right-wing misinformation machine in modern America that simple and enormously positive concepts like diversity, equity and inclusion have been twisted so that some perceive them in a negative light.
What’s next on the hit list? Words like love, tolerance and common ground?
Tragically, however, as North Carolina Republican legislators made clear last week, they’re serious about this perverse crusade – so serious that they recently passed legislation that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion in state government.
The bill is so ill-conceived and poorly written that it would likely prohibit state agencies from recruiting employees at women’s colleges and HBCU’s.
Even programs to help accommodate the needs of veterans and people with disabilities would likely be unlawful.
The bottom line: The sponsors of this legislation claim that their attacks on DEI are about promoting equal opportunity. In truth they’re about promoting three words that are the opposite of DEI – call it UIE: uniformity, inequity and exclusion.

As Anita Wolfe sat in the hallway of a Charleston, West Virginia, county courtroom, waiting to testify against the U.S. government, she thought of her dad, who first started working as a coal miner when he was around 12.
She remembered his wild stories about coal-loading contests and working as a mule boy. But she also remembered his death certificate, which listed black lung and silicosis, two pulmonary diseases related to dust in mines, as contributing factors.
Before she retired, Wolfe launched and ran a mobile clinic through the National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that screened miners at their mines and tried to catch lung diseases early.

In April, as part of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, around 90% of NIOSH staff received layoff notices. Many were placed on administrative leave — including the mobile clinic crew, workers who review miners’ test results and researchers trying to prevent these lung diseases in the first place.
Wolfe was in the courthouse to try to get those jobs back. Now, her mobile clinic workers are back, along with all the other workers in the institute’s Respiratory Health Division. But researchers elsewhere in NIOSH who also work on prevention are still slated to be laid off. 
To Wolfe, that’s a problem. About a fifth of the coal miners in Central Appalachia have black lung, Wolfe said. And from 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 died. Nationally, a 2023 NIOSH study found that coal miners are twice as likely to die of lung diseases than nonminers. Wolfe called black lung and silicosis “entirely preventable.” 
“It comes down to how much is a life worth,” Wolfe said. “You want more coal, but you don’t care about the coal miners and what’s happening to them.”
*   *   *For some coal miners, pausing the black lung programs at the National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health created an immediate problem, because without a stamp of approval from the institute, coal miners can’t access federal “Part 90” benefits that allow them to get reassigned to jobs with less dust exposure. 
Black lung has no cure, but avoiding dust can stop the disease from getting worse. With the pause, X-rays and medical records now sat in folders, unexamined. 
So Wolfe and others began campaigning, collaborating with public health workers and miners to try to get the NIOSH workers back. Wolfe enlisted the support of West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who successfully petitioned to get black lung workers off administrative leave in the short term. Still, that was just a temporary fix.
Sam Petsonk, a lawyer, and Harry Wiley, a coal miner, decided to sue the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIOSH. “To me, he was very courageous for doing that,” Wolfe said of Wiley. 
At trial, Wolfe and Wiley were both called to testify, and on May 7, they sat with other witnesses in the courthouse hallway. For hours, the group made small talk about kids and summer vacations, scrupulously following instructions to avoid any chatter about the department’s “reduction in force.”

One by one the witnesses entered the courtroom. Wolfe was last. “Everything was going through my head,” she said. She was nervous. But then, she remembered her dad. “I just felt like he was there with me, you know? Kinda egging me on, like, ‘You got this, baby girl.’”
When Wolfe took the stand, she was calm, and described the value of NIOSH’s programs. The defense, she said, “didn’t offer much defense at all.” 
After the trial, Wolfe joined Wiley and Petsonk for sandwiches. “They seemed fairly confident that it was gonna be found in favor of the miner,” she said. 
A few days later, the judge ruled in Wiley’s favor. Staff at the mobile clinic and the broader National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health Respiratory Health Division got their jobs back for now, although the program is still working to get back up and running. Staff at the institute’s National Personal Protective Technology Lab were also called back; they certify a variety of respirators that help keep miners and other workers safe.
But other institute researchers working to prevent mining-related lung diseases heard nothing. 
While researchers in the Respiratory Health Division focus primarily on tracking disease and helping individual miners, researchers at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh and Spokane Mining Research Divisions focus on innovation, developing new tools to prevent disease in the first place.  
The judge’s preliminary injunction said the law requires that kind of research. But the injunction did not explicitly put Pittsburgh and Spokane researchers back to work.
The Department of Health and Human Services did un-fire their boss, a statutorily required associate director overseeing the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research. But it did not bring back the hundreds of researchers who report to that administrator.
“He’s new. He hasn’t even met us yet!” said Cassandra Hoebbel, a NIOSH researcher in Pittsburgh and a union steward for the Association of Federal Government Employees. 
“A lot of people contacted me and were like, ‘Oh my God, you got your job restored!’” she said. “It’s like, no they’ve only restored a tiny part of it.”
Hoebbel said that mine health and safety research at the institute has been mostly on pause since January due to the Trump administration’s restrictions on funding and travel. For almost five months, researchers have been unable to visit mines to measure dust levels, test new equipment or improve software tools. 
That’s a long-term loss for miner health, but it’s a short-term loss as well: NIOSH field work often leads to quick-fix changes by the mine operators the researchers collaborate with. Now, those improvements aren’t happening. External grants for technology development and commercialization were also “terminated for convenience.”  
That’s despite the fact that, after a long decline, lung diseases in miners are again on the rise: Black lung cases have been increasing for two decades, according to a 2018 NIOSH study, and severe cases have caught back up to their all-time high. And it’s not just black lung. A 2023 study found that coal miners are dying of a variety of lung diseases at higher rates than in the past. Some are also dying younger.
*   *   *“It used to be that people said black lung was an old man’s disease, and that’s not true. We just buried a thirtysomething miner,” Wolfe said.
Many younger miners suffer from lung diseases caused not by coal dust but from quartz dust, officially called respirable crystalline silica. As coal deposits became tapped out, mines went after harder-to-reach coal, generating more quartz dust from the surrounding rock. Modern mining machines may also contribute to the dust. 
Silica dust exposure is not unique to coal miners, who represent a small sliver of miners in the U.S. Silicosis is common in miners at all sorts of mines. 
While coal workers are eligible for “Part 90” transfers and benefits based on dust exposure, those who mine for sand, rocks, precious metals and other material are not. 
For all miners, silica dust protections are decades out of date. After Wolfe’s mobile clinics helped identify new clusters of lung disease, a 2014 rule lowered allowable limits for coal dust exposure. Similar standards lowered limits for silica dust in industries like construction.

But a rule to lower by half the silica dust exposure limit in mines stalled for a decade. The rule finally passed in 2024 — then a 2025 start date was postponed, after pushback from mine operators, who said implementation would be too difficult.
Mine operators objected to a final version of the rule that said it was not enough to implement a check list of “good enough” dust control measures, to give miners masks or to rotate them in and out of dusty areas to reduce their exposure. Instead, the final rule says mines need to actually reduce the hazardous dust.
The rule also mandates silicosis monitoring programs, similar to Wolfe’s black lung monitoring work, but for non-coal miners.
However, the same day President Donald Trump held a press conference promoting the “abandoned” coal industry, the Department of Labor postponed the rule’s upcoming start date for coal mines from April to August. (Stone mines still have until April 2026 to comply.)
Earlier this year, the Department of Labor announced plans to close 34 of the mine enforcement offices that work to hold mine operators accountable for the current silica dust standard. In late May, those plans were reversed.
*   *   *Dust is a constant presence in mines, and it lurks in overlooked places. Currently paused National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health research has the potential to improve the dust problem. 
Decades ago, government mine safety researchers identified controls that could be used to reduce dust in mines, such as improving ventilation. 
But mines have been using those strategies for years, and lung diseases stubbornly persist.
Traditionally, mine inspectors check dust levels a few times a year to confirm compliance. But those checks don’t provide much actionable information about how to make things better. That’s frustrating for mines and for miners. So NIOSH has been working on ways to make dust easier to spot.
Their personal dust monitors already let miners view their own mine dust exposure in real time. Other projects are helping miners make sense of that kind of data.
In 2015, Hoebbel observed field work for an award-winning study by institute researcher Emily Haas that outfitted miners with both a dust monitor and a video camera and then compared the feeds to see why dust levels spiked.
“They had two guys walking side by side,” Hoebbel said. One of their dust monitors “kept going up, up, up — and the other guy was walking right next to him and his was fine.”
The researchers, curious, asked, “When’s the last time you washed your sweatshirt?” Hoebbel said. “He’s like, ‘Oh man, I can’t tell you the last time I washed this thing!’” 
Before the study, the participating miners felt confident that wearing masks and following established procedures would keep them safe. Afterwards, they were full of questions about silica exposure. The mine in the study, for its part, replaced cloth vehicle seats and gloves with leather, which is easier to wipe clean. 
But attaching monitors to miners, while good for sussing out dirty sweatshirts, is less effective for tracking dirty equipment or faulty ventilation, which may be getting dust on sweatshirts in the first place.

So another institute project used air quality monitors to help mines and miners better understand sources of exposure within mines. In a recently published pilot study, weekly reports of real-time data helped staff at sand mine notice minute by minute shifts in dust at key locations. 
As a result, the mine’s industrial hygienist turned some machines on before miners arrived for the day, so they wouldn’t be exposed to an extra burst of dust that spiked when machines were starting up. 
A foreman also noticed a dust hot spot near a particular conveyor belt and used parts they had on hand to come up with a fix, reducing dust in the area threefold.
The approach is promising, and NIOSH has a history of creating useful gadgets for miners that are now widely used and often legally required. From October to January, those researchers made several site visits. Then, nothing. 
That project is currently paused, along with much of NIOSH’s other research into silica exposure and impacts.
Many dust monitors test general dust levels; teasing out silica in particular means distinguishing one speck of dust from another. So researchers were working to make same-day infrared spectroscopy tests more accurate. Others were developing continuous, real-time silica monitoring tools. 
Mining researchers were also collaborating with the NIOSH chemistry team to understand exposures to silica in nano-clay, or particles of clay minerals. But the institute’s analytical chemists are all still facing layoffs. So are the researchers trying to address all the other hazards miners face. 
Federal mine safety and health research began in earnest in the 1910s, around the time Anita’s father was born. Back then, hundreds of coal miners died each year in mine explosions. 
NIOSH and its predecessors made those incidents rare. But mine risks keep evolving: As mines age, for example, massive sinkholes can appear, and institute researchers have been helping mine operators predict them. 
They are also studying ways to keep lithium batteries from exploding, working to understand if a growing number of natural gas wells could leak explosive methane into mines and devising ways to better prepare miners to survive accidents using virtual reality and to prevent accidents involving giant haul trucks. 
All of that work is now on pause. 
*   *   *
Wolfe hopes that the Department of Health and Human Services will restore NIOSH researchers voluntarily. A recent Health and Human Services draft budget for 2026 includes stable funding for mining research, even though researchers are not currently working.
In the meantime, the fate of their work could be determined by another court case, this one brought against the Trump administration by plaintiffs including Hoebbel’s union, the American Federation of Government Employees. 
It’s among several lawsuits that allege that by cutting funding and staff without authorization, the administration’s DOGE initiative has usurped the powers of Congress. 
Many institute layoffs were previously scheduled for June 2. But several days before, a judge issued an injunction putting the layoffs on pause until that case is adjudicated. The Trump administration has appealed that injunction to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
At issue is whether Congress has the right to commit to generational goals, like the health of miners, that require stability as executives come and go.
For Wolfe, the answer is obvious. “I always tell people: ‘I’m not gonna argue with you about whether coal is good or bad. But as long as it’s mined and there are coal miners, we need to take care of them.’”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding in fiscal year 2025, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments



But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In Colorado, 12.3 people died by gun suicide per 100,000 residents that year. In total, 27,300 people in the U.S. died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.

Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
In April, the Colorado governor signed into law Senate Bill 25-3, which sets training requirements to purchase most semiautomatic firearms.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.

Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
As USDA announces plans to repeal ‘roadless’ rule, ND has 250,000 acres that could be affected

Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Tony Evers delivers his 2025 state budget address. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers and Republican and Democratic legislative leaders have reached a tentative agreement on the 2025-27 state budget, agreeing to invest hundreds of millions in the University of Wisconsin system, to create new grant and payment programs for child care facilities, further boost investment in special education and cut $1.3 billion in taxes.
The deal comes after months of negotiations (and multiple breakdowns in communication) among Evers and Senate and Assembly leaders. Each leader highlighted pieces of the deal in statements.
Evers focused on the investments in education and child care, saying it is “a pro-kid budget that’s a win for Wisconsin’s kids, families, and our future.” 
“What was at stake is no secret — Republican lawmakers had long indicated this budget would not invest in child care providers, would provide no new increases for our K-12 schools, and would cut nearly $90 million from our UW System. But I never stopped believing we could work together to reach consensus and pass a bipartisan budget, and I’m proud of the months of work that went into getting to where we are today,” he said. 
Evers thanked Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) for coming to the table to get a deal done. 
“The people of Wisconsin expect their leaders to show up, work hard, and operate in good faith to get good things done,” Evers said. “We’ve shown we’ve been able to get good things done for Wisconsin when people put politics aside and decide to work together to do the right thing. I look forward to signing a bipartisan budget that makes these critical investments in our kids, families, and communities across our state,” Evers said. 
Evers has also agreed not to utilize his partial veto power — previous uses of which have been both limited and sustained by the state Supreme Court in recent weeks — on parts of the budget included in the deal.
Vos said in a statement that he appreciated Evers’ willingness to work with lawmakers to find a bipartisan agreement.
“This budget delivers on our two biggest priorities: tax relief for Wisconsin and reforms to make government more accountable,” Vos said. “This deal brings those investments and reforms together and creates a Wisconsin that works for everyone.” 
JFC co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said legislators worked hard to find compromise while staying “committed to our core principals.” 
“We are proud to have worked diligently to craft this budget, listened to the priorities of our constituents and look forward to sending the bill to [Evers] later this week,” Born said. 
LeMahieu and budget committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a statement that tax relief for middle-income Wisconsinites has been their top priority during the entire process.
“This compromise will provide meaningful tax relief for retirees and the middle class, stabilize the child care system without making pandemic-era subsidies permanent and strengthen our schools by reimbursing special education at a higher rate,” the Senate leaders said. 
Hesselbein  said she has “been at the table fighting hard on behalf of Senate Democrats to help hammer out a bipartisan budget agreement.” Her involvement in negotiations comes amid slim margins in the Senate. 
“Remember where we were a week ago: Republicans proposing $87 million in cuts to the UW, a mere 5% increase for special education and no direct payments to child care providers. Elections matter: the fact that Democrats gained four Senate seats and are close to taking the majority means that Senate Democrats were able to make this budget agreement better for the people of Wisconsin,” Hesselbein said.
Last session, the state Senate passed the budget bill with only Republican votes even after a couple of Republicans voted against the proposal. This session the Republican Senate caucus would only be able to lose one vote if it were going to pass the bill with only GOP support, yet, even prior to a deal announcement, a handful of Republican members had publicly expressed concerns about the spending in the bill. Among them was Sen. Steve Nass who, in a statement last week, laid out requirements for a budget that he could support, Sen. Rob Hutton who, in a Friday opinion piece, and Sen. Chris Kapenga who, in a post on Monday, drew their own lines in the sand.  
It is unclear how many Senate Democrats will vote for the budget when it comes to the floor this week. Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) earlier told WISN UpFront that the caucus was sticking together and members were “not willing to be picked off one by one.”
The Joint Finance Committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. Tuesday to vote on the rest of the budget before sending it to the full Assembly and Senate. 
Child care funding 
Child care providers, who have dealt with staffing shortages, high costs and declining state support, will receive a $300 million investment under the deal.
Evers had proposed spending an additional $480 million to continue funding Child Care Counts, a program that was funded using federal pandemic relief. With that funding running out, Evers had said the state should pick up the costs to continue supporting child care providers, while Republican lawmakers said they were opposed to providing checks to facilities.
Under the deal, the Child Care Counts program will be phased out, but the state will invest $110 million to support direct monthly payments and monthly per-child investments to child care facilities for a bridge program. That will continue helping providers to remain in business, cut child care wait lists and lower costs for families. The money will come out of the state’s federal interest earnings. 
The state will also invest $66 million in general purpose revenue for a “Get Kids Ready” initiative, which will be targeted at supporting child care providers serving 4-year-olds. This will be the first child care program in state history to be funded solely by general purpose revenue. 
Another agreed-upon budget item creates a $28.6 million pilot program to help support child care capacity for infants and toddlers. 
Under the program, providers are to receive $200 per month for every infant under 18 months and $100 per month for every toddler between 18 and 30 months.
Other child care investments include a $123 million increase in the Wisconsin Shares program, $2 million over the biennium for the creation of a competitive grant program aimed at supporting child care facilities seeking to expand their capacity and $2 million in Wisconsin’s Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies to help parents find child care and provide training to providers.
The deal also makes changes inspired by solutions that Republican lawmakers have advocated for including creating “large family care centers” that will be allowed to serve up to 12 children and standardizing the minimum age for an assistant teacher in a child care facility at 16. 
No cuts for University of Wisconsin system 
The University of Wisconsin system will get an investment of more than $256 million in the state budget under the deal — a significant compromise as Evers and the system had requested an $855 million investment, while Republican leaders in recent weeks were considering an $87 million cut to the system. Evers had threatened to veto the budget if it came to his desk with a cut. 
The funding includes $100 million to support UW system campuses statewide. Some of the funding would be distributed to campuses according to a formula. Of this, $15.25 million each year would be distributed to campuses with declining enrollment over the last two years and $11.25 million each year through a formula dependent on the number of credit hours undergraduates complete.
There will also be $7 million across the biennium to provide 24/7 virtual telehealth mental health services across UW system campuses, $54 million to support retainment and recruitment of faculty and staff, $94 million to increase wages by 3% in the first year and 2% in the second year for UW system employees and $1 million for UW-Green Bay’s Rising Phoenix Early College High School Program. 
The UW system will also be required to maintain the number of positions funded with general purpose revenue and program revenue at January 2024 levels. 
The system will also get over $840 million for capital projects. Other parts of the capital budget, including the Green Bay Correctional Institution, were addressed in the deal. 

$194 million for UW-La Crosse to complete the construction of the Prairie Springs Science Center and to demolish Crowley Hall 
$189 million for UW-Milwaukee to renovate the Health Sciences and Northwest Quadrant complex
$137 million for UW-Oshkosh to demolish a library facility, renovate and add a brand-new replacement addition 
$10 million for UW-Madison to renovate and build a new addition to Dejope Residence Hall 
$98 million for UW-Stevens Point to renovate and build a new addition to Sentry Hall
$800,000 for UW-Milwaukee to plan for renovations at Sandburg Hall East Tower 
Nearly $32 million for UW-Stout to renovate and build a new addition at its recreation complex
Nearly $19 million for UW-Madison to renovate the Chadbourne Residence Dining Hall, $5 million to plan for relocation and demolition of the UW-Madison Humanities Building and $160 million for renovation of UW-Madison’s Science Hall

K-12 special education funding up to 45% 
The deal also makes changes to the budget that Republican lawmakers on the budget committee passed in mid-June, boosting the special education reimbursement rate to 45% by the second year of the budget. 
The state’s special education rate was one of the crucial issues discussed by education advocates with many saying a significant investment would help alleviate some of the financial stress schools have faced and ease districts’ reliance on property taxes. 
Some advocates had called for a 90% investment, while Evers proposed a 60% rate. Republican lawmakers had initially approved raising the rate to 35% in the first year of the budget and 37.5% in the second year. 
Under the deal, the total investment in the special education reimbursement will be over $500 million. The rate will rise to 42% in the first half of the biennium and 45% in the second. It will remain at a sum certain rate, meaning the amount of money allocated is finite and will not increase based on expanding demand. 
The budget deal will also invest $30 million for comprehensive school-based mental health services.
Department of Health Services changes
The deal would also increase the hospital assessment rate to help maintain the state’s Medicaid costs. The Wisconsin Hospital Assessment is a levy from certain hospitals that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) uses to fund hospital access payments, hospital supplemental payments and reinvestment in the Wisconsin Medicaid program. 
Wisconsin hospitals currently pay an assessment rate of about 1.8% of their net patient revenue to the DHS. That would rise to 6% under the deal with 30% of the funds being retained in the Medical Assistance Trust Fund, which supports Wisconsin’s Medicaid program. The rest of the funds will be used to invest in hospital provider payments and is estimated to provide over $1.1 billion in additional investments in Wisconsin hospitals. 
The changes use federal funding to increase hospital reimbursement while decreasing the amount of general program revenue for the Medicaid program.
Evers’ office noted that federal reconciliation legislation proposals have included provisions that would prohibit or limit the policy change in the future, meaning that this budget could be the last for Wisconsin to make these types of changes.
The state will also fund the current Medicaid program under the deal. 
The budget will also increase investments in free and charitable clinics by $1.5 million.
The deal does not include Medicaid expansion, which Evers continued to advocate for in the budget but Republican leaders have fervently opposed. It also doesn’t include the smaller postpartum Medicaid extension, which would allow postpartum mothers to receive Medicaid coverage for up to a year after giving birth. 
Wisconsin is one of 10 states not to take the Medicaid expansion and one of two not to take the postpartum expansion. 
Roads improvement program gets additional investment 
A couple of projects created in the last budget to help with road improvement will get additional funding under the deal
The state will allocate $150 million in the Agricultural Roads Improvement Program, which was created in 2023 to support local agricultural road improvement projects statewide. Of the additional funding, $30 million will go towards improving and repairing deteriorating bridges across the state.
According to Evers’ office, the program has so far funded 92 projects across the state. 
The deal would also generate nearly $200 million in additional revenue to improve the sustainability of the transportation fund, allocate $14 million for municipal service payments, invest $50 million to continue the Local Projects Program (also created in the 2023 budget), which supports local communities with construction projects that serve statewide public purpose, allocate $15 million for repairs and modifications to the Echo Lake Dam, invest $5 million for the Browns Lake dredging project and invest $30 million for the De Pere railroad bridge.
$1.3 billion in tax cuts
Evers has also agreed to support the tax cuts that lawmakers approved in committee in mid-June. 
Under those changes, more people will qualify for the state’s second tax bracket with a rate of 4.4%. For single filers, the qualifying maximum income will increase from $29,370 to $50,480. For joint filers, the maximum will increase from $39,150 to $67,300 and for married separate filers, the maximum will increase from $19,580 to $33,650.
It’s estimated that this will reduce the state’s revenues by $323 million in 2025-26 and $320 million in 2026-27.
The cut will affect 1.6 million Wisconsin taxpayers and provide an average cut of $180. Under Wisconsin’s tax system, people pay the first-bracket tax rate on the portion of their income that falls into that bracket, the second-bracket rate on their income up to the maximum of the second bracket and so on. Thus even high-income earners will get a tax break through adjustments to the lower bracket rates.
The proposal also included an income tax exclusion for retirees. It is estimated to reduce Wisconsin’s revenues by $395 million in 2025-26 and $300 million in 2026-27. This will allow Wisconsinites 67 and older to exclude up to $24,000 for single-filers and $48,000 for married-joint filers of retirement income payments. Those filers will see an average cut of about $1,000 per filer.
The deal will also include the elimination of the sales tax on household utility bills, which is estimated to cost the state about $178 million over the biennium and create a film tax credit similar to one that Republican lawmakers have been advocating for.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Maryland on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks.
That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
Last Friday’s ruling allows Trump’s birthright citizenship order to take effect in the 28 states, including South Carolina, that were not part of the initial lawsuits challenging it.
The Supreme Court ruled that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
How rights and citizenship under the 14th Amendment were tested in SC

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So, attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday with a complaint involving 15 women who live in nine states, including South Carolina.
They seek to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states: Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington.
Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.
The pregnant woman in South Carolina, identified as “Monica,” is due in August. She and her husband are from Venezuela, living in the United States since 2019. Both have temporary protected status. She is a medical doctor seeking to validate her medical degree in the United States, according to the court filing.
“If her child is not given U.S. citizenship, Monica fears her child will be stateless, without rights in this country or any other,” it reads. “Although Monica and her husband are excited to welcome their baby into the world, they are also filled with uncertainty and fear over what status their child will have.”

Jay Reedy confirmed he is running for the 7th Congressional District seat set to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Mark Green.
Reedy, an Erin Republican, said he filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to enter the election and could announce his candidacy this week.
Green is planning to leave the post after voting on President Donald Trump’s spending plan, creating an opening for a host of candidates in a special election to be scheduled this year. 
Reedy is the latest Republican to say he will run for the seat, a position he said he wants to fill in an effort to cut federal bureaucracy and support Trump’s policies. Reedy testified for federal prosecutors in the April political corruption trial against former House Speaker Glen Casada and his top aide, Cade Cothren, who were convicted on nearly 20 counts of conspiracy, fraud and kickbacks.
In his sixth two-year House term, Reedy said he has been bothered by the federal government’s slow reaction to flood damage in Waverly in August 2021 where 20 people died and the community lost two school buildings. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $20 million to replace the schools, but FEMA required Waverly to resubmit paperwork, delaying work on the projects.
In addition, Reedy said the U.S. Department of Education should be eliminated because of its expense, roughly $268 billion, about $2.6 billion of which is sent to Tennessee. He also questioned environmental enforcement on farmland across the state.
“The federal government needs to stay out of Tennessee’s business,” Reedy said, adding he signed numerous lawsuits against the Obama and Biden administrations.
Other Republican candidates for the post are former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, and Springfield resident Jon Thorpe and Jason Knight of Clarksville.
Van Epps recently announced his leadership team with car dealership magnate Lee Beaman and his wife, Julie, serving as honorary co-chairs. Alex Joyner, who managed Green’s re-election campaigns in 2022 and 2024, will serve as campaign manager, and Rachel Barrett, another Green staffer, will lead finance operations. 
No Democratic candidates have announced yet they will run.

The owners of a Memphis-based health clinic MedPartners and SarJo Pharmacy purported to treat injured United States Postal Service employees, billing the cost of medications to the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA), according to an indictment filed June 12.
But the medication was never prescribed to patients, and the majority of the medications were not carried in stock by the pharmacy. About 500 of the 4,052 claims billed by SarJo Pharmacy between August 2018 and August 2021 were for drugs that were never actually manufactured or available to be purchased, the indictment states.
Collierville residents Kossie Lamon Simmons, 59, and Katina Marzie Simmons, 48, face charges of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, alongside 47-year-old Memphis resident Tritia Margalizita Townsend, who served as SarJo Pharmacy’s pharmacist in charge.
Between August 2018 and December 2021, FECA paid the pharmacy about $16.3 million. 
“Kossie, Katina and Townsend personally profited from their participation in the scheme by receiving fraud proceeds for the personal use and benefit of themselves and others,” the indictment states.
The trio are among 324 defendants facing charges as part of the U.S. Department of Justice’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, according to Interim U.S. Attorney Joseph C. Murphy, Jr. The operation targeted those with alleged involvement in health care fraud and illegal drug diversion schemes throughout the United States. 
Indictment details alleged scheme
Kossie Simmons controlled and managed MedPartners, a health clinic founded in 2016 with locations in Memphis, Nashville, and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to the indictment filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. Kossie Simmons also controlled and managed SarJo Pharmacy, which was founded in 2018 and had one location in Memphis. 
Katina Simmons managed and held 70% ownership interest in both companies. 
The indictment mentions an unnamed co-conspirator that held 30% ownership interest in both companies. Kossie Simmons, who previously pleaded guilty to health care fraud in 2007 and was barred from participating in any federal health care program for 25 years, exchanged text messages with the co-conspirator in August 2016.
“Been patiently waiting for the planets to come back into alignment from my first go round, now can attack this opportunity with the most valuable weapon of all EXPERIENCE,” Kossie Simmons wrote in one text message, according to the indictment. 
Katina Simmons enrolled MedPartners as a billing agent for the FECA program in August 2016, and enrolled the clinic as a physician office in the program in 2017, though Kossie Simmons was specifically barred from participating in a federal health care program.
SarJo Pharmacy opened in 2018 with Townsend as the only employed pharmacist. Townsend worked one day each week for four hours filling prescriptions for lidocaine and diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat pain, the indictment states.
The Tennessee Board of Pharmacy began investigating the business in September 2020 and discovered the pharmacy was billing for prescription medications without valid prescription orders. Instead, two nurse practitioners who worked in MedPartners’ clinics would determine whether patients were eligible for compounded medications, or medicines created using drug ingredients “tailored to the needs of an individual patient,” according to the indictment.
Two other physicians who worked with MedPartners never authorized prescriptions for the medications billed, and the nurse practitioners did not have access to prescription pads, according to court documents.
Investigators executed search warrants on the businesses in August 2021. The businesses submitted 227 more claims between the searches and the end of that year, bringing in another $1.1 million in payments.
Kossie and Katina Simmons each face one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, which carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, if convicted. They also face seven counts of health care fraud, which carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, if convicted. 
Townsend faces one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud and three counts of health care fraud.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed the state’s massive operating budget, which includes funding for a new Cleveland Browns domed stadium and provides tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is a developing story and will be updated. The governor will have a press conference at 10 a.m. Tuesday on his decisions.
At 11:15 p.m. Monday, DeWine announced he approved the about $60-billion Republican spending bill. As of 1:30 a.m., he was only midway through scanning his 67 line-item vetoes, spokesperson Dan Tierney said.
So far, we know several items approved in the budget.
The Browns will be getting $600 million for their new Brook Park stadium.
The budget calls for the state to take legal ownership of $1.7 billion in unclaimed funds, setting a clock on how long people have to file claims and get reunited with their missing money.
That’s a major change for Ohio, which currently holds unclaimed funds in perpetuity. The budget will give people a decade to claim their money before it becomes the state’s property. Lawmakers want to grab $1.7 billion out of Ohio’s $4.8 billion pool of unclaimed funds right away — and then continue taking money on a rolling basis, after a decade of holding it.
The budget also changes a state law designed to make it harder for pro sports teams to leave publicly subsidized facilities, clearing a significant obstacle from the Browns’ road to Brook Park.
The new language says the so-called Modell law, designed to prevent major sports teams from pulling up stakes, would only come into play if a team chose to leave the state.
The changes to the law are likely to end a court battle that’s just getting started and take leverage away from the City of Cleveland, which is fighting to keep the Browns on the lakefront or negotiate a better exit deal if the team leaves.
Income tax
He also approved the GOP’s 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. This was made up by cutting social services and some tax exemptions.
Medicaid
Tierney confirmed that some aspects of the Medicaid cuts, ones that were set to cut about 800,000 Ohioans off of health care, have been signed into law. Other provisions were vetoed, he said.

Thom Tillis (R-NC) listens during a Senate Judiciary Hearing on June 18, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)From the beginning of his tenure in the North Carolina General Assembly, it’s always been evident that Thom Tillis was not a true right-wing, authoritarian extremist.
Arch-conservative – especially on matters of taxes and economic policy? Yes. Ready to pare the social safety net to the bone and “divide and conquer” the various groups of people who find themselves relying upon it to maintain a semblance of economic security? Certainly. Happy to ram through a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage while forecasting that its demise was inevitable? Sure. Willing to swallow his pride and abandon basic personal values on a regular basis in order to assuage an above average case of political ambition? Absolutely.
But a genuine, dyed-in-the-wool, Trump and Putin-loving, immigrant-hating, LGBTQ-bashing, white/Christian nationalist MAGA-believer? No way.
Like a lot of modern conservative Republicans, Tillis has certainly blown with the winds that overtook his party the last couple of decades. And he’s probably embraced a number of positions and policies that he would have found surprising back in his early 40’s, when he commenced his political career by running for a local park board position in order to champion a public bike path.
But as he made clear on multiple occasions while serving in the North Carolina House and during his 10-plus years in Washington, Tillis’s political values and instincts were and are much more in line with the rapidly withering Bush/McCain/Romney branch of Republicanism than the Trump-as-flawless-Dear-Leader cult. While he regularly caved in to the demands of the bully-in-chief and his hench-people (on immigration, on foreign policy, on advancing unqualified buffoons to court seats and cabinet positions), you knew they were always moves of calculated – some would say cowardly — political expedience. The Trump people knew this too and clearly never trusted him.
This past weekend, Tillis finally reached his limit. Faced with voting for one of the most monstrously destructive legislative proposals in American history — a bill that will wreak havoc on his state and further empower a man who openly aspires to become a national dictator – Tillis made clear there was a limit to how far down the Trump cult rabbit hole he was ultimately willing be dragged. By voting against the president’s disastrous mega-bill and then quickly announcing his decision not to seek reelection next year, Tillis appears to have taken a big step in officially severing ties with the sect and recapturing a small sense of who he is and what he believes as he contemplates his final 18 months in office.
Of course, as mental health experts will attest, leaving a cult — like overcoming an addiction — can be a complicated, up-and-down process. This is especially true for disillusioned former true believers.
Fortunately, in this case, Tillis’s departure seems more akin to that of someone who knew all along that they needed to get away from a controlling and abusive leader, but just hated the thought of being ostracized by the community they so long inhabited and the ideals that many members of the group still nominally professed – not to mention giving up a position of political power.
But as other Republicans like former Congresswoman Liz Cheney have discovered, there can be life beyond the cult. What’s more, and this is important, unlike Cheney whose time in Congress almost immediately ended after she bravely dared to cross Trump, Tillis is now a free man with a full year-and-a-half left in office to do and say what he believes, and maybe just maybe, to convince other disaffected Republican lawmakers who know the emperor is naked to, at least occasionally, join him.
Indeed, with partisan margins so razor thin on Capitol Hill, Tillis now has the opportunity to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina since Sam Ervin helped spearhead the demise of Richard Nixon a half-century ago.
For instance, as University of Richmond law professor and judiciary watcher Carl Tobias told NC Newsline Sunday, now that he’s free from reelection concerns, Tillis is well-positioned to stymie some of Trump’s looniest court nominees from advancing in the Senate Judiciary Committee – a body in which the GOP holds only a 12-10 advantage.
If only Tillis had had his epiphany before caving on the execrable nomination of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary.
Could all of this be wishful thinking? Maybe.
Blood runs thick and Tillis has already taken to social media to say that he wants a Republican to win his seat next year. But given the state of the North Carolina GOP, that will ultimately mean supporting a craven Trump toady who will be commanded to specifically condemn Tillis, so who knows how enthusiastically he’ll stick to that stance?
Whatever the state of Senator Tillis’s psyche at what is no doubt a difficult personal moment, he’s clearly come to a fork in the road on the overriding issue of our times: Trumpism. In one direction lies the rocky path of strength, honor, morality and making an important difference for the nation’s future that would be long remembered. Down the other lies the path of acquiescence, personal ease and comfort, and utter political and historical irrelevance.

At right is a copy by Mary Katherine Goddard printing, 1777. (Rhode Island State Archives)Honor the history behind Independence Day with a visit to the Rhode Island State Archives for a once-a-year showing of the state’s trio of copies of the Declaration of Independence.
The special holiday display will be open for visitors from 9 a.m. to noon on Friday, July 4, at the State Archives on Broad Street in Providence, Secretary of State Gregg Amore announced in a statement on Monday. 
“The State Archives are the keepers of three beautifully-preserved pieces of American history – Rhode Island’s copies of the Declaration of Independence,” Amore said in a statement. “I hope Rhode Islanders and visitors alike will take advantage of this opportunity to see our history up close.”
The event marks the only day of the year that all three documents will be publicly displayed in the state archives. During the rest of the year, the public can view the copies by making an appointment with archives staff, who can retrieve the documents from their storage space.
This year’s display also features a new, banner exhibit explaining the background of each of the copies of the country’s founding document. 
The oldest of the trio, the Southwick Printing, is one of roughly 200 copies printed in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, immediately following the approval by Congress that same day. Then-Gov. Nicholas Cooke received Rhode Island’s copy two days later, according to the Department of State. A local printer for the Newport Mercury, Solomon Southwick, was also paid to reproduce the document to give to the state’s town clerks.
Six months later, in January 1777, a second printing of the Declaration was authorized through Connecticut printer Mary Goddard. Unlike the prior iteration, the second round publicly identified the names of each document signatory. A third, stone engraving of the same document was ordered in 1823, with 200 printings shared with surviving signers, government officials and departments, and higher education institutions.
Also part of the state’s July 4 exhibit: a newly authorized portrait reproduction of the First Rhode Island Regiment, a group of 130 Black soldiers who joined the Continental Army in 1778, and were immediately freed upon enlistment. The formation of the regiment marked the first and only time a state government offered freedom in exchange for service during the Revolutionary War, according to the Secretary of State’s office.  
The original “Brave Men as Ever Fought” portrait by Don Troiani was displayed at the Rhode Island State House from March to June, but is now en route back to its home at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. The state’s authorized copy will be traveling to various locations throughout the state in 2026, including the State House, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office, said in an email.
The State Archives houses more than 10 million letters, photographs and other important state documents in its home at 33 Broad St. in Providence. More information is available online at https://www.sos.ri.gov/divisions/state-archives.

Kelly Ayotte legalizes high stakes tournaments and slot machines such as these shown at a casino in Tampa, Florida. (Photo by Octavio Jones/Getty Images)The two budget bills signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte Friday are sprawling — House Bill 2, the policy bills, has 162 pages of new laws. And many of the budget’s changes have already graced headlines, inspired protests, and set off debates in State House committees. 
Observers may know about the budget’s “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban for K-12 students, the end to New Hampshire’s yearly auto inspections mandate in January 2026, or the premiums added to Medicaid recipients that would charge $90 per month for a household of three. 
Other provisions,  however, may have fallen through the cracks. Here are eight changes in the budget that you might not have heard about.
Medicaid changes
In addition to the new premiums, the budget includes other changes to New Hampshire’s Medicaid program that will affect who can participate.
To start, it includes a renewed push for a work requirement. House Bill 2 requires that the Department of Health and Human Services apply for a waiver to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in order to impose a work requirement. 
That waiver application must first be approved by the state’s Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee — a powerful panel of senators and representatives — before DHHS can send it to the federal agency. Then, if the Trump administration approves, New Hampshire’s work requirement will take effect.
The budget also fully restores the income verification process for Medicaid that had been in effect before COVID-19. Those verifications, which required participants to provide annual income verification, were suspended from 2020 to 2023.
And it directs DHHS to apply for a federal waiver to increase the prescription drug copay for Medicaid recipients to $4. 
Aside from the cost and eligibility changes, the budget also directs Medicaid to pay for new services.
It allows the state to include name-brand drugs on its preferred drug list for Medicaid participants, allowing the program to pay for name-brand medication in the rare cases that it is cheaper than generic equivalents.
It instructs state officials to use Medicaid funds to “accelerate the implementation” of the state’s at-home dialysis program.
And it tells the state to implement an incentive program to encourage beneficiaries to receive outpatient procedures, such as ambulatory care, in a “lower cost” setting.
The “Momnibus 2.0” bill
The budget delivered one victory for health care advocates by including a bill known as “Momnibus 2.0.” The bill seeks to improve maternal health by targeting maternal depression and common health problems that follow giving birth. 
The goal: to reduce the prevalence of deaths of new mothers caused by postpartum substance use disorder and mental health crises.
Momnibus 2.0 requires health insurers in New Hampshire, including Medicaid, to cover maternal mental health screenings during well-child visits after pregnancy. Those screenings would occur at the child’s 1-month, 2-month, 4-month and 6-month check-ups.
The bill requires insurance and Medicaid to cover home visiting services for pregnant and postpartum women. It also mandates that employers provide those people at least 25 hours of leave from work in the first year of the child’s life to attend such appointments. And it sets up and funds a state psychiatric hotline for pregnant and postpartum women, beginning in July 2027. 
Betting and gambling changes
Throughout the budget, there are some provisions that expand gambling and betting in the state. But there are also portions that seek to help mitigate its effects.
For instance, the budget legalizes both video lottery terminals and high-stakes tournaments, a move that has provided a key revenue source for the rest of the budget. 
Video lottery terminals are machines that allow players to wager cash, credits, vouchers or tokens for games of chance, such as digital slot machines. And high-stakes tournaments are games of chance in which the required buy-in is $2,500 or more. The latter may be used by licensed operators under the state’s charitable gaming law. 
The expansion has prompted lawmakers to grow the scope of the agency overseeing these games: Under the budget, the New Hampshire Lottery Commission will be renamed to New Hampshire Lottery and Gaming Commission, and will oversee the new games.
At the same time, the budget includes some provisions designed to address gambling addiction. It directs the Lottery and Gaming Commission to contract with an organization to create a “voluntary statewide self-exclusion database.” That would allow people to choose to bar themselves from all forms of legal gambling in the state; the budget directs the commission to design specific rules for how it would work.
A fix for special education funding
After New Hampshire’s state special education fund ran out of money in 2024, prompting Department of Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut to warn schools about potential cost increases, lawmakers have been attempting to prevent future shortfalls.
One example can be seen in House Bill 2. The budget bill holds that if the special education fund falls short of fully funding the amount that school districts are owed, the fund will be required to fund at least 80% of what school districts were owed. The budget also empowers the governor to request additional money from the general fund to fill that special education fund and meet that 80% requirement. 
But not all special education funding fixes were added. During the budget writing process, the Senate took out an increase in per-pupil state funding for public school students receiving special education that had been passed by the House, drawing criticism from some advocates.

A state film agency?
New Hampshire has been the backdrop to a handful of successful movies, including the 1995 Robin Williams movie “Jumanji” to the 1981 Katherine Hepburn film “On Golden Pond.” Some lawmakers are interested in bringing the state further onto the silver screen. 
Currently, the New Hampshire’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs runs a web page with resources for studios looking to film in the state. That website includes information on how to obtain a permit to film on local roads and highways, how to shoot in the White Mountain National Forest, and how to connect to location scouts for specific needs.
But the budget would contemplate whether to create an entire office dedicated to film and creative media — as well as whether to pass a tax credit to incentivize more films to be set here. House Bill 2 requires that a panel of one senator and two representatives meet between now and Nov. 1 to produce recommendations.
A number of states have passed similar tax credits or enticements, such as Georgia, New Mexico, Illinois, New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey and California. 
Court-appointed attorneys for involuntary admissions hearings
House Bill 2 increases the state’s obligation to provide legal counsel to people who are fighting their involuntary commitments to hospitals and psychiatric facilities. 
Previously, state law held that a person being involuntary committed is entitled to an attorney to represent them in a hearing to overturn that commitment, and may be provided a public defender if they are unable to pay for one.
The budget updates that language to require the state to provide an attorney for anyone who is in that position and does not have a lawyer, regardless of whether they can pay for it. And it states that the funds for those attorneys — as well as any investigators or experts needed to help with that person’s case — should be paid for out of the state’s indigent defense fund. 
Year-round emergency services for substance abuse
Included in the budget is $10 million over the next two years that will allow DHHS to provide year-round emergency shelter to people suffering from opioid use disorder. That money will come from the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund, which contains money the state won in settlements against opioid producers such as Purdue Pharma. 
Mobile driver’s licenses
House Bill 2 instructs the Division of Motor Vehicles to create a mobile driver’s license in New Hampshire. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, the agency will begin offering the “electronic credentials” to those who have attained physical driver’s licenses; it will also set a fee for them. 
Even with the new credentials, a driver will still need to have their physical license on their person while driving a vehicle, the statute clarifies. But the mobile licenses could potentially be used to verify identity or age in other environments, such as bars. 
The budget also requires the DMV to begin offering non-driver’s identification cards to residents who qualify.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)University of Virginia president Jim Ryan’s abrupt resignation in the midst of federal pressure on the school to end its DEI initiatives set off a firestorm of controversy, with Virginia Democratic lawmakers now pledging that they will find ways to prevent further politicization of higher education. The lawmakers said they’re reconsidering legislation to support governing boards and reevaluating the gubernatorial appointments process.
UVA President Jim Ryan resigns amid federal ultimatum

Democratic legislators started speaking against the impetus of Ryan’s resignation soon after he announced the news Friday.
“It’s just outrageous,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville. “I don’t know that this sort of thing has ever happened before, where the federal government has reached down, totally around the governing structure that a sovereign state has set up for governance of its universities, and has forced this sort of change.”

On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell said his colleagues are exploring all options to navigate what they framed as questionable higher education decisions made by President Donald Trump, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and their administrations, including reviewing the governor’s multiple appointments to college governing boards.
“We’ve been getting calls to stand up from people all around the commonwealth, and we have to look at these people very carefully and decide where to confirm them,” Surovell said. “When we come back in January, reform is going to be on the table, because we cannot afford to ever let this happen again,” Surrovell added, in reference to the upcoming legislative session.
The New York Times first reported that the Department of Justice claimed that UVA had merely rebranded its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts instead of eliminating them as mandated by Trump’s executive order, which warned of federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
UVA’s governing board was the first in the commonwealth to dissolve its DEI initiatives and Virginia’s efforts to challenge DEI efforts ramped up under the Youngkin administration.. 
In January 2022, Youngkin renamed the state Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion through an executive order by replacing“equity” with “opportunity,” contrary to state code. Then in April 2023, Martin Brown, the office director appointed by Youngkin, remarked that “DEI is dead” at the Virginia Military Institute.
“Let’s take a moment right now to kill that cow. DEI is dead,” Brown said. “We’re not going to bring that cow up anymore. It’s dead. It was mandated by the General Assembly, but this governor has a different philosophy of civil discourse, civility … living the golden rule, right?”
In January 2022, the governor also eliminated DEI-driven education programs at the Virginia Department of Education through an executive order by striking down “divisive concepts” in school curriculum.
Ryan’s resignation marked an unprecedented development for university leaders, a coalition of whom condemned the “Trump administration’s political pressure campaign” leading to Ryan’s exit.
“We view this campaign as an egregious attack on the independence and integrity of public higher education in Virginia,” Timothy Gibson, president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said in a statement Monday.
Also on Monday, Ross Mugler, acting president & CEO of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges and a governing board member at Old Dominion University, said in a statement that the incident at UVA is not an isolated one; but a growing threat for all institutions.
“Governing boards and institutional leaders across the country must treat this moment as a wake-up call,” Mugler wrote. “Now is the time to reaffirm your board’s unwavering commitment to institutional autonomy, academic freedom and governance integrity. Boards must stand united with their presidents in the face of politicization, external interference, and efforts to erode public trust.”
In a letter to the UVA community on Friday, Ryan wrote that his resignation was “an excruciatingly difficult decision, and I am heartbroken to be leaving this way.” 
 Response from Republicans

Republican leaders have largely stayed quiet following Ryan’s resignation, except for John Reid, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor.
“Good. That’s what happens when you stick your middle finger up at the elected governor and the voters of Virginia and then play a game of chicken with the president of the United States on an issue that’s overtly reverse racist like DEI,” Reid wrote on social media Saturday.
He also claimed that Ryan has “presided over the decline of the honor system” at the institution.
“The great University of Virginia deserves leadership that will help it to regain its reputation as a place of high personal standards and robust intellectual curiosity and debate instead of a standard issue incubator of biased and emotional anti-American thought,” he wrote, warning other university leaders to take note that “DEI is dead” and they “better start being honest and fair with students and taxpayers if you want to keep your job.”

Ryan had faced recent criticism about his leadership and calls for him to step down from some segments of the UVA community.
On May 15, the Jefferson Council, a UVA alumni organization, urged UVA’s Board of Visitors to find new leadership at the institution, taking out a full-page advertisement in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 
“The damage to UVA’s values and traditions is not theoretical—it is palpable and measurable, and is the result of leadership that has failed the entire University community,” said Joel Gardner, president of The Jefferson Council, in a May 15 statement.
The advertisement alleged there were multiple leadership failures under Ryan’s tenure, which “undermined the University’s integrity and founding ideals.”
The council said a deadly shooting in 2022 that took the lives of three students and wounded two others was mishandled under Ryan’s watch, and that his administration enabled the “worst outbreak of antisemitism” in UVA’s history. 
However, Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, refuted the Jefferson Council’s claims in a public letter, saying the alumni group compromises the institution’s leadership and reputation through partisan attacks.
“They say they want to restore Jefferson’s vision, but their approach undermines the very ideals of free inquiry, reasoned debate, and honor that Jefferson championed. Their tactics — lies, personal attacks, and public disrespect — stand in direct opposition to the honor code and the values that define UVA,” the group wrote. “We want to set the record straight: UVA is thriving — and the overwhelming majority of alumni are proud of the progress being made under President Ryan’s leadership.”
 Looking ahead

Senate Democrats have fought against Youngkin’s influence over governing boards at Virginia’s institutions by rejecting some of his appointments from confirmation. However, the governor’s administration contends that until the General Assembly confirms the appointments in January, they can still serve.
Democrats are now challenging that in court, in a case they hope will determine if leaders at three of Virginia’s universities broke the rules by allowing rejected appointees to remain in their governing boards.
The lawsuit targets the leadership of the Virginia Military Institute, the University of Virginia and George Mason University.
Surovell said the Senate may also reconsider a proposal from last year’s session that Youngkin vetoed, which would have redefined the authority of governing boards within public universities regarding their legal affairs. The proposal would have given the boards the authority to manage independent legal counsel. It also clarified that the state attorney general’s involvement in legal matters would be limited to instances where their services are specifically requested.
Deeds said another idea would be to amend the state code, which specifies that gubernatorial appointments cannot take effect until they are confirmed by the General Assembly, typically in January. Currently, once the governor agrees, a gubernatorial appointment can be allowed to serve immediately on boards including on governing boards at Virginia’s higher education institutions.

Recently, the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee was permitted to take up the appointments because lawmakers have not recessed from the 2024 Special Session.
Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, said one of the areas lawmakers need to work on is ensuring the confirmation process for gubernatorial appointments is transparent and people understand how it works. She said even some of the new and seasoned legislators are uncertain of the process. 
“I think there absolutely can be ways to clarify so that we don’t have to take legal action in the future if someone does not step out of the role,” Callsen said.
Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, said she plans to introduce a legislative proposal that would require all public colleges and universities to elect nonvoting faculty and staff representatives to their boards. Most institutions allow nonvoting faculty representatives; the proposed bill would make it a requirement.
Lawmakers and supporters have advocated for similar efforts to give faculty and staff a voice in decision-making, aiming to improve policies on retention, recruitment, and overall workplace confidence.
The proposal has died in back-to-back sessions. Youngkin vetoed the bill in 2024, citing cost concerns and a lack of oversight. Deeds’ similarly unsuccessful proposal in 2023 focused solely on the University of Virginia’s governing board.
“I think it’s a great way to get more opinions and actual people that are interacting on the campus, to have their voices at the Board of Visitors,” Laufer said. “I think it’s crucial.”
Democratic lawmakers also haven’t ruled out the possibility of taking legal action against the federal government, as public concerns mount in the wake of Ryan’s resignation.
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, called for a stand against the Trump administration’s attempts to interfere in Virginia’s higher education landscape, which she said are exemplified by threats to take federal funds from universities and leaders who don’t align with the administration’s educational ideology.
“They do not want an informed citizenry. They want folks to learn what they want them to learn, and in doing so, they are again undermining civil rights, civil liberties and higher education, because the fear is — as it was in antebellum days (by) not teaching slaves how to read and write — that if you have an informed citizenry, then one will begin to question and raise questions.”

It was an outcome of congressional legislation that passed with bipartisan support, based on the recognition that medicine alone isn’t adequate for people living with a serious medical condition if their other needs aren’t met. The program is implemented in the commonwealth with its grant funding distributed to various organizations by the Virginia Department of Health.
If someone can’t afford food or housing, or doesn’t have transportation, he or she will have difficulty accessing necessary medical care. If someone with HIV has another medical issue that goes untreated, he or she will be more vulnerable to the virus. These are issues the Ryan White Program was designed to help patients navigate.
As of 2022, there were about 25,000 people living with HIV in Virginia. Community organizations funded through the Ryan White Program serve a significant number of these individuals. Part of the reason why the amount of people living with HIV in Virginia isn’t larger is due to the success of these organizations in testing, treatment, and support. 
Despite a long track record of success, the Ryan White funding allocated to community organizations is being severely undercut across Virginia, and it doesn’t seem to be entirely due to DOGE (or the “Department of Government Efficiency”) at the federal level. These cuts are a first test in how the Virginia state government may respond if Congress reduces access to the Affordable Care Act and eliminates Medicaid benefits for tens of thousands of low-income state residents. In a word: shamefully.
In the Hampton Roads region, Minority Aids Support Services recently lost $500,000 in funding to support individuals with HIV/AIDS. In Richmond, Nationz Foundation lost almost half of its funding, and the Capital Area Health Network lost all of its Ryan White program money to provide comprehensive care to individuals with HIV/AIDS, and was subsequently forced to close its wellness program.
Fredericksburg Area Health and Support Services (FAHASS) — which serves a region stretching from from the Blue Ridge to the Northern Neck — experienced an $850,000 funding cut. This translated to the loss of six professionals and broad cuts to important services that were previously provided to individuals with HIV. The discontinued programs include: rental and housing assistance, mental health services for the uninsured, financial support for non-HIV prescription medicine, dental health services and medical transportation.
Taken together as part of a holistic program, these were life-saving services that will be much less accessible for many low-income individuals with HIV. Stacy Wells, CEO of the LGBT Life Center in Norfolk put it this way: “The reality is after the 25 years we’ve been building these programs, they’ve now been dismantled in just months.” 
It’s uncertain why these cuts were made. Ryan White funding is allocated by the federal government to states, which then distributes the money to local care providers. While the federal government under the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce funding for health and human services in other areas, news stories across Virginia indicate that these recent cuts  were the outcome, at least at some level, of decisions made within state government.
I emailed a Virginia Department of Health spokesperson three weeks ago with a request for more information about the genesis and rationale for the funding cuts, and to learn more about the scope of Ryan White funding reductions across the commonwealth. Despite following up several times and receiving assurances that the information would be coming, I have not yet received it.
‘Care is resistance.’ Va. free health clinics strategize survival after state, federal funding cuts

For now, it is an open question about why the service providers that care for some of Virginia’s most vulnerable residents are being targeted for budget cuts, especially in a year when the state’s total revenue is more than $200 million dollars over earlier projections.
Maybe low-income people are an easy target? Members of Congress certainly seem to think so as they contemplate measures to reduce access to the Affordable Care Act and add new requirements and restrictions that will cut medical assistance to millions of Americans on Medicaid. 
How will our state respond if these cuts are enacted? Will state leaders fight to preserve healthcare access? Will they act with compassion to help those losing the treatments and services that they depend on? The current cuts to HIV/AIDS programs across the commonwealth, happening in a year with a budget surplus, do not bode well. 
These cuts have real-life impacts. People will lose access to medical care. Lives will become more difficult, and some lives will be lost prematurely. We are at risk of becoming a more harsh and uncaring society.
It doesn’t need to be this way. Virginia can stand up for its residents and ensure that everyone has access to the lifesaving medical care and support that they deserve. A good place to start would be by restoring funding to the community organizations across the commonwealth that serve individuals with HIV/AIDS.

Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions, including one from Pennsylvania, have asked a Rhode Island federal judge to halt the Trump administration’s new restrictions for grants administered by an office within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Violence Against Women Act.
The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence is part of the suit.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.

“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request.
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.

Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.
$1 million in grants awarded to Rhode Island annually
The Rhode Island Coalition has an annual budget of roughly $5.3 million, of which approximately $3.4 million is passed through to member agencies. Roughly $1 million of that comes from Office on Violence Against Women grants, the coalition’s executive director, Lucy Rios, stated in an affidavit.
Federal grants and contracts accounted for 79% of the coalition’s revenue, according to its annual report.
The coalition has received grant funding in various program categories every year since at least 2001. It has sought training and technical assistance grants and other competitive discretionary grants, including $114,533 awarded for the period Oct. 1, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025. The lawsuit was filed ahead of a June 25 deadline to apply for a fiscal 2025 training and technical assistance grant that was anticipated in the amount of $113,574.
Rhode Island received $550,000 from the OVW in 2022 to create a safe visitation and exchange program for domestic violence survivors and their children — along with LGBTQ-related advocacy. The coalition also received a $350,000 grant to educate young men — particularly youth of color and immigrant communities — on the crimes of domestic and dating violence.
The coalition sought to continue the programs with additional grant funding, along with $900,000 to be used toward identifying potential high-risk cases for supervision and monitoring, according to the affidavit.
“Without access to this funding, vital programs that keep Rhode Islanders safe and keep our state at the forefront of addressing domestic violence are at risk, including RI’s first Safe Exchange and Supervised Visitation Center for families experiencing domestic violence,” Rios said in a June 16 statement. “We strive to be as courageous and resilient as the survivors in our communities as we stand up to protect the safety net for victims and infrastructure for prevention that we have been collectively building for nearly 50 years.”
A spokesperson for the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The group of state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions includes the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence; California Partnership to End Domestic Violence; Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault; DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence; End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin: The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence; Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence; Jane Doe Inc.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– – Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.











We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics



The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

Ned Lamont last week vetoed House Bill 5002, which was the most significant piece of housing legislation to cross his desk since he became governor in 2019. 
Lawmakers will now spend the coming weeks reworking the housing omnibus bill, with negotiations likely focused on changes to policies that mandate towns to plan for more housing, changes to parking requirements and potentially reviving a measure dropped during the session that would tie school construction money to affordable housing.
Lamont vetoed the bill, which his staff negotiated, amid objections from some groups largely centering around provisions on parking reform and a requirement for towns to plan and zone for a set number of units. Opponents feared the bill would dilute local control and put unrealistic expectations on towns for building more housing.
Now, lawmakers are pushing forward with more negotiations on the bill ahead of a special session that will likely be held either next month or in the fall. Democratic leadership said they’re focused on preserving as much of the bill as possible, and Senate Democrats have additional measures they want to add into the omnibus bill.
“I think we can make it better. I think the only way to really make it work is if you have buy-in from the local communities,” Lamont said last week.
[RELATED: What to know about H.B. 5002, the omnibus housing bill]
Democrats responded with disappointment and frustration about the decision, but said they were pushing forward with crafting the best possible bill.
“All the politics of the last couple of weeks I’m less concerned with and remain focused on the actual outcome, which is housing for people and families,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
“Housing remains a huge issue for so many people, and to do nothing lets many, many people down in our state,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk.
Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said he fears by vetoing the bill instead of signing it and asking for specific adjustments, Lamont may have opened the floodgates to more widespread changes to the bill.
“It seems like this veto is really geared towards one particular area in our state, and it was short-sighted,” Felipe said, referring to much of the opposition, which centered in Fairfield County. “It was a mistake, and I really hope that we have the wherewithal to stick together and put together another good bill, because the more time comes off the clock, the harder it is for us to start addressing the housing crisis.”
Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, said House Republicans haven’t been involved in negotiations on the new version of the housing bill, which he views as part of the problem. He has ideas, he said, but hasn’t had a meeting with Lamont to talk about them.
Lamont wasn’t clear last Monday, when he vetoed H.B. 5002, about what specific changes he wanted to see, although he said he wanted to push for policy that got town leadership more on board. Later in the week, details still weren’t available from his office.
“The Governor continues to meet with legislative and policy staff on developing aspects of a housing bill,” Lamont’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement Thursday. “He then hopes to meet with legislative leaders and engage with local officials on a draft proposal that helps to address the housing crisis while also ensuring towns and cities are partners in the process.”
Lawmakers said they have tried for years to get local leadership on board with housing policy change, particularly through a roundtable group on affordable housing convened in 2023. They questioned how realistic it is that the governor could come up with a meaningful policy that got people on board.
“It’s been very tough up until this point, but if he has a secret sauce, then more power to him,” Duff said.
Lamont said at a press conference to announce the veto that much of the opposition he heard, some of which he classified as misinformation, was around a policy known as fair share. The policy, which has been used in New Jersey for decades, would have required that towns plan and zone for a set number of units of affordable housing.
The numbers were based on a formula that divided up the regional housing need among towns. Felipe said there might be some adjustments to that approach to add more consideration for how much land is available to build housing in a municipality.
Rojas said there may also be adjustments to create a more robust process for towns to appeal their assigned numbers, although that process was already established in the bill Lamont vetoed.
“What is particularly troubling is that the governor’s decision seems to have been made in large part based on objections that were coming from misinformation-fueled objections,” said Erin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, which advocated for and helped craft the fair share portion. “We really can’t be a state that grounds its public policy on misinformation.”
Lamont also indicated he wanted to make changes to a policy that would ban formulaic parking requirements for smaller residential developments. The idea sparked opposition from local leadership who said it might result in not enough parking for residents, particularly those with mobility issues.
Casey Moran, a founder of CT Parking Reform, said these formulaic requirements are widespread. In Naugatuck, for example, studio apartments require at least three parking spaces. In Trumbull, accessory dwelling units require four parking spaces.
Adding parking makes building housing more expensive and takes up more land. Parking lots also create runoff that can hurt the environment.
Rojas said there may be changes to be made to the parking portion, although he didn’t get into detail.
Duff said that negotiations on the bill “can’t just be one-sided,” and that Senate Democrats want to add in a provision of the bill that would increase school construction reimbursement rates for towns that have at least 10% designated affordable housing. 
They’d removed that provision because they’d been told the governor would veto the bill if it was present, Duff said.
Lawmakers and advocates said it’s unlikely that there will be changes to a policy known as “Work, Live, Ride,” which prioritizes certain state infrastructure funding for towns that increase residential density near public transit.
Lamont last week also mentioned opposition to a measure that would have required towns to allow commercial properties to be turned into smaller housing complexes without a special hearing before planning and zoning boards.
Rojas said there may be changes to that policy.
Despite potential changes, he said he doesn’t think there’s a policy that will get everyone on board and significantly increase housing in Connecticut.
“Sometimes leaders using the authority and the power that they have, just need to lead, and that’s the way I feel about us at the state level and certainly at the executive branch level,” Rojas said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-01 05:01:58.103237

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor/States Newsroom.)Ohio lawmakers are trying once more to pass a controversial firearms measure building a wall between local officers and federal agencies.
To supporters, the bill is an expression of the anti-commandeering doctrine found in the Tenth Amendment. Opponents argue it’s a new attempt at nullification and its restrictions on federal cooperation will kneecap cops and prosecutors.
What’s in the bill
At the heart of Ohio House Bill 382, known as the Second Amendment Preservation Act, is a prohibition on state and local law enforcement agencies working with federal counterparts to enforce federal laws or regulations.
The bill allows ordinary citizens to sue Ohio agencies over alleged violations and imposes a $50,000 civil penalty per occurrence.

The driving idea behind the proposal is that states have the right and obligation to uphold firearms rights against any threat — notably, “foreign or domestic.”
Backers believe agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have instituted regulations that violate Second Amendment rights, and that those restrictions are unconstitutional given the Tenth Amendment’s constraints on federal authority.
“This bill is a serious and necessary response to very real threats,” Ohio Gun Owners Executive Director Chris Dorr argued in a press release. He bragged that already 35 lawmakers have signed on to the proposal, “standing shoulder-to-shoulder with gun owners and making it clear: Ohio will not be a tool for federal tyranny.”
Although Dorr and other supporters reach for lofty arguments, the proposal’s inciting incident was relatively banal. The ATF under former President Joe Biden moved to restrict pistol braces.
Historically, it’s an accessory helping people with disabilities steady their aim, but in more recent years the braces have morphed into an attachment that allows a shooter to brace a weapon against their shoulder like a rifle.
Backers voice support for bill keeping Ohio cops from enforcing federal gun laws

The ATF’s final rule left out the former but required gun owners with the latter to register the weapon, alter it (removing the brace or elongating the barrel), or destroy the weapon.
The latest bill includes a provision meant to hamper enforcement of pistol brace regulations in Ohio, but Courts have since put the rule on hold. The current Trump administration also seems unlikely to defend it, but Dorr insists that’s no reason not to act.
“Pro-gun momentum like we are seeing under President Trump doesn’t last forever,” Dorr argued. “We have the votes. We have the people. We have the support. Now is the time to act — not next year, not after the next election — now.”
Where things get murky
The latest iteration of the proposal also brings back a section of legislative findings — essentially a statement of purpose written into statute. Among its assertions, federal powers not explicitly granted in the Constitution “are unauthoritative and of no force;” the supremacy clause does not extend to firearm restrictions “within the borders of Ohio;” and federal authority over commerce and taxes “merely identify” the government’s “limited powers,” rather than allowing it to “diminish” the right to bear arms.
Because the separation of powers doctrine generally places that kind of legal interpretation under the court’s purview, that section was quickly removed the last time lawmakers debated the bill.
Still, the new proposal attempts to distance itself from some of the more controversial provisions in the previous version. For instance, a prohibition on state and local agencies hiring people who previously worked for the federal government does not appear in the latest draft.
And for all the bill’s bright line assertions about where federal authorities ends, several carveouts underscore that it’s just not that simple.
State and local agencies rely on federal support on a daily basis — the national ballistics database, which helps draw links between firearms used in multiple crimes, offers just one example. Interagency task forces are crucial in drug and human trafficking investigations.
“This bill is a stinker.” Opponents bash Ohio Second Amendment ‘sanctuary’ legislation

Both examples were leveled by opponents last time the bill was offered, and sponsors amended the bill to allow them. However, critics argue those tweaks can’t redeem a flawed proposal.
Lou Tobin heads up the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association. In an email he said he appreciates the sponsor “trying to address” problems that came up before. In practice, though, he doesn’t think the changes will make a difference.
Pointing to the ballistics database, Tobin said, “it only allows that ‘to enforce the laws of the state or a political subdivision’ when entering information into a national database necessarily assists federal law enforcement, too.”
“Allowing us to refer violent felonies to federal prosecutors when there are ‘ancillary’ weapons violations sounds like a compromise,” Tobin added, “but what ‘ancillary’ means in this context remains unclear. The bill says explicitly that it ‘shall be construed strictly against the state.’ So the bill is still going to have a chilling effect on law enforcement efforts to address violent crime in this state because people aren’t going to want to be sued.”
Erick Bellomy’s father was shot and killed in a botched robbery in 2017.
He now heads up the Ohio chapter of Brady United Against Gun Violence and said he’s “appalled” at lawmakers continuing to advance legislation like the Second Amendment Preservation Act.
“Law enforcement officers and police chiefs across the state have warned this bill makes it harder—not easier—to keep our communities safe,” he added. “When law enforcement and public safety leaders oppose a bill, we should listen.”
Bellomy criticized the legislation’s carveouts as “confusing and contradictory,” warning they “threaten to paralyze law enforcement.”
Like Tobin, he criticized provisions limiting cooperation with federal prosecutors unless gun charges are only “ancillary” to the case. The restriction is “so vague that it may prevent prosecutors from pursuing justice in violent cases involving guns,” Bellomy argued.
If lawmakers want to protect Ohioans, Bellomy said, they should focus on safe storage, extreme risk protection orders and community violence intervention efforts.
“These are real, evidence-based strategies that reduce gun deaths—without infringing on anyone’s Second Amendment rights,” he argued.
“Let me be clear: no one wants to take guns away from law-abiding citizens,” Bellomy added. “What we want is to ensure that guns are stored safely, used responsibly, and kept out of the hands of those with malicious intent or a history of violence.”

So can consumers in surrounding states, it said.
Tariffs — which are taxes on imports — affect various sectors of the economy differently. Retailers who participated in the survey were the group that said it was most likely to pass on increased costs from Trump’s tariffs. 
A full 90% said they expected to raise prices in the next six months. Seventy two percent of manufacturers and 71% of construction businesses said the same. Minorities of professional-services firms (43%), financial-services firms (38%), and freight carriers (20%) said the tariffs would increase their costs enough to force them to raise prices.
After taking office, Trump announced tariffs on almost all of the country’s trading partners. Then in early April, he said he would delay most for 90 days to give time to negotiate what he saw as more equitable deals. Very few deals have been completed with the 90-day deadline set to expire next week.
Trump said that even without deals in place, he’s not interested in extending the deadline beyond July 9.

“We’ll look at how a country treats us — are they good, are they not so good — some countries we don’t care, we’ll just send a high (tariff) number out,” the Associated Press quoted Trump as saying on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” 
For businesses and customers in the region represented by the Cleveland Fed, tariffs are a serious matter, the report shows. The Cleveland Fed represents Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. 
Eight times a year, the agency conducts its Survey of Regional Conditions and Expectations. The great majority of respondents to the May survey didn’t see Trump’s tariffs as helping their businesses.
Seventy percent said they’d have a negative impact on their businesses over the next six months and 20% said they’d have no impact. Just 9% of businesses said the Trump tariffs would be good for them over the short term.
How negative businesses were about Trump’s tariffs was related to how dependent they are on imports.
Retail, the sector that overwhelmingly said it would raise prices, said it got 27% of its inputs from overseas. That was followed by manufacturing, at 18%, construction, at 14%, freight, at 8%, businesses and professional services, at 6%, and financial services, at 2%.
Even though businesses in the financial services sector aren’t worried that the Trump tariffs will push their input costs up, they have another worry: that people will have less money for them to manage. Ninety percent of firms that responded said the tariffs would decrease demand for their services over the coming six months. 
More than half of businesses in every sector said they expected demand for their goods and services to decrease. And, compared to the February survey, the businesses seem more pessimistic generally.
“More firms were expecting to decrease employment, capital spending, and inventory levels than increase them because of higher tariffs. The share of firms expecting to decrease employment rose to 32 percent compared to 22 percent in our February survey,” the report said.

(Otto Kitsinger for States Newsroom.)The proposals to overturn legislation overhauling higher education, eliminate property taxes, and end qualified immunity will not be on the November ballot, despite advocates trying to get the question to Ohio voters.
Public education advocates have fallen short 50,000 signatures of the needed 250,000 to put a referendum on the Ohio ballot, Youngstown State University Professor Dr. Cryshanna Jackson Leftwich said. She was aiming to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 1, a controversial college overhaul bill.
The effort was led by a small grassroots organization made up of mainly Youngstown State professors like Jackson Leftwich. The group had no money, no backing from statewide or national education groups or paid canvassers — which she said was a problem.
Typically, successful coalitions submit hundreds of thousands more signatures, because oftentimes they are invalid.
When Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the group putting an amendment on the ballot to protect abortion, IVF and contraception, they submitted 300,000 more signatures than needed as cushion room. The group needed around 415,000, submitted 710,000 and ended with about 500,000 valid.
“It shouldn’t take millions of dollars to fight [for] democracy,” she said. “It shouldn’t take millions of dollars for consultants and lawyers for average voting citizens to say, ‘Hey, this is an unjust bill.'”
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, the top Republican on the influential Finance Committee, introduced the legislation.
“It provides for a policy to be established for what I call intellectual diversity, which is very important,” Cirino said. “It means openness to all various thoughts about various issues, which is the opposite of indoctrination — indoctrination is when you expose students to only one train of thought, so a monolithic thought environment. That is not good for students.”
This massive bill focuses on what the Republican calls “free speech,” banning public universities in Ohio from Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives, or having “bias” in the classroom, and limiting how “controversial topics” can and can’t be taught. Eliminating DEI would mean no diversity offices, training, or scholarships.
“I believe that will benefit students greatly and produce better students who know how to think and analyze and come to their own conclusions,” he added.
Students and professors from across the state have continued to argue that there is nothing wrong with their education, and they are furious that lawmakers are trying to interrupt their classes.
This is one of the most protested-against bills in recent Ohio history. There were roughly 1,500 people who submitted opponent testimony against S.B. 1, and there were about 30 who submitted in support. Which is why Amanda Fehlbaum, a YSU professor, was shocked when no larger organizations “stepped up” to help them, she said.
The group raised $45,000 in six weeks and collected the signatures without any paid assistance, which was very challenging, Fehlbaum added, emphasizing that larger groups said that a referendum would be “too expensive,” she said.
Cirino said Thursday that he isn’t surprised that the effort failed, because he said the bill is good policy.
“I think their biggest problem was that this was a group of disgruntled faculty members, mostly from Youngstown State, who are satisfied with the status quo in higher education,” he said. “They couldn’t be more detached from reality in terms of what needs to be done to make Ohio’s Higher Ed the very best we can be.”
But the S.B. 1 repeal wasn’t the only “everyday” group that couldn’t get on the ballot.
The Citizens for Property Tax Reform didn’t submit the signatures they gathered.
“It’s such a huge undertaking,” organizer Beth Blackmarr said Thursday.
Blackmarr helped create a coalition of homeowners in Cuyahoga County, hoping to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would eliminate property taxes.
Her team, Citizens for Property Tax Reform, knew they weren’t near the 415,000 they needed. She didn’t have an estimate of how many they collected, nor how much money they raised.
“As naive as we are, we may have underestimated, just a little bit, how big the response was really going to be,” she said. “That’s been quite rewarding, so we’ve asked everybody to keep on trucking and keep going.”
Despite both being grassroots, her situation is different from Jackson Leftwich’s for two main reasons: constitutional amendment proposals can be pushed back to future elections, and she told us a month ago that her proposal didn’t even have to reach the ballot.
“Hopefully, what legislators will do is counter with some legislation of their own,” she told me in May.
And it has worked.
“I’m hoping this does help to push us,” State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said when asked about the tax amendment.
Thomas leads property tax relief discussions in the House and said that he and the other members heard Blackmarr. Since her amendment, lawmakers have been proposing more property tax relief bills and have passed several in the budget.
“This is a win-win for Ohio,” Blackmarr said.
Strategy has to come into play when getting an issue proposed statewide, she added.
“Ohio makes it as difficult as possible,” YSU’s Education Association President Mark Vopat said, detailing all of the work that must be done to go through the extensive collection process. “I believe that the state has made it as onerous as possible for individual citizens like us, — we’re doing this as a voluntary effort — to actually get some sort of referendum passed.”
For all ballot proposals, campaigns need valid signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
For referendums, the total signatures must be 6% of the total votes cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 248,092 valid signatures.
For initiated statutes, the total signatures must be 3% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 124,046 valid signatures.
For constitutional amendments, the total signatures must be 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. This makes the number about 413,487 valid signatures.
There have been efforts to make this harder, though.
Republican leaders in Columbus are floating the idea of attempting to make it more difficult to amend the state constitution, a proposal that was defeated in 2023 by Ohioans across the political spectrum.
Issue 1 in 2023 would have taken away majority rule in Ohio. The proposed constitutional amendment would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments to pass from 50%+1, a simple majority, to 60%. It was defeated 57-43%.
The following year, 2024, the Senate GOP moved to increase the amount of counties campaigns must collect from and put more bureaucratic layers on advocates. They wanted to require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a political action committee (PAC).
This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.
Other challenges campaigns can face deal with the political offices they must go through.
Ohio activists are starting to gather signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would end qualified immunity — a protection for police and other government officials that prevents citizens from suing them.
State law prevents government officials from being held liable for civil damages unless the victim can prove that the officer violated their constitutional rights, which can be an uphill battle, advocates say.
The Ohio Coalition to End Qualified Immunity has been battling Attorney General Dave Yost to get their summary language approved so that they can collect signatures. He has rejected it eight times, and recently, in short, courts have required him to allow them to move forward.
From their approval, they would have only had two months at most to collect signatures. Although initially hopeful for November, their team told us Thursday that they are now aiming for 2026.
But when it comes to S.B. 1, Jackson Leftwich said this isn’t the end for them, either.
“If we got this on the ballot, we would have overturned it,” she said.
The group didn’t specify if and how they would try again, or just rely on the larger groups in future years.

(1 July 2025) – Delaware will start legal adult-use cannabis sales on August 1, 2020, marking an important milestone in the First State’s cannabis legalization effort. According to the Office of the Marijuana Commissioner, all licensed medical marijuana converts can begin recreational sales August 1.


 Joshua Sanderlin, the new Marijuana Commission, said: “The beginning of legal adult-use cannabis sales is a reflection of our tireless efforts and strong partnerships with State agencies, industry stakeholder and community leaders.” “Our focus is to build a safe, fair, and accountable market for marijuana that provides real benefits for Delawareans.” We will continue to grant conditional licenses for previously selected applicants in order to make sure they can start operations.


 Delaware passed legislation in 2023 legalizing recreational marijuana for adults and creating a comprehensive system that includes cultivators, manufacturers and retailers as well as testing laboratories. The focus was on applicants who were based on social equity. The law also established the Office of the Marijuana Commission to oversee the program, and create a robust regulatory structure. The proposed regulations were published in May 2024, and the finalized regulations in September 2024 following two rounds of public comments. The regulations of the Office Marijuana commissioner define licensing requirements for the industry and operational standards.


 The launch of a legal market for adult-use cannabis in Delaware, which prioritizes safety, equity and accountability, is a significant step forward. This new industry will create real opportunities for entrepreneurs, as well as generate vital revenue to support our schools, public health systems and infrastructure. The revenue generated by this market will also allow us to invest in communities that have been most affected by the drug war, correcting past wrongs, and making sure the benefits reach all corners of the state. I’m proud that we are moving quickly and carefully to create a cannabis industry that reflects our values, and provides more opportunities for all Delawareans .”


 The General Assembly passed additional measures in 2024 to strengthen Delaware’s program. House Bill 334 expanded the program parameters, while House Bill 408 created a transition path for medical marijuana businesses to enter the adult-use market. The licenses were expensive, costing $200,000 for cultivation and $100 for manufacturing or retail. This resulted to $4 million of critical funding for social equity applicants.


 OMC has announced that it will receive 1,269 licenses paid for during the period of August 19 to September 30 in October 2024. This is a substantial increase over its original projections.

 OMC will announce the winners of its lottery for 125 licenses available in December 2024.


 OMC is committed to creating a market for adult-use marijuana in Delaware that is well-regulated, compliant and fair. As implementation progresses, we will provide more updates.

Medicaid recipients fear potentially devastating cuts,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/pa-medicaid-recipients-fear-potentially-devastating-cuts/,"“Medicaid literally saved my life and my daughter’s life. I don’t want to be dramatic, but if it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”","Lauren Stuparitz and her son (photo courtesy of Stuparitz)It wasn’t until she was 20 years old and pregnant with her son that Brittany Groover first applied for Medicaid. Growing up in a working class, western Pennsylvania household before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, Groover’s father was insured through work, but she and her mom weren’t.
“My parents were the people that made just a little too much money to qualify for assistance,” she said. “I don’t recall going to the doctors for checkups. We would only go to urgent care if I had an ear infection or something.”
Once she was covered, the safety net allowed her peace of mind during her pregnancy. And six years later, in 2021, it allowed her to get treatment when she was diagnosed with stage 3a melanoma that spread to her lymph nodes. 
“I looked this up recently, because this has been a big, hot topic,” she said. “One immunotherapy treatment was $42,000. I had to do 18 of them.”

After 18 sessions of immunotherapy and three surgeries, Groover is in remission. And the experience led her to take up advocacy. Last year, she began working with the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network, where she encourages healthy habits and tries to educate people on the importance of Medicaid.
But now, Groover, 31, is worried about what could come next.
She is one of more than three million Pennsylvanians — over one in five people — who are insured through Medicaid. According to the Cancer Action Network she is also among the one in 10 Americans with a history of cancer who are insured through the program, including one in three children newly diagnosed. So, she is paying close attention to whether Congress moves forward with steep cuts to the programs being pushed by the Trump administration.
“I’ve been thinking about this non-stop,” Groover said. “If I lose my Medicaid, and my appointment comes up for a PET scan, I would genuinely be thinking, ‘If I go to that and put myself in debt, then how am I going to pay for food, or put a roof over my head or take care of my son?’ That’s what every single person on Medicaid is dealing with.”
The proposed cuts are part of a sweeping budget bill that will enact many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities. The proposal, which only needs a simple majority vote, has already passed the U.S. House along partisan lines.
As it stands, senate Republicans spent Monday voting on a series of amendments in an attempt to unite divided factions of their party, with some concerned about the bill’s overall price tag, and others worried about the impacts of cuts to programs like Medicaid and food assistance. If passed, the bill will be returned to the House for a final vote or additional changes
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the bill could result in nearly 12 million fewer Americans having health insurance by 2034. 
At the state level, the commonwealth’s Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage. Another 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases, Val Arkoosh, the department’s head, has said.
Pennsylvania’s 10 Republican congressmen unanimously voted in support of the House version of the bill that passed last month. In a recent town hall, Sen. Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania’s only Republican in the Senate, also signaled support for reining in Medicaid spending. 
McCormick said the aim was not to reduce Medicaid spending from current levels, but to curb the program’s growth and refocus it on helping children, the elderly, the mentally ill and the disabled.
“Medicaid has been spiraling out of control,” he said. “We want to ensure that Medicaid protects the vulnerable people for whom it was designed”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As the bill stands, this is primarily accomplished through new work requirements that would mandate most Medicaid recipients prove they work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month, or qualify for an exemption. McCormick said the goal is to ensure that healthy, able-bodied adults are not using the service. Critics say it’s a disguised effort to decrease spending by throwing up bureaucratic red tape for people who would otherwise be covered.
The next largest source of cuts would stem from a provision forcing states to lower taxes on health care providers like hospitals and nursing homes that help raise additional funding for Medicaid. The bill would require states to incrementally lower those provider taxes from a maximum of 6% down to 3.5% by 2032. 
Critics of provider taxes say they’re an accounting trick that allows the state to get additional Medicaid match funds from the federal government, with the revenue often returning to the health care providers that paid them in the first place. But defenders say they’ve become a critical source of funding.
The state Department of Human Services said the change could result in $2.7 billion in lost funds when they take full effect in 2032. That includes both the state revenue from the taxes as well as the federal Medicaid matching funds.
‘I felt so helpless’
Patrick Keenan, the director of policy at the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, an advocacy group, says a large majority of people on Medicaid who can work already do.
“Our analysis shows that 4% of folks on Medicaid aren’t working or qualified for an exemption to work requirements,” Keenan said. It’s a number that’s roughly in line with the national unemployment rate.
Moreover, Keenan said that, in practice, work requirements primarily result in a lot of people who should qualify for Medicaid not receiving it. 
“A lot of folks that are working and eligible get cut from the program, because it’s very difficult to get all the documentation, on one hand,” he said. “On another hand, it’s very difficult for all that documentation to be processed correctly, and there’s no additional funding for that — or very little — from Congress.”

Keenan pointed to Arkansas and Georgia, the only two states that have implemented Medicaid work requirements. In Arkansas, the requirement led to thousands losing insurance who previously qualified for Medicaid expansion, an Affordable Care Act program that allowed states to offer Medicaid to low-income adults. Arkansas’ work requirement program ultimately ended in 2019, after a judge declared it “arbitrary and capricious.”  In Georgia, the rollout of a program to offer expanded Medicaid coverage to a small group who could prove they met work requirements resulted in far fewer than expected actually enrolled. While the state estimated 246,000 people would be eligible, only 6,500 ended up actually enrolled, and it ultimately cost more per person to enroll them than it would have in other states that offered blanked Medicaid expansions.
For context, the U.S. House bill’s work requirements would apply to an even larger share of the Medicaid population than Georgia’s.
The CBO estimated that the proposed work requirements alone will result in five million fewer Americans receiving Medicaid by 2034. The report added only a few would likely be able to get insurance through an employer afterward.
The bill would also make it harder for anyone who can’t meet work requirements to get a plan through the federally funded health care marketplace. That’s because they would become ineligible for premium tax credits. Those tax credits are a mechanism in the Affordable Care Act that keeps marketplace prices down for low- and middle-income families. They can be paid directly to an insurance provider to lower monthly costs, and often lower premiums by hundreds of dollars.
But, the burden of ensuring Medicaid recipients all qualify for the program will ultimately fall on the state officials who oversee it. The bill would require Medicaid administrators to ensure enrollees are meeting work requirements at least every six months.
Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the state Department of Human Services, said the new reporting requirements could “create an unprecedented and unfunded increase in the administrative burden on DHS that will strain existing operations and divert resources from mission-critical service delivery across the Medicaid and SNAP Programs.”
Even without that added strain, administrative errors can already lead to people losing health care.
In 2010, Lauren Stuparitz, a Pittsburgh native, was assaulted and suffered a head injury. For years, she struggled to read and concentrate, and was regularly in pain.
After three years, she gave up her teaching job and qualified for Medicaid, which she said helped her receive treatment that otherwise would have been unattainable. While she still suffers side effects, it was an enormous help.
“It’s been lifesaving,” Stuparitz, 40, said of Medicaid. “I feel like people use that word a lot, but I’m not actually sure what else to use because I don’t know if I’d have much of a quality of life without it.”
When her first son was born in 2020, he also received insurance through Medicaid. The safety net has been essential, especially since he was diagnosed with autism.
But, last year, Stuparitz hit a roadblock when she tried to recertify her Medicaid eligibility. 
At the time, she was doing temp work for the U.S. Census Bureau and making more money than usual. She says the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services incorrectly used that temporary pay to determine her annual income. 
As a result, she was told she no longer qualified and that her son was being switched to CHIP, a program for children in households that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.

“I felt so helpless, honestly,” she said. “If I have to lose my insurance, that’s fine, but I need my son to be able to get what he needs.”
Her son had come to rely on regular appointments with early development specialists, who she learned didn’t accept his new insurance.
“For kids who are on the spectrum, having the routine is a critical thing,” Stuparitz said. “When things are in flux, it throws them off. It was probably one of the most stressful things I’ve ever had to deal with in my life.”
So for weeks, Stuparitz built up medical debt while she tried to get the situation rectified. She struggled to get through to a person in the Medicaid office who could help, and when she did, she said she was usually told to resubmit documents online.
Eventually, Stuparitz said she was able to prove she qualified for Medicaid, and was also able to bill the insurance for her son’s unpaid appointments.
While Stuparitz doesn’t blame the Department of Human Services or hold a grudge, she worries that what happened to her may become far more common if the amount of bureaucracy for people on Medicaid is increased.
“It’s just something that happens when you have a large system,” Stuparitz said. “But if your income’s not very cut and dry, I think it’s easier to happen. I feel like it has to be common, especially if you’re dealing with people who have a health condition that prevents them from working steady hours.”
A spokesperson for the department did not comment on the specifics of Stuparitz’s case when asked, but said “DHS works diligently to ensure the benefits DHS administers get to the eligible Pennsylvanians who need and qualify for them.”
“If it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”
Jennifer Rabe-Coulibaly, 42, has lived her life between Middletown, in Dauphin County, and west Africa. Her parents were missionaries, and she followed in their footsteps. That means traveling back and forth every few months or years. 
Rabe-Coulibaly asked that the specific country not be named because of threats emanating from conflict there.
In 2021, Rabe-Coulibaly married a west African man, Emmanuel Coulibaly. In 2023, after he got a green card, they flew to Pennsylvania, where they’ve been living since. 
Overseas, both can be insured through the mission, but when they came to the U.S., they were unable to afford the premiums themselves. They both applied for Pennie, Pennsylvania’s marketplace option that provides more affordable insurance for low- and middle-income people who don’t qualify for Medicaid.
Almost immediately, they put their plans to use.

For Coulibaly, it meant receiving care for an issue he dealt with almost his entire life. As a child in west Africa, he was injured and his two legs developed to be different sizes. In America, with insurance, he was finally able to get treatment.
Coulibaly’s leg required major surgery and a hip replacement. When he failed to recover properly, he needed another operation.
“Without Pennie, my husband wouldn’t have been able to go through these operations,” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “One of the doctors said if he didn’t, in 10, 20 years, he’d be in a wheelchair.”
Meanwhile, Rabe-Coulibaly had become pregnant, which qualified her for Medicaid.
At 40, this meant more frequent doctor’s visits. At the same time, she was helping her husband recover, and had to go to his doctor’s appointments to translate. He speaks French and is still learning English.
“My (obstetrician), she’s like, ‘You need to take it easy,’” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “I said, ‘I wish, but I can’t.’ It was a lot.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At eight months, Rabe-Coulibaly developed preeclampsia, and her baby was delivered with a cesarean-section. While both she and her baby are now healthy, things seemed so bad initially, Coulibaly later told her he thought she or the baby was going to die.
“Medicaid literally saved my life and my daughter’s life,” Coulibaly said. “I don’t want to be dramatic, but if it’s cut, it’s almost going to be like killing people.”
The experience has informed her perspective on Medicaid, Pennie and the potential impacts of Congress’ budget bill.
To start with, Rabe-Coulibaly isn’t sure that she’d be able to prove she meets work requirements, given the nature of her job. While in Pennsylvania, Coulibaly works for the mission, answering phone calls and emails, and making presentations at churches.She logs hours and files her taxes as self-employed, but is paid different amounts monthly, depending entirely on donations.
“It would depend on what Medicaid wants as far as documentation,” she said. “What I’ve been doing is just writing down on a piece of notebook paper what I’m doing.”
It’s also opened her eyes to how tenuous health care can be. 
In a previous version of the bill, many legal migrants, like Coulibaly, would have been barred from receiving premium tax credits that help pay for Affordable Care Act plans like Pennie, until they’ve been in the country for five years.
Without the additional funds, Rabe-Coulibaly said, her husband would not have been able to afford insurance.
That part, however, was struck down by the Senate parliamentarian on the grounds that such a move would require 60 votes, and not the 51 allowed by the reconciliation process.
A number of Republicans, as well as Trump, called for the parliamentarian to be overruled, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) and others said they had no intention to do so.
Still, the attempt has been on Rabe-Coulibaly’s mind.
Rabe-Coulibaly understands why people think non-citizens shouldn’t have access to social services generally, but she worries about what the future may hold for legal immigrants like her husband.
“The U.S. has a reputation of welcoming people from other cultures,” Rabe-Coulibaly said. “Part of that welcoming is to help them out in times of need. I’m not talking about taking advantage of the system, because I know there’s that out there, but I’m talking about in times of need, letting people like my husband benefit from some of these programs.”
It’s been another concern that’s kept her watching, like Brittany Groover and Lauren Stuparitz, as Congress debates the fate of health care programs that all three described as life saving.
“I was never a political person before all this,” Groover said about how she was affected by threats to Medicaid. “I wasn’t even registered to vote until last year.”
It’s one reason Groover wants to share her story, which she does on a YouTube channel and with the Cancer Action Network.
“All these people, they keep saying people are fraudulently on medicaid.” she said. “That is not a real thing that’s happening. I’m the person you’re talking about. I’m not abusing the system. I’m using the system exactly how it was designed, because it’s a lifeline for me.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7930.HEIC-769x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-01 05:01:58.103237

Thousands of Ohio jobs are at risk as Republicans in Congress decide the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, according to two new reports.


The 2022 federal climate law spurred announcements of more than $7 billion in clean energy projects in Ohio. An analysis by the nonpartisan business group E2 links those investments to nearly 5,000 announced jobs.


A separate research paper published this month by the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, used broader criteria to conclude that Republicans’ ​“One Big Beautiful Bill Act” puts more than 17,000 direct manufacturing jobs at risk in the state. The ripple effect on other sectors that work with clean energy companies could bring the number to more than 91,000.


Cleveland, Ohio-based solar company YellowLite is among the firms already pausing hiring in response to federal policy uncertainty. The company said it had planned to bring on 20 to 25 more workers this year to keep up with growing business. Those plans are now on hold.


If the threatened cuts happen, the company fears business will ​“decline dramatically,” said Al Frasz, YellowLite’s commercial business manager. ​“We will probably be in a mode of having to lay off 35% to 40% of our employees.”


Frasz is one of dozens of business, labor, civic, and other leaders in Ohio calling upon Congress to revise the current reconciliation budget bill to preserve the IRA tax credits and other clean energy provisions.


Ohio is among the top states to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives. As of last summer, its 9th Congressional District had eight announced projects — more than any other district nationwide, according to E2, which advocates for policies that benefit the economy and the environment. Ohio also ranked among the top 10 states nationwide for announced projects.


“Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal, like the House’s, that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom,” said Michael Timberlake, E2’s communications director, when the group released its data on May 29.




















Part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s success in spurring clean energy investments stems from its 10-year time frame for tax credits, noted Joe Flarida, executive director of Power a Clean Future Ohio, which works with local governments on clean energy. That signaled to businesses and communities that there would be some stability, which is important for business planning.


“What we saw was this massive movement and response to use and leverage those tax credits in a productive way,” Flarida said. Pulling the rug out from under organizations that planned or broke ground on projects expecting those tax credits ​“is going to be a wasteful-government-spending dilemma,” he continued. ​“What we’re going to see is a ton of investment that’s taken place over the past couple of years completely vanish overnight. And this is just bad policymaking.”


The Ohio Chamber of Commerce would like the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits to continue through 2035, said Tony Long, the organization’s general counsel and director of energy policy. The state needs more energy generation, he added, noting that Ohio imports about a quarter of its electricity from other states.


“These credits will help continue to drive new development of energy sources,” Long said, noting that IRA tax credits have helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.


Private businesses won’t be the only ones impacted if Congress cuts or severely curtails the clean energy credits. ​“Direct-pay” provisions allow local governments and schools to access incentives after completing qualifying projects. Cities and counties in Ohio are already counting on more than $160 million in savings from those credits, 30 local government leaders told the state’s congressional delegation this spring.


Consumers also can expect higher electricity prices in the absence of clean energy credits, since less incentive to build new power plants means less energy in the marketplace. Full repeal of the tax credits could cost U.S. households an average of more than $110 per year, and businesses could expect a 10% increase in electricity costs, the Clean Energy Buyers Association estimated in February.


Debates continue on the federal reconciliation bill, which Republicans aim to pass in July. Impacts on businesses, workers, and communities will depend on the final provisions.

(Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)In coming weeks, our news feeds will be loaded with stories on the Trump administration’s plan to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the nation’s Medicaid program.
Already, we’ve heard stories about non-U.S. citizens being on the rolls, able-bodied adults not having to work, and — of course — widespread fraud and abuse.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
Before we go down this road, as Kansans, we need to get a few things straight.
Medicaid and Medicare are not the same thing. Medicare is designed to ensure health care for those of us over 65; Medicaid tries to do the same for the poor, our elders and people with disabilities.
Because Medicaid is underwritten by a mix of state and federal funds, states have a say in how their programs are administered. Since 2012, the Kansas Legislature has balked at taking advantage of federal incentives meant to close post-Obamacare gaps in Medicaid eligibility. Consequently, Kansas’ Medicaid program — known as KanCare — is one of the most restrictive in the nation.
Depending on your politics, you may think this is a good thing. But it doesn’t stop uninsured people from going to the emergency room. Hospitals just won’t be paid for treating them.
Other Kansas-specific facts to consider:

Childless adults are not eligible for Medicaid.
A parent caring for children is not eligible for Medicaid if their income exceeds 38% of the “federal poverty level,” which, for a parent with two kids, comes to about $843 a month.
The kids are most likely eligible, but the parents are not. Still, 70 percent of parents on Medicaid are working. Typically, the remaining 30 percent are either enrolled in a job training program or at home caring for a frail elder or child who should not be left alone.
Between 30 and 40% of all births are covered by Medicaid. About half of Medicaid recipients in Kansas are children.
In dire emergencies involving patients who aren’t U.S. citizens — complicated childbirths, for example — doctors and hospitals might be eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. The billing process, however, is ill-defined, restrictive and often not worth the hassle.

In Kansas, Medicaid does not pay for non-emergent care for non-citizens. Other states’ programs are not as restrictive.
In its latest annual report, the Kansas Attorney General’s Office notes that from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, its Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Unit “obtained judgements” for more than $308,000. During the same period, Medicaid spending in Kansas came in around $5.5 billion. That’s not a lot. The unit’s 2024 report isn’t out yet.
Forty percent of Kansas nursing home residents’ stays are covered by Medicaid.
To be clear, Medicaid does not give money to poor people. Instead, it pays KanCare providers — three giant, for-profit managed care organizations — to provide care. These providers also are charged with helping frail elders and people with disabilities live in community-based settings because it’s a lot cheaper than paying for nursing homes to care for them.
Nevertheless, nursing homes are loaded with Medicaid patients and community-based options have long waiting lists.
Cutting Medicaid won’t help.
Analysts who have studied the contents of the “big, beautiful bill” working its way through Congress are telling advocates to be on the lookout for three scenarios.
First, Supporters will insist they don’t want to cut Medicaid; instead, they will say we need to increase accountability because there’s so much fraud and abuse. And for this to happen, current and would-be recipients will need to jump through additional documentation hoops. Those who stumble won’t be eligible. Fewer recipients will result in less spending.
Second, The bill calls for rescinding a Biden-era regulation that required nursing homes to hire more nurses and nurse aids. Shelving the requirement would trim billions of dollars in proposed Medicaid spending. The nursing home industry supports the change, arguing its profit margins wouldn’t cover the costs and even if they did, there aren’t enough nurses and aids available for hire.
Finally, Medicaid has long allowed states to collect a “surcharge” from hospitals with the understanding that the revenues would be used to draw down additional federal dollars. Hospitals welcomed the arrangement, knowing that for every dollar put in, they would get back roughly $1.50. The bill’s supporters, however, call this “money laundering.” Lawmakers hope to either freeze or significantly reduce the federal payments, ignoring repeated warnings that many rural hospitals would be forced to close or downsize.
A recent survey by the REACH Healthcare Foundation and the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund found that 26 rural hospitals in Kansas are already in “immediate risk of closure,” and another 63 are teetering.
A review commissioned by the Kansas Hospital Association found that “over half” of the state’s hospitals are “operating at a loss.”
None of this is good for Kansas, and no one knows this better than our own senators and representatives.

It was at the height of the eugenics movement and growing nativism in the U.S. after WWI. Congress had passed increasingly restrictive immigration laws that put a new emphasis on “desirables” and “undesirables” in deciding who was allowed to emigrate from where. 
The Senate sponsor of the 1924 Immigration Act, Republican David Reed of Pennsylvania, wrote that the law’s goal was to make the United States a more “homogenous” country.  
Mass immigration threatened to “dilute” that uniformity (sound familiar?) so national origins quotas were introduced to greatly curb or ban any group deemed not American enough or not expected to readily fuse with the native-born population. 
The xenophobic policies of the early 20th century — making a toxic resurgence in 2025 — slammed the door on Slavic immigrants who spoke strange languages and didn’t easily assimilate. 
The only reason a Slovak teenager with a basket trunk of belongings could find her way to Cleveland, Ohio was because she had been born in America. 
Years earlier, her parents had filed through Ellis Island with thousands of other immigrants bound for jobs in the industrial Midwest. They settled in Pa. but did not became U.S. citizens. Eventually the tug of familial ties in Sačurov drug the family back home to their rural village.  
Years later, my grandmother, prodded by her Slovak mother, would return to redeem her birthright citizenship.  
It was all she had to start a new life in Ohio but more than the rest of her foreign-born family, save a younger brother, to come to the U.S. The young woman who couldn’t speak a lick of English was an American citizen by birth — same as every other Ohioan who came into the world on American soil. 
The Constitution affirms that unconditional right even if Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost doesn’t.
Yost signed on to a brief supporting Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship. He was running for governor at the time and angling for a Trump endorsement that went to Vivek Ramaswamy. 
But Yost joined 16 GOP attorneys general to defend the indefensible; excluding babies born to undocumented immigrants and people with temporary status in the U.S. from the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause.  
In essence, the Republican AGs endorsed the power of one man to decide who, among those born in this country, is worthy of citizenship. It was grotesque sycophancy in service to a lawless megalomaniac high on his own supply of unchecked tyranny.  
Under the Trump criteria — abolishing 150 years of precedent and a longtime policy of unrestricted birthright citizenship — any baby born in the U.S. after his executive order would need to have at least one parent who is a citizen or lawful permanent resident to qualify as a citizen. 
That would exclude my grandmother today as a U.S.-born citizen to noncitizen parents and probably the grandparents of many other Ohioans born in America were they to be judged by the same standards Yost advocated in court. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
His brief argued that, despite plain text to the contrary, the Constitution “did not confer citizenship to children born to individuals who were not lawfully and permanently present in the United States.” 
Moreover, Yost and the others asserted, states like Ohio are being harmed because babies who “likely would have been born in a different country” if it weren’t for birthright citizenship, may “participate in state welfare programs…and receive state healthcare…and obtain a driver’s license.” 
Because they are American citizens “born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” 
Whether a U.S.-born child’s parents are U.S citizens, stressed the ACLU, “does not impact whether that child is a citizen.” 
That principle, upheld in a Supreme Court case more than 100 years ago, confirmed that “a child born in the U.S. to Chinese parents — who at the time were prohibited from becoming U.S. citizens — was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.” 
But the Supreme Court in 2025, stacked with Trump-appointed justices bent on giving him free reign to ignore the rule of law, just slapped down federal courts who had issued nationwide injunctions to stop Trump from implementing his clearly unconstitutional executive order.
The court’s right-wing majority basically made birthright citizenship a state by state, case by case, class-action or individual plaintiff patchwork of litigation destined to wind through lower courts for who-knows-how-long. 
In the meantime, Trump is free to roll out orders on which U.S.-born child will be denied the citizenship guaranteed to them by law in states that don’t object. 
Yost won’t object to natural-born Americans in Ohio being deprived of their rights under the 14th Amendment. The Trump bootlicker applauded those efforts and derided the judges who dared block them.  
“Democratically enacted laws (which executive orders are not) cannot be put on hold by judges who think they are kings,” said Yost with blind irony, considering the self-described king in the White House. “Americans’ freedom depends on each part of the government staying in its lane,” he puffed. 
But apparently not on fealty to the Constitution from Ohio’s chief law enforcement officer.

More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Georgia kids can continue liking, commenting and subscribing without notifying their parents this summer after a federal judge put a temporary hold on the state’s new social media age verification law while the case moves forward – but the bill’s author says a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling bodes well for the ban.
Senate Bill 351, which was set to go into effect July 1, would require social media companies to get a parent’s permission before they allowed a minor to create an account. All Georgians would also have to verify their age before accessing websites with material deemed harmful to minors.
On Thursday, Judge Amy Totenberg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in favor of NetChoice, a coalition of social media companies, who argued that the law as written would likely violate free speech protections.
“The Court does not doubt the dangers posed by young people’s overwhelming exposure to social media,” Totenberg wrote. “But, in its effort to aid parents, the Act’s solution creates serious obstacles for all Georgians, including teenagers, to engage in protected speech activities and would highly likely be unconstitutional.”
Totenberg said the law would curb the speech rights of young people, impose a burden on all Georgians to participate in online speech, potentially put Georgians’ private data at risk and step into parents’ decisions on how to raise their children.
But Totenberg said the law’s biggest downfall comes in its long list of exemptions, which include news, sports, and entertainment sites, interactive gaming platforms, streaming services and more.
“For example, SB 351 would presumably apply to the Georgia Bulldogs Reddit forum, which features user-generated content. But it would exempt Barstool Sports, which features provider-generated content. It would apply to news coverage posted by users on X, but not news coverage posted by The New York Times to its own liveblog.”
Totenberg found that amounts to a content-based restriction on speech, which triggers a higher level of scrutiny – which she said Georgia’s law doesn’t meet.
“Because of the enormous burdens imposed on the First Amendment rights of children, adults, and social media platforms — along with the significant tailoring issues inherent in the law — even the State’s serious interest here cannot justify SB 351 under the First Amendment’s rigorous standards,” she said.
NetChoice celebrated the win in a statement.
“This is a major victory for free speech, constitutional clarity and the rights of all Georgians to engage in public discourse without intrusive government overreach,” said Chris Marchese, NetChoice director of litigation. “We are grateful the court recognized what we’ve long argued: SB 351 isn’t just poorly crafted — it’s profoundly unconstitutional.”
But the bill’s author, state Sen. Jason Anavitarte, a Dallas Republican who is now the Senate majority leader, said their victory is likely to be short-lived.
In a statement, Anavitarte pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that backed a Texas state law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.
“One day after liberal Obama Appointee, US District Court Judge, Amy Totenberg, issued an injunction preventing Georgia’s age verification law from taking effect, The Supreme Court found that laws like SB 351 ‘have only an incidental effect on protected speech and that The First Amendment leaves undisturbed States’ traditional power to prevent minors from accessing speech that is obscene from their perspective….Requiring proof of age is an ordinary and appropriate means of enforcing an age-based limit on obscenity to minors,’” Anavitarte said.
“Based on Friday’s ruling at The Supreme Court, Judge Totenberg should be left with no choice but to allow SB 351 to go into effect,” he added. “I am immensely grateful for Justice Clarence Thomas’ well written opinion and remain optimistic that SB 351 will go into effect in its entirety.”
Attorney General Chris Carr’s said Carr intends to appeal the ruling.
“We will continue to defend commonsense measures that empower parents and protect our children online,” said Carr spokesperson Kara Murray.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive
relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.
The case filed by CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project includes 15 women — some under pseudonyms because of their legal status — in nine states, including Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Some are in the U.S. without documentation, some are here on visas, many have asylum or other immigration applications pending in various stages.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.

It’s between the people and the regime that has ruled them through fear, cruelty, and lies for over four decades.","The bombs have stopped—for now. After two weeks of missiles, threats, and the terrifying drumbeat of war, a ceasefire has arrived. Tel Aviv exhales. Washington strategizes. Tehran recalculates. 
But in Iran, the silence feels different. It isn’t peace. It’s a pause. And in that pause, another battle rages —quieter, older, far more consequential. Because Iran’s most dangerous war isn’t with Israel or the United States. It’s between the people and the regime that has ruled them through fear, cruelty, and lies for over four decades.
Every time Tehran fires missiles abroad, it’s also tightening the noose at home. While international cameras track explosions over airbases, Iran’s gallows work overtime. Protesters disappear. Students vanish. Women are dragged into courtrooms for removing a scarf. This regime thrives on crisis. It builds legitimacy on chaos. But that strategy is fraying. The Iranian people are done being afraid.
The movement inside Iran today is not a flash in the pan. It is not a hashtag moment. It is a generation that has risen, again and again, from the bloodied pavements of 1988 massacre of 30,000 political prisoners, from labor strikes, from underground classrooms and shuttered newspapers.
This is a citizenry refusing to kneel. They are not asking the world to save them. They are demanding that we stop strengthening the boot that crushes them.
Why does Tehran escalate abroad? Because it is desperate at home. This isn’t strength. It’s survival mode. And the regime knows its greatest threat doesn’t come from warplanes or sanctions —it comes from Iranians who no longer buy the lie.
In Tehran’s prisons sit poets, teachers, students, workers. They have no missiles. But they are more dangerous to the regime than any foreign power —because they carry a vision — a vision of a secular, democratic Iran. One without executions. One where women are free, where religion is a choice, not a weapon, and where leadership is earned, not inherited through violence. 
That vision is not vague. It has a framework. It has a leader. It has a name: the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). Led by Maryam Rajavi, the NCRI offers more than protest —it offers policy. Her 10-point plan lays out a future secular democratic republic built on rule of law, gender equality, religious liberty, and peace.
It is not abstract. It is not exiled into irrelevance. It is organized, global, and growing. Inside Iran, it inspires courage. Abroad, it is gaining bipartisan support —from the U.S. House Resolution 166 to lawmakers in over 40 countries who know appeasement has failed.
This ceasefire will tempt many leaders to breathe easy, to return to familiar calculations: sanctions relief, backchannel deals, polite diplomacy with a government that kills children for chanting slogans. But history will not be kind to that strategy. If the world fails to act now, it risks turning this pause into a permission slip—for more executions, more repression, more lies.
So what can be done?  First, designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization across Europe. They are the regime’s mafia, both in Iran and abroad. Pretending they are a legitimate military force is a diplomatic fantasy.
Second, freeze the assets of regime elites and their families. There is no moral logic in letting torturers send their children to London prep schools while they hang teenagers in Mashhad.
Third, expose and dismantle the regime’s propaganda and influence networks in Western capitals. These aren’t think tanks—they are front groups that shield tyranny.
Finally, engage the alternative. The Iranian resistance has done the hard part: they’ve survived, organized, and laid out a democratic path forward. What they need now is recognition and solidarity —not weapons, not war. Just the truth, spoken clearly.
Regimes like Iran’s rely on one illusion: that they are eternal. But they are not.  They are loud, cruel, and brittle. And they fall —when the world stops looking away.
The Iranian people are already doing the hard work of history. The question is whether the rest of us will pretend this ceasefire is peace —or finally recognize that real peace only begins when dictatorships end.
Let us not mistake this moment for stability. Let us not waste the silence. Let us help turn this pause into a pivot—toward freedom, toward justice, toward an Iran reborn.

Antonio Felipe,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/01/connecticut-needs-to-be-more-affordable-lets-start-with-housing/,"The veto of HB5002 was a massive mistake, a setback for housing in Connecticut and a slap in the face to its hard-working families.","Connecticut did not meet the moment in 2025. Despite the outcry of our residents and the glaring reality of a housing and affordability crisis in our state, we didn’t do nearly enough to support our hard-working families.
This year, as co-chair of the state’s housing committee, I, along with many of mycolleagues, championed House Bill 5002. Ensuring access to quality housing is a foundational responsibility of the entire Connecticut legislature and yet I spent almost 12 hours debating House Republicans who were determined to sink the bill under false claims of eliminating local control.

Antonio Felipe
The bill passed both chambers after receiving strong public support from Gov. Ned Lamont. Then on June 23, the governor conceded and announced that he planned to veto the bill — even though he still stated support for most of the policies. In essence the governor capitulated to what he acknowledged was false information.
If that’s how decisions are made going forward our state is in deep trouble. A veto of this bill is a massive mistake, a setback for housing in Connecticut and a slap in the face to the hard working families and the most cost-burdened of us. I’d like to tell you why.
In 5002 we saw an opportunity for significant progress in housing, taking necessary steps while ensuring that local decisions were protected and local control was minimally impacted. One section of this bill simply requires that cities and towns submit affordable housing plans. The towns themselves create and submit these plans and zoning must only be changed if it is required to fit the plan that theysubmitted. 
Municipalities also have the opportunity to submit reasons why they cannot attain the goals set in their plan. We can use those reasons to help address the needs and barriers for local zoning.
This would allow towns to individually plan to meet these goals, maintaining local control over their plan on how to achieve more affordable housing. Another section called Work Live Ride is an optional program that incentivizes development near transportation hubs to ensure a vibrant workforce and that the current hardworking Connecticut residents can easily get where they need to go.
What are we doing about the actual building of affordable or multifamily housing in HB 5002?
There is over $100 million specifically prescribed for affordable housing projects, matching funds for our building trades to leverage their own capital to build housing, and a pilot program for housing authorities to buy properties and keep them affordable long term. 
There are fully optional partnerships with neighboring housing authorities for communities that struggle to build affordable housing., The bill would also grant the  ability to redevelop vacant commercial units, as of right, into much needed urban housing in downtowns and in areas closer to the services that many people living in our community need every day. Additionally we aimed to assist our most vulnerable residents with mobile showers and laundry for homeless persons, direct cash assistance for families eligible for Rental Assistance Program (R.A.P) Vouchers and make sure there are R.A.P vouchers available for families who have students in the Open Choice Program.
In 2025 we, the governor and the legislature, nibbled around the edges and were content with the status quo ruling the day under the guise of “fiscal responsibility.” I fully endorse smart fiscal policies aimed at improving our state’s financial position, lowering our debt, and protecting our taxpayers. What I don’t agree with is that we can’t pursue a more robust and forward thinking agenda that is fiscally responsible, while still acknowledging the moment that we are in and the residents who are struggling everyday with a rising cost of living.
We create these policies to build the resources necessary to invest in all people, especially our hard-working residents. What is the point of building a rainy day fund totaling $4.1 billion when a working family can’t find decent housing that fits their budget, or a young professional has no clear path towards owning a home?
House Bill 5002 was an opportunity to show hard-working families that we have their needs at heart and a veto by Governor Lamont ensured that once again we are missing the moment.
What was a large step in a progressive direction that hard-working families need us to move in became a false flag to anyone with hopes that Connecticut will begin to address the housing crisis we face. We are 46th in the United States in building permits per capita. We have the ninth highest cost of living. Our average rent inConnecticut is $2,071, the national average is $1,761 while our average apartment size is smaller than the national average.
We cannot continue to follow this administration’s current blueprint to build a rainy day fund by any means necessary while not acknowledging that for many families in our state the rain started years ago. 
We must address the many challenges that families and hard-working residents face as the cost of living soars. Connecticut is too expensive, too constrained and too segregated, but when faced with the opportunity to take a progressive step, we missed the moment.

Multiple firefighters shot, killed while responding to North Idaho brush fire; suspect found dead

Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
The firefighters killed were identified on Monday as Battalion Chief John Morrison, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, the Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, the local newspaper reported.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
Officials found no criminal record for suspect. Investigation ongoing.
Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.

Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened
The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday night had nearly completed hand lines around the fire, the department reported.
“The fire is burning through steep terrain in timber fuels,” the Department of Lands said in a press release. “Safety remains a top priority for the crews, with an abundance of snags on site, as well as the possibility of rolling logs and falling rocks.”
The department reminded the public that it’s dangerous to fly drones while emergency personnel are responding to a wildfire.
“A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place and remains in effect over the Canfield Mountain area,” the press release said. “Unauthorized drone and aircraft pose a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities. If you fly, we can’t. For firefighter safety we also ask the public to remain clear of the Canfield Mountain area.”

The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff
Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.

The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words — please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers
Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge gave Justice Department lawyers until noon Tuesday to confirm, in writing, the administration’s plans for implementing an executive order on birthright citizenship after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted nationwide injunctions on the order Friday.
Justice Department attorney Brad Rosenberg said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt on Monday that the Trump administration does not plan to begin acting on the order — which would deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. if neither parent was a citizen — for another four weeks. That’s the grace period set in the Supreme Court’s Friday ruling.
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman was looking for more than verbal assurances.
“I want to know if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order, and who are not plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff’s organization,” Boardman said.
She ordered Rosenberg to submit in writing, by noon Tuesday, the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order. She also gave Rosenberg until next Monday to respond to the motion by immigrant parents and soon-to-be parents to turn the case into a class action lawsuit — the reason for Tuesday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Boardman and judges in two other districts in the U.S. could only block the executive order against plaintiffs that brought the respective cases, but said the district judges did not have the authority to impose nationwide injunctions.
Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban

But the ruling, as well as a concurring and a dissenting opinion, all said “that courts may award injunctive
relief beyond the named parties when the case is brought as a class action.”
So attorneys for pregnant immigrants were back in court Monday, seeking to turn the case into a class action for “all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”
That class involves thousands of babies who have been born since Feb. 19, the day President Donald Trump’s executive order was scheduled to take effect, and thousands more who will be born while the case is decided, as well as their parents, the motion said.
A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that eliminating birthright citizenship could affect up to 250,000 babies a year.
The attorneys also asked Boardman to grant a preliminary injunction against Trump’s order immediately, to prevent any harm to their clients while the requst for class certification proceeded.
“Removal is not the only irreparable harm that we’re concerned about,” said William Powell, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during Monday’s hearing. “We’re obviously also concerned about other potential ways in which the order could be enforced to deprive newborns of potential rights.”
Potential members of the class are also documenting stress and anxiety, Powell said. He shared an anecdote about a plaintiff who is experiencing a more stressful and difficult pregnancy because she fears what will happen once her child is born.
“It is confusing to them exactly what these things mean,” Powell said. “We can’t really assure them the order is fully blocked, because it’s not.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
President Donald Trump issued the order on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that citizenship does not automatically extend to everyone born in the U.S., excluding mothers who are here illegally or on a temporary visas unless the father has citizenship or is here with permanent legal resident status.
Rosenberg argued against class certification, which he said would be “prejudicial” to the government, and noted that the plaintiffs could have moved for class certification before Friday.

The law, passed by the Nebraska Legislature and signed by Gov. Jim Pillen in 2024, takes effect Tuesday.
It targets OHA, which oversees more than 2,500 dwellings and 5,000 housing vouchers for low-income residents, but came with no additional funding, the agency’s leadership noted in a statement Monday about the lawsuit filed June 27 in Douglas County District Court.

OHA asserts that the new provision — which it estimates could cost nearly $1 million annually — is unconstitutional and preempted by federal law.
Joanie Balk, OHA chief executive, said her agency is funded through federal sources that explicitly bar the use of program funds to pay legal expenses on behalf of tenants. 
She said the unfunded mandate puts the OHA “at direct odds” with federal regulations and “threatens the integrity” of its programs, as the agency is required by federal law to take action against tenants who break its rules or are engaged in criminal activity. 
 ‘Last resort’

The lawsuit says OHA would effectively be unable to bring actions to evict tenants who fail to pay rent, commit crimes or otherwise violate terms of their lease agreement.
“Our organization is fully supportive of tenants having access to legal representation and in fact they already do through the Tenant Assistance Project (TAP),” said Balk. 
TAP is run by volunteer attorneys and law students who offer free services for people who appear for eviction hearings at Douglas and Lancaster County courthouses.

Balk said the lawsuit was “a last resort” made after repeated unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue with state lawmakers and after attempts to identify resources to cover the required cost of attorney fees. 
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a frequent critic of OHA, said he wasn’t surprised by the lawsuit and said the agency was “run by horrible people.” He challenged the assertion that OHA leaders tried to resolve the issue, saying he hasn’t talked to an OHA manager since December.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha originally introduced the provision, amended into the broader Legislative Bill 840, requiring the housing authority to cover court-appointed counsel for Omahans it wants to evict. 
 Levels playing field 

Legal Aid of Nebraska applauded the new state law that guarantees legal representation for certain tenants facing eviction or lease termination. The law also covers tenants living in public housing units operated in Omaha by the Douglas County Housing Authority.

“With housing authorities regularly represented by attorneys, ensuring tenants have legal representation helps level the playing field,” Scott Mertz, director of Legal Aid’s Justice Project, said in a statement. “For many tenants, having a lawyer can mean the difference between staying housed or being evicted.
The OHA lawsuit included a statement from HUD that said the agency could not use public housing funds to pay for the court-appointed legal fees as called for in the new law. 
Earlier this year, the Legislature passed — but Pillen successfully vetoed — a McKinney-led attempt to seek potential remedies to a persistent bed bug infestation in OHA towers occupied by low-income residents.
In January, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Douglas County District Court seeking relief from the bed bugs. Former Omaha State Sen. Justin Wayne is on the legal team representing OHA plaintiffs in that lawsuit.

,California,2025-07-01 02:20:33+00:00,CalMatters,One of the biggest obstacles to building new CA housing has now vanished,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/06/ceqa-urban-development-infill-budget/,"In a legislative battle a decade in the making, lawmakers just exempted infill urban development from the California Environmental Quality Act. That’s a big deal.","In summary
In a legislative battle a decade in the making, lawmakers just exempted infill urban development from the California Environmental Quality Act. That’s a big deal.


A decade-spanning political battle between housing developers and defenders of California’s preeminent environmental law likely came to an end this afternoon with only a smattering of “no” votes. 
The forces of housing won. 
With the passage of a state budget-related housing bill, the California Environmental Quality Act will be a non-issue for a decisive swath of urban residential development in California. 
In practice, that means most new apartment buildings will no longer face the open threat of environmental litigation. 
It also means most urban developers will no longer have to study, predict and mitigate the ways that new housing might affect local traffic, air pollution, flora and fauna, noise levels, groundwater quality and objects of historic or archeological significance.
And it means that when housing advocates argue that the state isn’t doing enough to build more homes amid crippling rents and stratospheric prices, they won’t — with a few exceptions — have CEQA to blame anymore.
“Saying ‘no’ to housing in my community will no longer be state sanctioned,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who introduced the CEQA law as a separate bill in March. “This isn’t going to solve all of our housing problems in the state, but it is going to remove the single biggest impediment to building environmentally friendly housing.”
Unlike most environmental laws, which explicitly mandate, monitor or ban certain environmental behavior, CEQA is just a public disclosure requirement. The 54-year-old statute requires state and local governments to study and publicize the likely environmental impact of any decisions they make. That includes the permitting of new housing. 
But for years, the building industry and “Yes in my backyard” activists have identified the law as a key culprit behind California’s housing shortage. That’s because the law allows any individual or group to sue if they argue that a required environmental study isn’t accurate, expansive or detailed enough. Such lawsuits — and even the mere threat of them —add a degree of delay, cost and uncertainty that make it impossible for the state to build its way to affordability, CEQA’s critics argue.
With today’s vote, the Legislature will be putting that argument to the test. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spent much of last week cajoling the Legislature to pass the bill as part of his budget package, is all but certain to sign it.
Now the question is whether this monumental political and policy shift will actually result in more homes getting built in California’s cities.
Many of the bill’s backers are optimistic.
“I think when we look back on what hopefully is California finally beginning to confront this housing crisis, this year — 2025 — and this bill will be viewed as a turning point,” said Matt Haney, a Democrat who represents San Francisco in the Assembly where he chairs the housing committee.
On paper, the new law, unlike most that deal with housing approvals and environmental regulation, is actually pretty straightforward.
Urban “infill” housing developments — housing built in and around existing development — are no longer subject to CEQA.
There are some exceptions and qualifiers, but development boosters say they are relatively minor. 
The exemption is“the most significant change to the California Environmental Quality Act’s effect on housing production since CEQA was passed,” said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist for the Bay Area Council, a business coalition that regularly pushes for legislation that makes it easier to build.
The bill is limited to projects under 20 acres, but that cap is only relevant to the biggest multi-block-spanning mega developments.
A certain level of density is required, but it really only precludes using the policy for single-family home construction.
Before any project can move forward, any affiliated tribal government will have to be notified first, but the consultation is put on a short timeline.
In order to qualify for the exemption, a proposed project must also be consistent with local zoning, the regulations that determine what types of buildings can be constructed where. But thanks to another CEQA-chopping bill authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener that exempts many changes to zoning rules from CEQA and which is also packed into the budget, that appears less likely to be a real constraint. 
To buy off the ferocious opposition of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, a construction union umbrella group, the bill also includes some higher wage requirements. 
But those rules are not likely to apply to most potential residential development projects. “The lion share of housing being built” in California will no longer be governed by CEQA, said Mark Rhoades, a planning and development consultant in Berkeley.
Take a massive five-story apartment building spanning a full city block, said Bill Fulton, a longtime urban planner and professor at UC San Diego. 
“You don’t have to worry about labor and you don’t have to worry about CEQA? That’s a big deal,” he said.
CEQA seachange
What a difference nine years make.
Consider how things went back in 2016 when then-Gov. Jerry Brown tried to ram a CEQA fix for California’s rising housing costs through the state budget process. Brown’s big idea was to “streamline” the housing approval process, allowing developers to make an end-run around the California Environmental Quality Act, so long as they set aside a certain share of units for lower-income residents.
A coalition of construction labor unions, environmental interests and local government groups torched the idea. The proposal didn’t even get a vote.
Nearly a decade later, once again a Democratic governor opted to stuff a CEQA-trimming policy package through the budget process in the name of cheaper housing. 
The measure passed overwhelmingly in both the Senate and Assembly — and this time it didn’t even include an affordability requirement.

 Buffy Wicks
 Democrat, State Assembly, District 14 (Oakland)



Wicks’ proposal is somewhat narrower than the 2016 version, exempting only infill. New suburban-style subdivisions carved from farmland or undeveloped sagebrush will not qualify. 
That infill focus has made it easier for the Democratic-controlled Legislature to swallow such a significant scaling back of California’s signature environmental law. Promoting denser urban development generally means using less land, constructing new housing that uses less energy and setting up new residents to do a lot less driving. 
“When you are building housing in an existing community, that is environmentally beneficial, it is climate friendly, that is not something that should be subjected to potentially endless CEQA challenges and lawsuits,” Wiener said on the Senate floor on Monday just prior to the vote, when the measure passed 28 to 5.
Even so, Wicks’ proposal always looked like a long shot. 
Since Brown’s failed gambit, lawmakers have managed to pass a raft of bills giving housing developers an escape route around CEQA. But those laws have always contained a trade-off. Developers get to skip CEQA, but in exchange they have to pay state-set “prevailing wages” (which typically work out to union-level pay), hire union workers outright, set aside a certain share of units for lower income residents, or some combination of the three. 
These conditions were born of political necessity. A CEQA lawsuit — or even the suggestion of one — makes for a powerful negotiating tool. Organized labor groups, mostly especially the building trades council, have not been keen to give up that leverage without getting something in return.
As housing developers proved less willing to use the new streamlining laws than those bills’ sponsors and supporters had hoped, many pro-building advocates, academics and commentators began calling for environmental streamlining with no strings attached.
Wicks answered that call earlier this year. Under her proposal, infill developers would be allowed to ignore CEQA, full stop. That marked a major break from recent legislative precedent, and one that seemed a stretch, even with so many Democratic lawmakers carting around copies of Abundance.
The deal that almost wasn’t
Just last week, Wicks’ proposal seemed on the verge of collapse.
A version of the bill introduced last week included what amounted to a minor wage hike for the lowest paid construction workers, who are virtually all non-union. While the state’s carpenters’ union supported it, the trades council emphatically did not — with one of the groups’ associated lobbyists likening it to Jim Crow. The trades objected so strenuously — arguing that it set dangerous precedent and undercut apprenticeship programs — that lawmakers removed the proposed wage change. 
Instead, developers working on projects that are entirely designated to be affordable would now be required to pay prevailing wages in order to take advantage of the new law. 
Developers of any projects over 85 feet tall would be required to hire a certain share of union workers. There are added restrictions for construction in San Francisco specifically.
By the standards of prior housing streamlining bills, those are relatively modest concessions. Most developments over 85 feet use concrete and steel frame construction, which require a higher skilled labor force that is often unionized anyway.
Most entirely income-restricted housing projects make use of public subsidies that require paying union-level wages.
“Affordable housing is forced to play by different rules because the state has decided that if you are receiving public funds a certain wage should be attached to it,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, which advocates for affordable housing construction. The addition of a prevailing wage requirement for affordable housing “is a head scratcher,” he said. “But it really is reaffirming existing policy.”
That leaves every other type of housing project: Market rate and mixed-income apartment buildings under seven-or-so stories. For that type of construction, which defines the bulk of urban development in California, CEQA is soon to be entirely optional — no string attached.
That this is the new trades-endorsed deal has been met with a perplexed kind of glee from some corners of the “yes in my backyard” movement. The new version of the bill “is now *even better,*” UC Davis law professor Chris Elmendorf marveled on Twitter.
Will it matter?
What will urban housing construction look like in California without CEQA?
There are no shortage of reasons not to build housing in California. Labor costs, even without regulatory requirements, are high. So are interest rates. Tariffs and aggressive immigration enforcement are more recent sources of uncertainty. Developers are always happy to complain about slow permitting, high local fees and inflexible building codes. 
“It’s not the CEQA costs that are holding up housing,” said Rhoades, the Berkeley consultant. 
“I don’t think this is going to make more development happen,” he said of the budget bill. “It’s going to make development that is already happening a little easier.”
Critics of the law can and do point to specific projects — housing for students, housing near public transit, affordable housing built upon city-owned parking lots — that have been sued in the name of the environment as examples of “CEQA abuse.”
Under the new laws, such litigation will largely go away in California’s cities.
“The one thing we do know is that CEQA is a time suck,” said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation and the former head of the state’s housing agency under Brown. “If you can just get out of that six months, nine months, twelfth months of delay, that takes a whole cohort of projects and gets them in the ground sooner. In a state that’s facing a housing crisis, that’s not for nothing.”
But the more important consequence of CEQA, many of its critics regularly argue, has been its chilling effect. 
How many new units of housing would have been built, but for concerns that they might become ensnared in environmental litigation? How many developers, anticipating a possible legal challenge, have preemptively pared back their plans? How many financiers of housing projects pulled out or demanded higher interest rates over such concerns?

The move, fast-tracked under pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom, sparked fierce pushback from environmental, community and labor groups.","In summary
Major changes to the California Environmental Quality Act include an exemption for high-tech industrial plants and other projects. The move, fast-tracked under pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom, sparked fierce pushback from environmental, community and labor groups.



California lawmakers today approved one of the most substantial rollbacks of the state’s signature environmental review law in decades, including a controversial exemption that would allow high-tech manufacturing plants to be built in industrial zones with no environmental review.
The changes to the California Environmental Quality Act were embedded in a last-minute budget bill that sailed through the Senate and the Assembly. The new law exempts nine types of projects from environmental reviews: child care centers, health clinics, food banks, farmworker housing, broadband, wildfire prevention, water infrastructure, public parks or trails and, notably, advanced manufacturing.
Aiming to streamline and lower the cost of construction in California, the new law also restricts legal challenges under CEQA by narrowing which documents courts can consider. It also allows limited environmental reviews of projects that don’ t have an array of impacts. 
The changes in the 54-year-old law were forced by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who told legislators last week that he would not approve the state’s $321 billion spending plan without them. A provision in the budget act approved last week stated the spending plan “shall be inoperative and repealed” if changes to the state’s environmental review process were not final by midnight tonight.
Newsom signed the bill tonight, after it passed with overwhelming votes in the Senate and Assembly.
For decades, business and building groups have railed against what they call “CEQA abuse,” saying the environmental reviews drag out projects for years. But supporters say the law requires developers and others to examine and correct an array of environmental impacts, from air pollution to water use to traffic.
Recently, with climate change front and center, some liberals have joined calls for overhauling the environmental law, arguing that California must build faster and at scale to decarbonize its electric grid and construct housing and transportation systems.
The new exemption for “advanced manufacturing” facilities in areas already zoned for industrial use — including plants that build semiconductors and nanotech — drew some of the fiercest criticism. State law defines the category as processes that improve or create new materials, products or technologies. 
The changes were met with vehement opposition from more than 100 environmental and community groups, which said industrial plants will be more easily built in low-income communities. They also say the exemptions will advantage developers by limiting public oversight and could create legal confusion.
“This bill is the worst anti-environmental bill in California in recent memory,” a coalition of opponents, including the California Environmental Justice Alliance and the Western Center on Law and Poverty, wrote in a letter to Newsom and legislators.
“This law would not harm all California communities equally. This budget deal is an attack on lower-income communities of color that consistently get sited for harmful industrial projects.”ASHA SHARMA, LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
At the over three-hour hearing preceding the vote, dozens of members of the public spoke in opposition, with some holding signs saying “When CEQA is silenced, polluters speak louder.”  
Asha Sharma, state policy manager with Leadership Council for Justice and Accountability, called the changes “a back-room, last-minute deal” that made the state budget “dependent on gutting environmental review for resource-intensive and polluting industrial projects.”
“This law would not harm all California communities equally,” Sharma said. “This budget deal is an attack on lower-income communities of color that consistently get sited for harmful industrial projects.”
The Assembly approved the bill with a 50 to 3 vote, and the Senate, 33 to 1. 
Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance who voted against it, raised concerns on the Assembly floor about the bill’s exemption for advanced manufacturing plants, citing the environmental opposition and urged the measure to be revisited. 
The lone senator to stand against it was Republican Roger Niello from Roseville. However, several who voiced concerns about the bill in an earlier hearing today did not vote, including Democratic state Sen. Catherine Blakespear from Encinitas and Sen. John Laird from Santa Cruz. 
Newsom said his budget maneuver was necessary and thanked the leaders of the two houses of the Legislature.
“This was too important to play chance. It was too urgent, too important to allow the (legislative) process to unfold as it has for the last generation, invariably falling prey to all kinds of pratfall,” Newsom said.
The governor’s public comments were limited as the fierce debate broke out in recent days. But his press office account posted on social media last week that “the Legislature has a chance to deliver the most significant housing and infrastructure reforms in decades.”
“This is our moment to build the California Dream for a new generation,” his office said. “We’re done with the roadblocks and delays — let’s get this done.”
“This is a bill that, literally, will help us get more housing, more childcare centers, more health centers, more food banks, and bring clean advanced manufacturing to California.”STATE SEN. SCOTT WIENER
A major proponent of the exemptions, State Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said in an interview with CalMatters today that criticisms by environmentalists were  “extreme, unfounded, melodramatic statements.” 
“This is a bill that, literally, will help us get more housing, more childcare centers, more health centers, more food banks, and bring clean advanced manufacturing to California,” Wiener said. “And to suggest that that kind of bill is bad for the environment — or the worst environmental bill in decades — or whatever it is they said, that’s just over the top.”
Wiener said the changes exempt manufacturing projects only on land that is already zoned as industrial. The goal is to make it easier for high-tech industries to build, with Wiener arguing that California risks losing out on major private-sector investment because it’s too costly and difficult to build in the state. 
“The environmental movement needs to ask itself: Why is it that CEQA keeps getting used to stymie climate action, whether it’s transit-oriented development or bike lanes or public transportation or phasing out oil?” Wiener said.
Several housing advocacy and business groups voiced support for the law today.  
Alex Torres, speaking on behalf of housing groups, the tech trade association Chamber of Progress, the Bay Area Council and others, said exempting advanced manufacturing from environmental review will help “the Bay Area’s competitiveness” and “shift some manufacturing opportunities to the Bay Area.” 
Several other manufacturing groups declined to comment to CalMatters about the law changes or did not respond to inquiries. 
‘Shortcutting’ legislative process
The debate today in the committee hearing included a testy exchange between senators about whether Newsom was forcing their hand. 
“We have a situation here where the executive branch is telling the Legislative branch that if it doesn’t pass this trailer bill, that the budget itself will be null and void. I have to say, that profoundly disturbs and offends me,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican from Roseville, said at today’s hearing. 
Wiener fired back that all aspects of the budget and trailer bills were a three-party agreement. “We don’t have a dictatorship,” he said. 
“I wasn’t part of that three-party agreement,” Niello countered. 
Environmental and community groups also questioned the use of the budget to shortcut the legislative process, limiting public and legislative input.
“If the only way you can change state law is to keep it out of the public eye as long as possible, and condition passage of the state budget on the proposed changes, does that not show that its backers know the public wouldn’t support it if they knew the truth?” the coalition of opponents wrote to Newsom and legislators.
California lawmakers enacted CEQA in 1970 amid a rising tide of environmental awareness. It had broad bipartisan support: Gov. Ronald Reagan signed it into law, and President Richard Nixon approved its federal counterpart the same year. At the time, environmental concerns were mostly local — unchecked development, polluted waterways, pesticide use and the loss of open space.
Two years ago, in another effort to use the state budget process as leverage, Newsom proposed a series of last-minute changes to the law. That move was rejected by lawmakers.
But after years of failed attempts to rewrite the law, Democrats have begun to rally around a new message: The political conversation among Democrats in Sacramento, and across the U.S., has shifted following last year’s presidential election, with growing consensus that removing regulatory barriers is a top priority.
Still, just hours before their vote, lawmakers were grappling with how exactly the bill would affect communities on the frontlines of manufacturing, with Wiener fielding most of the questions. 
State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys, asked about the definition of “advanced manufacturing.” Laird, a Democrat from Santa Cruz, asked whether it included nuclear materials. Wiener said it did not. 
“It is a horrible day when a senator even has to ask if an exemption from environmental review includes nuclear manufacturing,” said Sharma, of the justice and accountability organization.
At the earlier committee hearing, State Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles, cited the massive cleanup of lead-contaminated soil around the battery recycling facility Exide Technologies in Vernon as a warning of the risk. 
“I don’t believe anyone here thinks that we use CEQA in any way other than to protect ourselves. The toxins…can leach into neighborhoods and devastate full communities.”RAQUEL MASON, CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE
Raquel Mason, senior legislative manager with the California Environmental Justice Alliance, told senators that there have been 23 Superfund sites in Santa Clara County — in the heart of Silicon Valley, and several are related to semiconductor manufacturing. 
“I don’t believe anyone here thinks that we use CEQA in any way other than to protect ourselves,” Mason said. “The toxins don’t just stay in the industrial zone facility. They can leach into neighborhoods and devastate full communities.”
Major labor group opposed to the CEQA changes
Samuel Appel, policy director at the United Auto Workers in the Western United States, which represents 100,000 workers in California, said the exemption for advanced manufacturing was especially alarming because of California’s position as a leader in the tech industry. 
“We’re concerned not only about toxic work sites that our members will be working at and organizing in. We’re concerned about the toxic communities that we’d be living in,” Appel said. “We are organizing and work in these facilities every day — at Tesla, in semiconductor facilities and in lithium and the lithium extraction industry and in aerospace. This is a giveaway for corporations, and city and local control is not enough to protect us or our communities.” 
A new law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022 offers $280 billion in federal initiative aimed at boosting U.S. innovation and manufacturing in strategic technologies, especially semiconductors. The law allocates ubsidies and tax credits to incentivize companies to manufacture chips in the United States, rather than overseas.
Semiconductors are the tiny processors that power everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to fighter jets and satellites — and demand for them is growing. The pandemic exposed major vulnerabilities in global supply chains, spurring bipartisan momentum to reinvigorate chip production.
Arizona, Texas and Ohio have landed many new chip fabrication plants, in part because of lower costs and fewer regulatory hurdles. That’s why some lawmakers, including Wiener say environmental streamlining is needed if California wants to attract a significant share of manufacturing dollars.
“These are jobs of the future, there’s going to be more and more of these jobs, and I want them to be in California,” Wiener told CalMatters. “We do so much of the innovation here and the creation of this technology. I want us to benefit from the technology in terms of growth and job creation here and so, you know, I think this is a reasonable bill. 
The measures lets certain projects skip a full environmental review if they just barely miss qualifying for an exemption — for example, if they meet every requirement except one. In those cases, the review would only look at the environmental impact of that one issue, instead of analyzing the whole project. Critics say it’s confusing and could weaken protections by letting potentially harmful projects avoid deeper scrutiny.
“We find the near-miss provisions to be extremely legally confusing,” said Matthew Baker, policy director at the Planning and Conservation League. “It would take a lot, probably, for the courts to sort out. We simply don’t really understand how it would work.”
Under CEQA, lawsuits challenging a project require the agency to provide a full record — including internal emails and staff notes — but the changes exclude those internal communications from the record, except for projects involving distribution centers or oil and gas infrastructure. Critics said that will make it harder to challenge potentially harmful projects.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/032311_Semiconductor_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 22:59:05.824575

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Five and a half weeks after a fire ravaged the Matunuck Oyster Bar, the popular South Kingstown restaurant reopened Monday thanks to a revision of Rhode Island’s outdoor dining law.  
Gov. Dan McKee signed legislation amending the state’s “Take It Outside” law at a ceremony under a tent diagonally across Succotash Road from the damaged restaurant. Tables topped with flowers and chairs were arranged on a wooden floor in the tented area where al fresco dining can take place this summer in what was the restaurant’s valet parking lot. Food is prepared in a mobile kitchen trailer.
The legislation sponsored by South Kingstown Democrats, Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee and Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski was approved unanimously by both chambers of the General Assembly on June 12, a week after they were introduced. The revised law allows restaurants damaged by fire or flood to offer temporary outdoor dining for up to 18 months, as long as they receive approval from municipal officials and meet health and safety regulations. 
At the time of the May 20 fire, the Matunuck Oyster Bar employed about 300 workers. The restaurant can keep roughly 50 restaurant employees working this summer because of the revised law, officials said. The restaurant will be open daily and offer takeout service in addition to dining under the tent.
“Rhode Island may be small, but we always rally around our own,” McKee said in a statement. “I want to thank our state and local leaders who acted quickly to make this possible and to everyone who rallied around a beloved local business when it needed it the most.” 
A GoFundMe page has raised over $260,000 to help the restaurant rebuild and help employees
“The fire made me realize more than ever the importance of community,” Perry Raso, the restaurant’s owner, said during Monday’s speaking program.
The Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal is still investigating the cause of the fire but preliminary findings suggested the blaze was likely accidental in nature.

More investment in renewables will help lower Alaska's high energy costs, but the budget bill that Congress is debating would reduce renewable investments. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans pay nearly the highest percentage of their household incomes on energy of any state, and federal policy changes proposed in the budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in the U.S. Senate would make the problem worse, according to a report by the University of Washington’s Center for Environmental Health Equity and three Alaska organizations.
The report found that Alaska’s energy burden — the percentage of household income that is spent on energy — is the nation’s second highest, at 4.3% compared to a national average of 2.7%. Maine has the highest average energy cost burden, at 4.5%, according to the report’s authors.
The disparities between cost burdens in urban and rural Alaska are stark, the report said. Outside of urban areas like Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, where the median costs amount to 2.3% of household income, the cost burden in rural Alaska is considered severe, the report found.
In Southwest Alaska, the residents spend an average of 12% of their household income on energy. In northern Alaska, the burden is 8.3%, according to the report, titled “Energy Burden in Alaska: Understanding Energy Burden for Alaska Communities and Charting a Path Forward.”
Along with UW’s Center for Environmental Health Equity, other organizations writing the report were Cook Inletkeeper, the Alaska Public Interest Research Group and Native Movement.
In written statements, representatives of the Alaska organizations said provisions in the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” would further burden state residents, especially in rural areas.
“This report contains very timely information,” said Ben Boettger, energy policy analyst for Cook Inletkeeper. “The U.S. Senate is considering legislation that would weaken and then eliminate energy tax credits — namely the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit, threatened by the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ — that until recently weren’t available to the cooperative and municipal utilities that serve most rural Alaskans. We hope Alaska’s senators will bear in mind these extreme energy disparities as they consider where they stand in upcoming debates and votes on tax credit changes.”
The report makes a series of policy recommendations, but the proposals in the bill would make changes in the opposite direction.
The report recommends increased investment in renewable energy projects, notably in the highest-cost areas of rural Alaska. “Long term, bringing on community-scale renewable energy, especially for communities dependent on fly-in and barge-in diesel is the best and most accessible way to reduce energy burdens and support thriving communities,” the report said.
But the bill proposes to do the opposite by ending tax credits for clean energy projects and imposing new taxes on wind and solar projects. And even Elon Musk, once a close Trump adviser, has criticized those elements of the bill.
Already, more than $14 billion in clean energy projects have been eliminated this year because of Trump administration policies, according to one new analysis.
The Alaska report recommends expanding the weatherization program that helps homeowners achieve energy efficiency. Outside of the bill, the Trump administration is also seeking to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP.
Other recommendations of the Alaska report focus on state policy. Among the steps that it said should be taken at the state level is an expansion of Alaska’s Power Equalization Program, which subsidizes rural electricity. Other recommended state-level policies include full funding of the Alaska Renewable Energy Fund and more administrative support for the state’s new Green Bank, the report said.
If tax credits for clean energy are eliminated, consumers across the nation will face higher costs, according to a new report from one national organization.
The Clean Energy Buyers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based industry group, calculated costs of the credit elimination in 28 states, including Alaska.
For Alaska, the end to the tax credits will mean 600 fewer jobs, an average $170-per-household loss in income, a 0.8% increase in household electricity prices, a 0.9% increase in business electricity prices, a 2.5% increase in household natural gas prices and a 4.3% increase in businesses’ natural gas prices, according to the organization’s analysis.
It would also cause an overall $50 million decrease in state gross domestic product. Alaska’s gross domestic product growth rate currently ranks second-to-last among the U.S. states.

On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may proceed with the implementation of his order in more than half of U.S. states.
Anchorage immigration attorney Margaret Stock noted over the weekend that when it comes to Alaska and Hawaii, the federal government would have to overcome special, state-specific laws if it wants to cancel birthright citizenship.
For Alaska, a federal law passed in 1952 states specifically that “A person born in Alaska on or after March 30, 1867, … is a citizen of the United States at birth.”
The same law, elsewhere, states that “A person born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, is a citizen of the United States at birth.”
No other state has a specific law establishing birthright citizenship there.
Stock said she believes those laws protect the citizenship of children born in Alaska and Hawaii, but added that she has seen the federal government violate other immigration laws.

Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tom Tillis of North Carolina have indicated that they will vote against it. If Murkowski were to join them in opposition, it would leave Vice President J.D. Vance to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor. 
If one other Republican were to also vote no, the bill would fail.
Senators are rushing to finish work ahead of the Fourth of July, an informal deadline preferred by the president.
In order to partially pay for tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, the bill proposes significant cuts to Medicaid spending and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps.
Roughly 1 in 3 Alaskans receives health care through Medicaid, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank opposed to the big bill, estimated that 35,000 Alaskans could lose health insurance if the bill passes. 
Republicans proposed $6.7 billion in additional Medicaid spending for Alaska to offset some of those cuts, but over the weekend, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that change violated the rules of the budget procedure being used to advance the bill.
Large numbers of Alaskans receive SNAP food aid from the federal government, and the bill would require states to pay for a share of that aid, which is currently fully funded by the federal government.
Alaska, which has repeatedly been scolded by the federal government for mistakes managing SNAP, would be required to pay as much as $37 million per year to keep food aid steady, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated. 
Republican senators inserted a provision into the bill that would have temporarily exempted Alaska and Hawaii from having to pay into the program, but on Monday, the Senate parliamentarian seemed likely to nix that benefit as well.
In a weekend opinion column published in the New York Times, Alaska Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and Alaska Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, urged Congress to reject the bill, saying it would be bad for Alaska. By phone on Monday, Giessel said her view had not changed since that column was published.
Other parts of the bill, geared toward Alaska, remained intact: a new tax exemption for Community Development Quota fishing groups and an increase in a federal tax deduction for Alaska whaling captains.
The bill contains more than $7 billion for Coast Guard icebreakers and $300 million to homeport a newly purchased civilian icebreaker commissioned into Coast Guard service. That icebreaker is slated to be homeported in Juneau.
On Monday, Murkowski was working to amend a section of the bill that threatens to deter low-cost solar and wind power projects that could reduce energy costs in Alaska.
Currently, federal law provides tax credits that incentivize those projects, but the new bill would eliminate those credits.
In addition, as of Monday afternoon, the bill contained a new excise tax on solar and energy projects placed into service after 2027 if they use parts from China and other prohibited foreign countries.
Almost all solar and wind projects use Chinese components because of their low cost and high quality.
Murkowski was seeking a gradual phaseout of those tax credits by allowing projects to collect them as long as they begin construction by 2027.

It mandates four new oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it requires other sales in Cook Inlet and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. 
Seventy percent of rental and royalty payments from those sales would go to the state of Alaska, starting in 2034, up from 50 percent currently.
That’s down from a proposed share of 90%, which was in an earlier Senate version of the bill. 
The revenue sharing is particularly important for the state because a growing proportion of North Slope oil production is coming from federal land, rather than state land, and most promising new oil finds in the North Slope are on federal land.
An earlier version of the bill proposed to ban states for 10 years from passing laws restricting AI computer software development. That’s now down to five years and has multiple exceptions.
In the Alaska Legislature, Anchorage Reps. Alyse Galvin and Andrew Gray had issued a statement asking the Senate to reconsider the 10-year ban.
A provision advancing development of the Ambler Road was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah has withdrawn a proposal to sell large amounts of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land.
Overall, independent analysts have found, the tax cuts within the bill will bring increased financial benefits for the wealthiest Alaskans, while the poorest Alaskans will be left worse off because their tax cuts do not equal the cost of lost federal benefits and services.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a Sunday estimate that the bill will increase the federal debt by more than $3.2 trillion over 10 years.
If the bill advances through the Senate, it will be subject to a vote in the House, where lawmakers passed a different version earlier this year.
That vote could come before the Fourth of July holiday.

Congressman Dwight Evans won’t seek reelection in 2026, announces plans to retire",John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/pa-congressman-dwight-evans-wont-seek-reelection-in-2026-announces-plans-to-retire/,Multiple Democratic lawmakers have expressed interest in potentially joining the race to succeed him.,"U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) announced on Monday that he will not run for reelection in 2026.
“After some discussions this weekend and thoughtful reflection, I have decided that the time is right to announce that I will not be seeking re-election in 2026,” he said. “Serving the people of Philadelphia has been the honor of my life. I am deeply proud of what I have been able to accomplish over my 45 years in elected office — from revitalizing neighborhoods block by block to fighting for justice, economic opportunity, investments in infrastructure and education.”
“I cannot express the gratitude that I have for the trust that voters put in me as their voice in both state and federal office,” he added. “It has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve as their advocate in government.”
In May 2024, Evans suffered a stroke and did not vote for several months during his recovery. He was reelected to another term last year.  In his statement, Evans said that he is in “good health and fully capable of continuing to serve.”  He intends to serve the remainder of his current term that ends on Jan. 3, 2027.
Evans career in elected office spans several decades. He served in Pennsylvania’s General Assembly for multiple decades before he defeated indicted incumbent Congressman Chaka Fattah in the Democratic Party primary in 2016 to win a seat in the U.S. House.
He has cruised to reelection four times and represents a safe Democratic district, according to national ratings outlets.
Evans is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, where he serves on the Subcommittees on Health, and Worker and Family Support.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in December that multiple Democrats would be interested in running for the seat, if Evans decided to not seek reelection in 2026. A few confirmed interest in the seat following Evans announcement. Earlier this year, Evans’ first quarter fundraising total, was the lowest in the state’s congressional delegation.
State Sen. Sharif Street, who also serves as the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party, said “We’ll be filing paperwork tomorrow that will answer that question.”
State Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) previously set up an exploratory committee for the seat in October 2023, but decided against challenging Evans.
“I had no intention of running against the congressman, but now that he has announced that he’s not running for re-election. I’m seriously considering it,” Rabb told the Capital-Star on Monday.
State Rep. Morgan Cephas, who serves as the chair of the Philadelphia caucus in the state House, told POLITICO on Monday that “me and my team are strongly considering a bid.”
Dave Oxman, a physician, and Robin Toldens, who the Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, are both Democrats who have already filed to run for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District

For the first time in a decade, we have a chance to write a new roadmap that should include eliminating combined sewage overflows.
The post It’s time to give the Mystic River watershed the same clean-up we gave Boston Harbor appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","NESTLED ON THE border of Cambridge and Arlington, the Alewife Brook Reservation is a serene urban wildland filled with wetlands, teeming with wildlife, and a popular oasis for residents. But it’s also the site where more than 1.6 million gallons of untreated sewage overflow — including human waste — have been dumped since the start of 2025. 
Despite tremendous progress made over the last 50 years to improve water quality throughout Greater Boston, outdated sewer infrastructure and underregulated stormwater practices continue to lead to the discharge of dangerous pollutants directly into our popular public waterways. A disproportionate number of the most egregious discharges, known as combined sewage overflows (CSOs), occur at Alewife Brook and along the Mystic River, a watershed region home to roughly 600,000 people. This poses a significant threat to their health and well-being, as well as that of critical ecosystems throughout the region.  
Fortunately, in 2025, we have an unprecedented opportunity to tackle this enduring challenge, which dates back to the cleanup of Boston Harbor, which began in the 1980s. 
For the first time in a decade, we have a chance to take what we’ve learned about improving water quality and rewrite a roadmap that should include eliminating CSOs altogether, establishing foundational strategies to protect our waterways, and promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, public health, and ecological health. If we miss this chance, we risk missing a crucial window for making the water our residents and neighbors recreate in and live alongside safe for everyone to enjoy for decades to come.

Constructed in the late 1800s, combined sewer overflows were designed as a connected sewer and storm drain system to ferry untreated wastewater and storm runoff into treatment plants. Today, these same pipes carry that mix of rainwater and sewage in the Boston area to the water treatment plant at Deer Island, during small rain events.  
When hit with moderate to severe rainfall events, however, these systems become overwhelmed, and — to prevent sewage from backing up into homes — divert untreated wastewater to outflows along our rivers and streams. These outflows expose communities to dangerous bacteria and other pollutants linked to severe health complications, and necessitate the all-too-frequent closure of local waterways, parks, and beaches.  
Unfortunately, incidents of discharges have become more common. As cities have grown and shifting rain patterns caused by climate change have brought heavier, more frequent precipitation events, our antiquated sewer system has struggled to keep up. Toxic water increasingly has no place to go but into areas where we work, play, and live.  
Indeed, even while dozens of CSO outflows in Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville have been eliminated over the past 35 years, over 100 million gallons of raw and partially treated combined sewage were discharged into the Mystic River and its tributaries in 2024 alone. In the recently published Mystic River water quality report card, one of these tributaries, the Alewife Brook,  scored an alarming D+.  
This year, an update to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Combined Sewer Overflow Long Term Control Plan, which creates a 10-year framework for MWRA, local governments, and institutions to address the remaining combined sewer overflows impacting the Mystic, Neponset, and Charles rivers, as well as Alewife Brook, is well underway and set to be finalized and rolled out over the coming months.  
Combined with federal regulatory changes, the plan is in a position to substantially improve public health throughout Greater Boston and accelerate the progress made thus far in improving the water quality in the Mystic River watershed and the region. However, to be truly effective in ensuring our waterways are clean and safe from hazardous waste, the overriding priority of the plan must be to eliminate the discharge of sewage from combined sewer overflows completely.  
To accomplish this, any long-term control plan must be flexible and responsive to our rapidly changing climate, incorporating climate-ready solutions that prepare our cities for the heavy rain and snow events we can expect over the next decade. This means considering, whenever possible, green infrastructure solutions, such as rain gardens, bioswales, and stormwater wetlands, that provide co-benefits to communities most impacted by CSO discharges. 
Executing the long-term control plan must also be a collective effort involving municipalities, community groups, policy-makers, engineers, and the public. Transparency must be woven throughout the 10-year process — and this year’s negotiations — ensuring that infrastructure proposals are accessible to all and multiple opportunities are provided for the public to deliberate, share feedback, and react to proposals.  
Together, these essential investments in infrastructure and planning present a massive opportunity to modernize our infrastructure and better protect our waterways to reflect and serve everyone in our communities. We can no longer afford to kick these urgently needed updates down the road.  
In the 1980s, Massachusetts embarked on a massive operation to clean up Boston Harbor. Today, we are reaping the benefits of that effort — proving that we can innovate to tackle big infrastructure challenges with massive and long-term payoffs for the public good.  
We now find ourselves at another pivotal moment in the quest to improve water quality. It’s time to step up, eliminate CSOs, and implement a sustainable, long-term plan to protect the Mystic River and Alewife Brook, so that residents living along these waterways will have access to clean, healthy water now and into the future.

Part Emergency Communications drill and part informal competition, amateur radio Field Day encourages ham radio operators across the U.S. and Canada to test their equipment and skills.

Kelsey Tolchin-Kupferer is the audio story editor at the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship, in partnership with Vermont Public. 

Radio waves were flying in Essex Junction this weekend as members of Radio Amateurs of Northern Vermont joined tens of thousands of amateur — or “ham” — radio operators across North America for Field Day.
Hosted annually by the National Association for Amateur Radio, Field Day encourages licensed operators to test their skills, equipment and emergency readiness. It’s also a chance for “hams” to socialize, recruit new operators and engage in some friendly competition.
Here’s how it works:
Amateur radio operators set up temporary radio stations in remote areas like parks, parking lots and fields. They then spend 24 hours trying to make contact with as many other stations as possible using only portable equipment and emergency power like batteries and generators.

Members of Radio Amateurs of Northern Vermont (RANV) have been participating in Field Day for more than 30 years.
“We take it extremely seriously, because the whole point of Field Day is to do an emergency communications — ‘EmComm’ — setup,” said RANV president Stewart Corey. “And it doesn’t get any more EmComm than what we’re doing.”
RANV’s setup is ambitious, with three 50-foot antenna towers and multiple stations running on generators. It takes several hours and several volunteers to assemble — and tear down — all the gear.
Still, RANV members say the real magic of amateur radio is how little it takes to connect.
“If you give me the right radio and a 12-volt battery and enough wire to string in the trees, I can talk to anywhere in the world,” said RANV member John Colt.
Colt uses his amateur radio know-how to help organize emergency communications drills at healthcare facilities across Vermont. He says when cell towers fail, the internet is down and the power goes out, ham radio operators can still get messages through.
“If you want something that will work when nothing else does, that’s amateur radio,” he said.
But emergency preparedness is only part of the appeal.
“It’s also an incredibly fun hobby,” Colt said.
Fellow RANV member Erik Wheeler agrees. He got his amateur license as a kid. 
“I walked into my teacher’s classroom — it was Travis Redman, a fantastic teacher at Rutland Town School — and there was a ham radio sitting there,” Wheeler said. “He taught me and several other students how to use it, and I’ve been hooked ever since.”

This year, Vermonters set up Field Day stations in Shaftsbury, Montpelier, Halifax, Newport, New Haven and Gateway in addition to the one in Essex Junction. Many stations encouraged members of the public to come and observe — and even get on the air.
Field Day is also an informal competition. Groups earn points for the number of stations they contact — called “QSOs” — and can earn bonus points for things like getting little kids on the air. 
RANV has placed first in the nation in its Field Day category for four years in a row. RANV operators log hundreds of contacts every hour, consistently outperforming hundreds of other ham radio clubs across the U.S. and Canada.
RANV president Stewart Corey says the club does so well because they’ve got great equipment and a dedicated team on-air for the full 24 hours. And, he said, Vermont’s location helps. 
“Because we’re up in the corner, we can face our beam southwest and hit a majority of the United States without moving it,” he said. “Geographically, we kind of get to cheat.”
Curious about ham radio? You don’t have to wait till next Field Day. Corey says RANV is always looking for new members. They meet monthly in Essex Junction.

(Screenshot of video from Spokane Valley Fire Department)Law enforcement on Monday identified the man who they believe killed two firefighters attempting to battle a brush fire in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene.
Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
The firefighters killed were identified on Monday as battalion chief John Morrison, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and battalion chief Frank Harwood, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, the Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, the local newspaper reported.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
 Investigation ongoing

Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.
 Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday are trying to reduce the fire’s growth by building a fireline. Structures aren’t threatened, and the fire hasn’t prompted evacuations, Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Fighting the fire is slow because the terrain makes it difficult to use ground assets, Norris said.
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
 Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff

Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff. 
The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words—please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
The victims’ names will be released by local officials in due time, the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
 In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers

Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)The state of Utah is suing Snapchat over features it says are designed to addict children, while potentially exposing them to illegal drug sales, predatory adults and an artificial intelligence feature that has “known risks.”
That’s according to a complaint filed on Monday in Salt Lake County’s 3rd District Court, accusing the popular social media app of violating Utah’s Consumer Sales Practices and Consumer Privacy acts. 
It’s the latest attempt by Utah to target the legality of how social media companies interact with minors — the state has now filed four lawsuits against major social media companies, including similar complaints against Meta and TikTok. 
However, Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) is accusing the state of trying to circumvent a court ruling last year that put a temporary hold on a Utah law requiring age verification for social media users. The company says it’s not against increased safety regulations, but called Utah’s demands “unconstitutional.” 
Allegations of criminal activity and ‘gambling-like features’ 
In the 90-page complaint, attorneys for the state claim Snapchat leaves children vulnerable to exploitation, misleads parents into thinking the app is safe, and has “gambling-like” features that reward continuous use and compulsive scrolling. 
The complaint cites examples where Snapchat’s artificial intelligence chatbot, My AI, was allegedly “giving a 13-year-old account advice on setting the mood for a sexual experience with a 31-year-old.” The attorney general’s office also gives several examples of drug deals and sex crimes involving Snapchat.
The complaint accuses Snapchat of knowingly incorporating and refining features that “facilitate, enable, and promote the distribution of drugs and sexual exploitation,” a violation of the state’s consumer sales practices act.   
According to the complaint, Snap incorporates features that are “designed to be addictive to children,” including push notifications, beauty filters, personalized algorithms and the My AI chatbot. Meanwhile, the company hides or disincentivizes features that could decrease the time young people spend on the app, the lawsuit claims. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Addicting children and “ensuring their continued addiction” is also in violation of the state’s consumer sales practices act, the complaint reads — as is launching the My AI feature that had “known risks to drive engagement and profit.”
The state argues Snapchat is violating the Utah Consumer Privacy Act by failing to provide customers with the “ability to opt out of the sensitive data collected through Snapchat’s My AI feature.” 
According to the lawsuit, Snap was informed of these violations in a May 2025 letter, but the company “did not cure any of the violations.” Utah is hoping a court will force Snap to follow the laws it claims the company is violating, and order restitution and other civil penalties. 
“Utah is taking a stand to protect our kids in an increasingly digital world. This lawsuit against Snap is about accountability and about drawing a clear line: the well-being of our children must come before corporate profits,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in a statement Monday. “We won’t sit back while tech companies exploit young users. It’s time for commonsense protections that ensure a safer online experience for every minor.”
Snapchat says Utah is trying to circumvent a prior court ruling 
In a statement, Snap said the company is committed to making the app a “safe and fun environment for our community, and have built privacy and safety features into our service from the start.”   
Utah changed its social media laws to avoid constitutional issues, but legal challenges persist

The lawsuit comes about a year after Utah lawmakers passed a bill requiring social media companies verify the age of their users. NetChoice, a trade association for internet companies like Google, Meta and Snap, sued the state, arguing the law violated the First Amendment — in September, a judge temporarily blocked the law from going into effect. 
Now Snap is accusing the state of trying to find a way around the court ruling. 
“Unable to accept the court’s rejection of the state’s legislation, the Utah Attorney General is resorting to civil litigation as a means to circumvent the court and impose age verification requirements and age-related restrictions in ways that are unconstitutional,” a company spokesperson said in an email.  
Snap said Utah’s lawsuit imposes restrictive and “technologically unfeasible” regulations that stifle free speech. 
Billions of conversations take place on Snapchat each day, the vast majority of them to simply connect with friends and family, according to the company. Snap said it supports steps to increase online safety for children, including the recently-passed SB142, which requires Apple and Google’s app stores to verify a user’s age before making downloads. 
The company also pointed to safety features that make teen accounts and friend lists private by default, and require a Snapchat user to be “friends” with someone before they can communicate with them. Other features allow parents to see who their child is talking to and who their friends are.

A New York federal judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction last week that allows Job Corps centers, like the Northlands Job Corps Center in Vergennes, to remain open while the legal battle to determine their fate continues.
In issuing the order, Judge Andrew Lamar Carter, a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, stated that the arguments by lawyers for National Job Corps Association and a litany of fellow defendants — ranging from Education and Training Resources, the contractor who operates the Job Corps in Vergennes, to current Job Corps students — were largely likely to succeed. The plaintiffs all sued the U.S. Department of Labor to stop its attempt to shut down the program.
In late May, the Department of Labor told Job Corps centers across the country to “pause” all of their operations. This order would have forced Job Corps center to shut down a program that provides room, food and a vocational education to low income 16 to 24 year olds by Monday, June 30.

Instead, the department’s order would have instated what the administration characterized as a “cost-effective” $2.9 billion “Make America Skilled Again” grant program that shifts from federal programs like Job Corps to state-led registered apprenticeships, intended to train workers and provide an alternative to college.
The Job Corps centers had already been funded from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 by Congress, which previously approved $1.7 billion for the program. 
The plaintiffs in the case argued that the Department of Labor “effectively prevented new enrollment” by ending background checks starting in March, court documents show. Students attending Job Corps need to be background-checked to attend the program, but it is unclear now whether or not the government intends to resume background checks, or if they can be legally compelled to do so.The Department of Labor claimed that they had only temporarily halted Job Corps operations. However, Carter wrote in his order that the “way that the DOL is shuttering operations and the context in which the shuttering is taking place make it clear that the DOL is actually attempting to close the centers.”Carter also found that the Department of Labor did not have the power to end the program, writing that the department must “concede that, as part of the executive branch, they do not have the authority to unilaterally eliminate a congressionally mandated program like Job Corps.”Carter also stated that there were clear harms in ending the programs, citing the circumstances of a plaintiff who is a student with the Job Corps program who was previously homeless.The plaintiff “will immediately be plunged into homelessness, and she will lose all of the progress she has made in her culinary program. She would be forced to leave a stable residence and placed in a homeless shelter,” he wrote. It is “undisputed,” he wrote, that she was being harmed by the department’s actions.“The Department of Labor is working closely with the Department of Justice to evaluate the injunction. We remain confident that our actions are consistent with the law,” Ryan L. Honick, a spokesperson for the Department of Labor wrote in an email.
A student enrolled at Northlands said the injunction is “a relief.” 
“We were all kind of scrambling to figure out a plan in less than two weeks of finding a job and trying not to be homeless,” she said in an interview. VTDigger is not naming the student because of potential retaliation by the federal government. 
She said that Northlands is the first place “I’ve ever had three meals a day, and a lot of emotional support, and it’s the first place that I think a lot of kids have a safe environment to explore themselves as a person and [have] the ability to grow.”
The student, who is enrolled in an associate’s degree information technology dual-program between Northlands and the Community College of Vermont, said the opportunities provided by the program were unprecedented for her. 
“I would be the first woman in my family to get a degree,” she said. “I would probably stay in Vermont. I love it… I’d get a job in programming or software development after this. And I’d probably pursue my bachelor’s degree.”
The injunction was also cause for political celebration among Vermont’s Democratic state and federal officials. 
Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark also joined 18 other attorneys general to file an amicus brief in support of the program.Noting that she was “pleased, and not surprised,” by the court’s order, Clark added that “this order will allow Northlands Jobs Corps Center in Vergennes to continue serving young Vermonters in their journey to achieve their career goals and access stable housing.”In an emailed statement, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. called the Job Corps “a critical training ground and opportunity pipeline for so many Vermonters.”
“I was pleased to see it remain open and operating for the time being,” she wrote. “But the Trump administration remains adamant in ripping away these programs that give Americans a fair shot at success – while training the exact trades workers that Vermont so desperately needs. I’ll keep fighting every step of the way to keep these funds going to the programs just as Congress mandated.”U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. signed a letter with thirty eight other Senators urging the Department of Labor “to immediately reverse this decision to prevent a lapse in education and services for Job Corps students.”The injunction comes at a time where the Trump administration is butting heads with the judicial branch, as many of President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive actions have been repelled by various federal judges through nationwide injunctions.On June 27, Carter ordered parties involved in the Job Corps battle to file motions arguing whether or not the recent Supreme Court decision — which limited federal judges’ power to issue nationwide injunctions — would impact the injunction he filed by June 30. The Department of Labor requested an extension that may push the filing date to July 11.Carter also denied any order to stay the case, meaning the battle for the future of the Job Corps seems poised to continue.

Jeff Landry signs legislation on June 30, 2025. (Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry taunted a member of his own party during a press conference Monday, accusing the Republican senator of killing a bill that Landry claims would have helped lower insurance rates. 
Landry invited members of the press to a ceremony Monday in which he signed into law a group of bills, including eight different measures aimed at lowering the cost of auto and homeowner insurance costs. The governor took turns listing and explaining each of the new laws while thanking the legislators who authored them, most of whom stood behind Landry as he spoke.  
Absent from that list was House Bill 677, a measure that would have regulated attorney advertising, prohibiting lawyers from making or including any kind of misleading or deceptive claims in advertisements about the amount of money a client received from a lawsuit. 
 Insurance companies have faulted personal-injury attorneys for Louisiana’s auto insurance crisis. Landry supported the bill as an effort to tamp down what some see as a litigious environment perpetuated by a group of trial lawyers well-known for their constant barrage of commercials and billboards. 
There are several questions about whether such restrictions on attorney advertising would be constitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled lawyers had a right to advertise based on First Amendment grounds in a 1977 Arizona case which opened the floodgates for so-called “billboard lawyers” media buys. 
Nevertheless, the governor claimed the attorney advertising bill would have passed but for a single lawmaker — Republican Sen. Alan Seabaugh of Shreveport. 
“We tried to rein in lawyer advertising,” Landry said to the room of journalists and spectators. “Sen. Seabaugh seemed to not be able to come to work that day, and that bill died. I want you to know we tried. Last time we tried that bill, the [former] governor vetoed it. This time a senator couldn’t show up for work. Maybe we’ll get it done next year.”
The governor was referring to Seabaugh’s two-week absence, from May 19-29, during which the bill came up for a committee vote. Seabaugh, a lawyer, said he was stuck in a jury trial defending a nursing home being accused of wrongful death in Bossier Parish — a case he ended up winning. 

The advertising bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Kim Carver, R-Mandeville, had cleared the House in mid-May on a 75-25 vote and advanced to the Senate Judiciary A Committee, of which Seabaugh is a member. 
Carver, who did not return a request for comment Monday, brought his bill to the committee on May 28 where it failed to advance in a 3-1 party-line vote with Democrats holding an advantage due in part — but not entirely — to Seabaugh’s absence. 
“I don’t know where he’s coming from throwing shade on me for missing a vote that wouldn’t have mattered,” Seabaugh said in a phone interview Monday. “It was a 3 to 1 vote, so me not being there never affected the outcome.”  
The other Republican who missed the vote was Sen. Rick Edmonds of Baton Rouge. Edmonds, who is pastor, said he was present every day during the session but was presenting a separate bill in a House committee at the same time as the Judiciary A members were voting on Carver’s proposal.
Seabaugh said the governor is blaming him out of spite for having voted against a different bill that Landry helped write and shepherd through the Legislature — House Bill 148, a controversial measure that Landry signed into law following an ongoing public feud with another Republican elected official, Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple. 
 “He’s mad at me for voting against House Bill 148,” Seabaugh said, noting that his vote on the proposal, like with the Carver bill, made no difference to its outcome.
Seabaugh cited the same grudge as the reason why Landry vetoed one of his insurance bills on the last day of the regular session. In an interview that day, the senator said he felt blindsided by the veto because he thought he had the governor’s support. He contrasted Landry with former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat.  
“John Bel would call and tell me when he vetoed a bill,” Seabaugh said at the time. “Jeff didn’t.”
After fielding only a few questions from the press at Monday’s bill signing, the governor did not respond to a request for further comment later on Monday.

The statewide public media network would lose $2.5 million in programming and operational funds if President Donald Trump’s desired cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting come to fruition, interim executive director Sajni Kumpuris told the commission earlier this month. She said Monday that the $2.5 million CPB grant Arkansas PBS receives accounts for 51% of the network’s operating expense funding.

Fiscal year 2026 begins Tuesday, and PBS affiliate stations renew their memberships and pay their dues at the turn of the fiscal year.
About half of the at-risk $2.5 million community service grant goes toward purchasing PBS programs to air, 30% of which is chosen by PBS’ national headquarters, Kumpuris said last month. Public television stations without PBS memberships cannot access this national programming.
Arkansas PBS usually collects more than $3 million per year in individual donations, and 80% of those who donate online cite programming as their reason for giving, said Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network.
Individual donations would likely “nosedive” if the network no longer aired national PBS programming, Betley said. Some of the revenue from donations goes to the network’s operational expenses while some goes to foundation staff salaries, among other things, she said.
The foundation’s executive committee agreed last week to cover up to $1.8 million in lost federal funding if Congress approves the Trump administration’s proposed Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Betley said.
“That amount is a combination of drawing from reserves that the foundation has built over many years as well as a portion of emergency reserves that we have set aside,” she said. “But there is also a portion of it that would come from a public campaign that would basically say, ‘This is specifically to address cuts at the federal level.’”
Arkansas PBS has already agreed to make cuts to cover the remainder of the potential federal funding loss, Betley said.
Besides purchasing programming, the network’s at-risk federal grant covers operational expenses, such as running the public media network’s Conway studio and its statewide emergency weather alert system, Kumpuris said last month.

Maria Sullivan and Chairman West Doss were the only commissioners to vote against renewing the contract, saying they were unwilling to commit to it without reading the terms first.
“We would be fiscally irresponsible to commit to something this afternoon, which is what PBS says we have to do, when we don’t know where they stand, where their funding is or if they’re going to exist,” Doss said.
Attorney William Puddephatt, the commission’s counsel, said PBS’ national headquarters has not answered his or the commission’s questions about the contract in sufficient detail.
Former commission chairwoman Annette Herrington said the renewed contract should not be substantially different than in previous fiscal years. She made the motion to renew the contract “to continue to serve all Arkansans with the programming that we have provided in the past.”
Programs the network would have lost if it had disaffiliated from the national network included Antiques Roadshow and PBS Kids 24/7, Kumpuris said. Arkansas PBS would also have reverted to its previous name, the Arkansas Educational Television Network.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)When dawn broke Monday on the Pennsylvania Capitol it was a foregone conclusion that lawmakers would miss the midnight deadline to approve the next state budget.
This marks the fourth year in a row the budget will be late, failing to meet the June 30 deadline. Gov. Josh Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly offered scant insight into what’s causing the impasse and how long it might last.
For most Pennsylvanians, the lack of a budget will have few immediate noticeable effects. But if the gridlock persists into late July, it could result in financial stress for local governments, school districts, and nonprofits that receive taxpayer dollars from the spending plan.
Shapiro told reporters at a public appearance Monday that his staff and majority leaders from the Senate Republican and House Democratic caucuses had a busy weekend of meetings.
“We were all personally engaged. I think we made real progress, and we’re going to continue to make progress,” Shapiro said. “We understand what the issues are, and we are working through the solutions on those issues. I think the temperature is way down.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Republicans, who control the Senate, said that while they’ve acted on several “key components of the budget, to fund certain government functions,” they are focused on the state’s negative cashflow, as Shapiro’s plan would again dip into the state’s $11 billion surplus.
“Pennsylvania is facing a multi-billion-dollar structural deficit that we must address this year to prevent a financial crisis and tax increases in the future. Better aligning revenues with expenditures remains our top priority,” a statement from Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and Appropriations Committee Chair Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) said.
Since February, when Shapiro delivered his proposed $51.5 billion spending plan for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, Democratic lawmakers in the House have been working to pass legislation to enact Shapiro’s policy goals.
They included increases in funding for basic education, special education and school repairs, and another $526 million installment in adequacy payments to the state’s poorest school districts. The House passed legislation to reign in costs for online charter schools, setting school districts’ tuition payments at $8,000 per pupil across the state to free up $378 million a year.
The chamber has also passed legislation to provide a larger share of state sales tax revenue for public transit agencies across the state, including the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which last week passed a budget that would cut its services by nearly half.
Shapiro also proposed $750 million in additional money for highways over the next five years by shifting fuel taxes and license fees away from the state police, since Republican lawmakers have insisted on transportation improvements for rural communities and industry.
The GOP-led Senate, meanwhile, has been circumspect about options to increase tax revenue, voting down a House bill to legalize and tax marijuana for recreational use and is deeply divided on a plan to tax slot machine-like skill games that have proliferated in corner stores and social halls across the state.
Shapiro has proposed a 52% tax on skill games, which is in the neighborhood of the state’s 54% tax on casino gaming. Pace-O-Matic, the predominant producer of the machines, has lobbied for a 16% tax, while Senate Republican leaders have offered a compromise of 35%. The division has given rise to a bitter fight between Senate leaders and powerhouse lobbying firms they accuse of running an attack campaign against GOP lawmakers, Spotlight PA reported.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said Wednesday that transit funding remains a priority.
“The bottom line is that mass transit is good for Pennsylvania’s economy, not just for any region in particular, but for the whole economy,” Harris told reporters. “It helps us fund a lot of the other things that are part of this budget. How do people get to work? How do they get to school? How do they get to their doctor’s appointment? Many of them are getting there via mass transit, and that’s in rural, suburban and urban areas across this commonwealth.”
Business leaders have noted counties across the commonwealth also benefit directly from SEPTA’s employment, procurement, and commerce. 
“Over the past five years, SEPTA has awarded over $1.14 billion in contracts to Pennsylvania-based companies in 39 counties, with an average annual investment of $228 million. That’s not just rail cars and bus routes in the southeast — that’s steel, rubber, electronics, parts, safety equipment, and professional services supporting jobs across the Commonwealth,” Laura Manion, president and CEO of the Chester County Chamber of Business and Industry, and Mike Grigalonis, president & COO of the Chester County Economic Development Council, wrote in support of the transit funding increase.
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told reporters Monday afternoon that his caucus has also been active in negotiating and focused on reducing the overall spending amount while fixing the structural deficit in which the state continues to spend more than it takes in.
“We believe that the No. 1 way to get ourselves out of what we’re facing in the next couple of years is through economic growth,” Topper said, adding that energy production and education to prepare young people for the workforce are priorities.
“We have a demographics issue in (Pennsylvania). We know that, and we have to make sure that our public policy during this time, as we talk about the budget, reflects the need for change in that area,” he said.
The Senate recessed Monday evening with no immediate plan to reconvene, while the House is scheduled to return to session Tuesday morning.
Harris said the stalemate over new revenue sources doesn’t necessarily prevent the General Assembly from passing a budget.
“We have the finances to produce this year’s budget if necessary, but we put all of our cards on the table, and we’re … still waiting for the negotiations to continue,” he said. “I think today, being the 30th, may help us move forward, hopefully getting this thing done.”

(Screenshot of video from Spokane Valley Fire Department)Law enforcement on Monday identified the man who they believe killed two firefighters attempting to battle a brush fire in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene.
 

Wess Roley, 20, was identified by local coroner officials, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Monday afternoon news conference.
The suspect was found dead with a firearm nearby on Canfield Mountain, officials said Sunday. He appeared to have killed himself, Norris said Monday.
Officials believe he started a brush fire near a popular recreation area, and then fatally shot two firefighters and injured another.
Law enforcement have not released the names of the killed and injured firefighters, or a motive for the shooting.
The fire’s cause remains under investigation. But officials believe Roley started the fire with a flint starter, Norris said.
A shotgun was used, but the crime scene is still being processed, the sheriff said.
The seriously injured firefighter was released from surgery later Sunday. He was stable, Norris said Sunday. No more specific information about his condition has been released.
The firefighters Roley allegedly shot were the ones who spoke with him when they arrived on scene, Norris said.
  Officials found no criminal record for suspect. Investigation ongoing. 

Officials believe Roley had lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, Norris said. Officials could not find a criminal record for Roley, but Norris said local law enforcement had five minor interactions with him — including for trespassing and welfare checks.
“We know that he was a transient here,” Norris said. “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024. But as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place — I don’t know. He has relatives in the Priest River area. But I don’t know why he chose that. We don’t find any nexus to anything else. Maybe we’ll find more once we do an inventory of the vehicle.”
Norris said Roley appeared to be living in his vehicle and wanted to be a firefighter at some point. But he stressed information is preliminary and subject to change.
Roley grew up in an arborist family that climbed trees, and law enforcement received reports he was shooting at first responders from a tree, Norris said.
The crime scene remains active. Law enforcement have not yet inventoried Roley’s vehicle, which deputies pushed down a mountain embankment to make it harder for him to flee, Norris said.
  Fire grows to 26 acres — but structures aren’t threatened 

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 26 acres by Monday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts.
Crews on Monday are trying to reduce the fire’s growth by building a fireline. Structures aren’t threatened, and the fire hasn’t prompted evacuations, Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Fighting the fire is slow because the terrain makes it difficult to use ground assets, Norris said.
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Monday morning.
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”
  Idaho governor orders flags at half-staff 

Earlier Monday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.
The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled.
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
In a statement, Idaho Fire Chiefs Association President Kirk Carpenter said Idaho’s first responder families are devastated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our fire families in North Idaho. There are no words—please know that we are here for you, now and always,” he said.
The victims’ names will be released by local officials in due time, the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
  In D.C., Idaho’s U.S. senators ask for prayers 

Early Monday, as the U.S. Senate worked to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack.
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
 

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

“I refuse to stay silent as we watch far-right politicians attempt the largest cut to health care in American history, all so the richest 1% of Americans can receive $138 billion in tax cuts,“ Sen. Maria Collett (D-Montgomery), said at a press conference Monday. “My constituents have been calling me nonstop asking me and my colleagues to stand up to the chaos they see in Washington, to stand up to their healthcare access and their ability to afford day-to-day expenses,”
The budget bill would make substantial cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, while increasing funding for the military, border security and immigration enforcement, as well as  extending tax cuts that primarily benefit wealthy Americans. The bill will also eliminate subsidies for clean energy projects, including a number planned or underway in Pennsylvania.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget office has estimated the bill will add more than $3 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade, and could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing health insurance.
The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services has said it could result in more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and an additional 270,000 could lose access to Affordable Care Act marketplace plans through Pennie with the elimination of enhanced premium tax credits that make monthly insurance bills more affordable.
“The cuts that are coming out of Washington that are proposed are unconscionable,” Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), the chair of the state Democratic Party said. “Medicaid is the health insurance for so many of the most vulnerable folks in our community.”
Republicans, however, have deemed the cuts as necessary. 
Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick has said that the bill doesn’t cut Medicaid, but slows spending growth, which he says has ballooned too quickly. The cuts, he said, would ensure that the program can continue to protect services for more vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, the disabled and the mentally ill.
“Medicaid has been spiraling out of control,” he said at a town hall earlier this month. “We want to ensure that Medicaid is designed to protect the vulnerable people for whom it was designed, and so the legislation that’s in the Senate would slow the growth of Medicaid. It wouldn’t cut Medicaid.”
The bill is being passed through what’s called the reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass the filibuster and pass the bill with a simple majority vote. 
Since passing the House last month, it’s undergone substantial changes as Trump and Republican leaders attempt to appease dueling factions of a divided party that can only afford to lose a small handful of votes.  
Primarily, the party is split between members concerned about the bill’s overall price tag and others worried about the impacts of cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
As of Monday, the Senate has been considering dozens of amendments to the bill. If passed, it will return to the House for further amendment or a final vote.
“It is ugly, it is hurtful, it is painful,” said Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia), the minority chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “We as Senate Democrats are sending a message to people right now that it is not too late. You can still make a phone call. You can still reach out to your senator.”

(Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo)MINNEAPOLIS —Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman’s life embodied the American dream. She was raised in a family that owned a junkyard, became a lawyer but declined a life of comfortable wealth for public service, emerging as among the most influential legislators in Minnesota history.
Now she’s an emblem of the American nightmare, another victim — along with husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever Gilbert — of the political violence that’s consumed America in the past decade, adding Brooklyn Park to Buffalo, El Paso and other grim signposts of a damaged democracy.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral Mass at The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis Saturday as kind, generous and driven by a common set of values to make the world just a little bit better.
The funeral was mostly light on politics, despite the hundreds of politicos in attendance. Father Daniel Griffith in his homily, however, highlighted the injustices that Melissa Hortman tried to ameliorate.
“In Minnesota we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice — the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed our democracy.”
Gov. Tim Walz, who was both friend and governing partner to Hortman, was visibly shaken while serving as a pallbearer alongside the Hortman children. The packed Basilica was filled with Hortman’s family, friends and vast political network that Melissa Hortman built over decades by way of her effectiveness at the Legislature and down-to-earth charm. Former President Joe Biden — who hosted the Hortmans at the White House — Vice President Kamala Harris, former Gov. Mark Dayton, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and state commissioners also memorialized the lives of Hortmans.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
The Hortmans were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a politically motivated assassination. Their deaths have roiled Minnesota politics.
Hortman was a Catholic Sunday school teacher whose politics were shaped by Catholic social teaching. She was a devotee of the Golden Rule, from Matthew, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” So she would have endorsed the choice of Gospel reading Saturday, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, which is a fundamental text of Christianity.
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” Griffith said. “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.”
In his sermon, Griffith highlighted Melissa and Mark Hortman’s service and community, which he called, “the antidote to our present afflictions” and a stark contrast to the “idol of autonomy” that has ravaged America’s political landscape.
Melissa and Mark Hortman met in Washington D.C. when they were both mentoring a student. Colin and Sophie Hortman, their adult children, released a statement in the days after their killings, calling for people to honor their parents’ legacy by standing up “for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.”
Walz during his five-minute eulogy encouraged Minnesotans to find common humanity and “build a state equal to (the Hortmans’) aspirations and a politics worthy of their example.”
“Melissa was an extraordinary legislator, and Mark was her proudest supporter,” Walz said. “It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all of its significance, politics is just people. That’s all. It is just a bunch of human beings trying to do their best. Melissa understood that better than anybody.”
Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of Melissa and Mark, eulogized them at the request of the children. She remembered the Hortmans as anything but a stereotypical political family, just as focused on their children and dog and card nights and monthly dinners for law school friends as on the latest political flareup.
Williams also captured the dynamic between Melissa and her supportive husband.
“I always saw her as a balloon bouncing around, but still tethered to the earth by Mark,” Williams said.
Williams remembered the many dinners she shared with the Hortmans, including their last together on June 6 at an Italian restaurant in Robbinsdale. Walz had just called for a one-day special session, and Melissa was often getting up from the table to take calls from the governor or her DFL caucus members. No one at the table, including Mark Hortman, minded the disruption.
Even though many are grieved by the Hortmans’ deaths, Williams said that the couple would have wanted people to remember them with joy, citing Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet”:
“Some of you say joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”
Williams then said, “We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again. Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way. Goodbye, my friends.”
Colin Hortman ended the service with a prayer of St. Francis, which Melissa Hortman carried in her wallet.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
The procession departed in silence, except for the massive bell of The Basilica of St. Mary tolling, tolling.
The caskets were loaded into two hearses.
Walz handed Sophie and Colin Hortman American flags in the traditional 13-fold, for the Hortmans.
When the Hortmans were lying in state at the Capitol Friday, Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, wondered aloud what Melissa Hortman — who was famously blunt and unimpressed with grandeur — would have thought about all the pageantry.
“I think she would have said, ‘It’s a bit much.’”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)  Basin Electric Power Cooperative officials testified Monday that data centers are not behind the need for a natural gas-fired power plant in northwest North Dakota but it is getting requests from potential large-load customers. 
Basin officials made comments Monday at a Public Service Commission hearing in Williston on its proposed Bison Generation Station near Epping in eastern Williams County. 
The project would generate electricity from natural gas that is abundant in North Dakota’s oil-producing region. It also would generate power by using steam produced by the plant to turn turbines.  
The nearly $4 billion Bison Generation Station would be the first combined-cycle power plant in North Dakota. 
Basin Electric describes the project as one of the largest power generation projects in the cooperative’s history.
Benjamin Hertz, manager of power supply planning for Basin Electric, said the company is  forecasting higher levels of power use from traditional customers. 
“Much of this is due to oil and gas related activity in this region,” Hertz testified Monday. 
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Basin Electric, which provides power to smaller electric co-ops, last week announced it is developing a program to deal with large-load customers such as data centers. 
Hertz said Basin Electric has been approached with a great number of large load requests throughout its service territory that could require more power generation. 
“Basin Electric has resolved to plan for new large loads and data centers separately from its traditional load growth,” Hertz said. “This program has been designed to protect Basin Electric’s  existing member rate-payers.” 
The Bison Generation Station would have two roughly 745-megawatt units to produce about 1,490 megawatts of power. 
Jody DeLong testified as chair of the board for North Dakota Native Vote and as a concerned citizen. 
He questioned the need for such a large power plant, especially if it is not needed for data centers. 
He called the project a “$4 billion gamble” with no explanation for how it will benefit rate-payers while adding to greenhouse gas emissions. 
“There’s no clear, detailed load data for local communities, including the Mountrail-Williams Electric Cooperative, or other cooperatives in North Dakota, which would demonstrate an urgent or unmet energy need among residents,” DeLong said. 
The three-person Public Service Commission regulates for-profit electric utilities but not for member-owned cooperatives. 
Construction on the project could begin this year with the power plant being fully in service in 2030.
At peak construction in 2027, the project would employ about 1,000 people. It would employ about 50 people when complete. 
The PSC took no action after Monday’s hearing. Basin Electric will provide commissioners with more information in the coming weeks. 
In addition to PSC approval, the project will need a permit from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality.

Mike Kehoe released his budget plan during the State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe made his first round of budget vetoes hurt Missouri lawmakers where it matters most, in the earmarked state funds they added to spending plans this year.
Kehoe on Monday signed the package of 13 spending bills passed by lawmakers this year, but not before vetoing $300 million in general revenue items and putting a hold on spending for $211 million more.
The list of cuts eliminated 109 of the 248 earmarked items tracked by The Independent throughout the budget process. Another 23 were reduced by the Republican governor’s use of the line-item veto and 23 more are under restriction, meaning the only way the money will be spent is if Kehoe specifically orders it or lawmakers vote to override him.
The cuts were necessary, Kehoe said in a news release, because state revenues are being squeezed by extra spending for public schools he did not support, tax cuts he does support and the cost of disaster relief from a major tornado in St. Louis and storms in other parts of the state.
In all, Kehoe issued 208 line-item vetoes and put restrictions on 32 expenditure items. The budget passed by lawmakers, the release said, had 450 items and nearly $775 million spending Kehoe did not recommend.
“We want to assure Missourians that this action is not indicative of a larger economic problem, as our economy remains strong and resilient,” Kehoe said in the release. “Just as President Trump and the federal government is reigning in spending, the State of Missouri must do the same. While we do not have an economic problem in Missouri, we do have a spending problem in state government.”
The vetoes and spending restrictions come despite a historically healthy state surplus and revenues for the current fiscal year that are exceeding expectations. Through Friday, revenues for the current fiscal were $216 million more than anticipated when the budget was written and $31 million more than an updated estimate made in December.
That will change in the coming year and beyond, the release said.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” the release stated. “Contributing to this shortfall, ongoing general revenue spending authorized in the (fiscal year 2026) budget is projected to outpace ongoing revenues by nearly over $1 billion and grow larger in future years.”
In the letters accompanying his budget actions, Kehoe refers regularly to the revenue issue as his basis for vetoes and restrictions.
“A course correction in state finances is not only warranted but will be constitutionally required to achieve a balanced budget in future years and safeguard Missouri’s financial security and AAA bond rating going forward,” Kehoe wrote.
When Kehoe released his budget proposal in January, it anticipated the state would end the current fiscal year with an unobligated general revenue balance of $2.6 billion. At that time, the unobligated surplus at the end of the coming fiscal year was projected at $1.4 billion, but during the recent special session state Budget Director Dan Haug told lawmakers he expects no more than half that amount — $600 million to $700 million — will remain on June 30, 2026.
  Missouri Senate Appropriations Chairman Lincoln Hough, right, discusses a budget item May 8 with House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton during negotiations over the fiscal 2026 budget (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Kehoe is wrong to use uncertainty about future revenues and the size of the remaining surplus to justify his cuts, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said in an interview with The Independent.
He told the governor that in a conversation last week, Hough said.
“He said revenues aren’t really coming in where we thought they were,” Hough said. “And I said, ‘Well, governor, I hate to disagree with you on this, but it’s actually about a percent over what we agreed on for the (consensus revenue estimate) as far as I know right now.”
Lawmakers approved $53.4 billion in spending for the coming year, including $16 billion in general revenue. Kehoe’s actions reduced the total budget to $50.8 billion and $15.5 billion in general revenue. A large portion of the overall reduction is from Kehoe vetoing changes in how federal highway funds are managed.
Major new spending items in the budget include:

A $300 million increase for the foundation formula, the state’s basic aid program for public schools.
$107 million to revamp the child care payment system so providers receive their money at the beginning of each month for the children enrolled in their center.
$50 million to expand the number of children served by the MOScholars voucher program, which helps parents pay tuition at private and parochial schools.
A state employee pay raise plan based on longevity, with raises up to 10%, plus pay increases for Department of Corrections officers who work in high-security and administrative segregation areas.
Almost $93 million to pay off a judgment against the state for damages claimed by a vendor who worked on the state’s computerized Medicaid enrollment system. A $23 million judgment grew to more than $50 million as the state appealed and interest accrued. The appropriation includes both state and federal funds to allow flexibility in the way the judgment is paid.

The surplus revenue being used by lawmakers and Kehoe in the budget approved Monday represents money accumulated when tax collections increased at double-digit rates for two years and the state substituted federal COVID relief funds for general revenue spending.
The state collected $13.4 billion in general revenue last year and the consensus revenue estimate released in December projected receipts would decline by about 0.6% in the current fiscal year. Revenues through Friday were up by about 0.4%.
The projected increase in revenue for the coming year has evaporated because of a tax cut bill enacted by lawmakers that is awaiting Kehoe’s signature and possible revenue reductions due to federal tax changes.
The new tax break would allow investors to reap the profits from long-term capital gains — the increase in value of an asset held for 12 months or longer — without paying state income tax. The bill also would expand the “Circuit Breaker” tax credit intended to offset property taxes for lower-income seniors and people with disabilities.
The tax changes being debated at the federal level are also likely to lower Missouri tax collections. The House-passed version of the budget reconciliation bill would reduce Missouri tax receipts by at least $170 million in the coming year, experts have said, while changes to benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps could shift hundreds of millions of costs from federal to state taxpayers.
The vetoes and restrictions can be reversed by legislative override votes, which would take place in September. The vetoes and restrictions include, for example, almost every general revenue-funded road project added by lawmakers, including projects in Hough’s district, the district of Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, and House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
One item important to Deaton, $19 million to buy land in McDonald County for a state park in his district, drew a second veto, but most of the money made it through. Kehoe cut $7.5 million from the appropriation, while Gov. Mike Parson, who left office in January, vetoed a similar appropriation in its entirety a year ago.
Whether any of the vetoes or restrictions will be overridden will depend on how mad people are about them, Hough said.
“It just depends on what the specific line would be that would rise to the level of irritating people enough to the point where they say, ‘We want to go override the governor in his first year,’” Hough said.
This article was updated at 6:20 p.m. to correct the amount vetoed from the McDonald County park funding.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)New Iowa laws on issues from transgender civil rights protections to changes to Iowa’s unemployment insurance tax system will be officially enacted Tuesday.
July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, is when most laws passed during a legislative session begin enforcement. However, there are some measures that have other start dates – for example, warnings will begin Tuesday for violations of Senate File 22, the law banning the use of cellphones while driving outside of hands-free or voice activated modes, but criminal charges will not start until January 2026.
Additionally, there are also several education-related laws that take effect July 1, but will not be enacted until the 2025-2026 school year begins.
Here’s what to know about some of the changes in Iowa Code taking effect:
Gender identity in the Iowa Civil Rights Act: The first bill Reynolds signed in the 2025 legislative session was  Senate File 418, removing gender identity as a protected class in the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As the measure takes effect, there will no longer be legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and education for transgender individuals or others who have been denied access to these services or opportunities because of their gender identity.
This new law directly relates to another measure going into effect Tuesday through the state’s Health and Human Services appropriations bill, House File 1049. The law bans Medicaid coverage for transgender Iowans seeking gender-affirming health care, like sex reassignment surgery, hormone treatment therapy and other physical health care treatments for gender dysphoria. Previous attempts to enact a ban on Medicaid coverage for gender-related health care were struck down in court because of the protections provided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act.

Unemployment insurance taxes: Iowa will collect less in unemployment insurance taxes from employers with the enactment of Senate File 607. The law cuts the taxable wage base used in collecting unemployment insurance taxes from employers in half, from 66.7% to 33.4%, in addition to making changes to employer contribution rates. When signing the bill into law in early June, Reynolds said the change was “long overdue” in correcting overpayments into the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund .
Anti-SLAPP lawsuits: “Strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits, can see expedited relief in courts under House File 472. SLAPP lawsuits are cases brought by an entity against news organizations or activists to suppress public speech or reporting on an issue by engaging in an expensive, drawn-out legal battle. The new law will allow these lawsuits – court actions related to First Amendment rights, like the freedom of speech and press – to be addressed more quickly. The law passed includes a caveat that anti-SLAPP protections cannot be applied retroactively, meaning that only lawsuits filed July 1 onward are eligible for expedited relief.
Citizenship verification for voters: House File 954 allows registered voters to have their citizenship status challenged at the polls. However, supporters of the measure and Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, who proposed the law, say it also contains provision that will prevent the need for widespread voter eligibility challenges similar to what happened in the 2024 election, by allowing the Secretary of State’s office to verify citizenship status of registered voters before an election through contracts with state and federal agencies, as well as private entities.
The measure also includes a ban on ranked choice voting, though this component of the bill does not go into effect until Jan. 1, 2026.
Election recounts: The process for conducting – and calling –  election recounts in Iowa will be different under House File 928. Initial election results must be within a threshold of 1% or 50 votes, whichever is less, and within a 0.15% difference for recounts in statewide and federal races, for a candidate to request a recount under the new law. Previously, candidates could request a recount with no limitations on the margin of victory in initial results, though the state would only cover the costs of a recount if results were within one percentage point.
The law also changes the composition of election recount boards to be led by the county auditor, with staff and hired election workers making up the boards. An equal number of workers from each political party is required.
Pharmacy benefit managers: The law setting regulations on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs),  Senate File 383, is a measure some pharmacists and supporters say will help keep rural and independent pharmacies across the state in business. The law stops PBMs, the entities that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies, from engaging in certain business practices that push consumers to use mail-order or specific pharmacies, like the use of financial incentives or penalties. It also sets a dispensing fee of $10.68 from PBMs to pharmacists for each prescription filled at rural and small pharmacies.
Though the law will be enacted Tuesday, a lawsuit from several businesses and organizations filed in late June is seeking to overturn the measure.
Firearm age limits: The minimum age to own and carry handguns, like pistols and revolvers, is lowered from age 21 to age 18 by House File 924. While buying a handgun from a federally licensed firearm dealer would still be banned for 18- to 20-year-olds under federal restrictions, the measure makes a change that lawmakers said addresses recent federal court decisions that found similar laws restricting firearms for adults under age 21 were unconstitutional.
Here are 11 new Iowa laws that include criminal penalties

Cellphones in school: With rules set to take effect as K-12 schools return for the 2025-2026 school year, House File 782 requires public K-12 school districts set policies that, at minimum, restrict the use of cellphones during instructional periods. The measure, one of Reynolds’ priorities for the 2025 legislative session, includes exceptions, such as students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that involves the use of a cellphone or other device in their accommodations, and when a school district approves a parent’s request for their child to retain access to their phone because of a “legitimate” reason related to their mental or physical health.
Fetal development instruction: Senate File 175 requires Iowa schools’ human growth and development classes for students in grades 5-12 include fetal development videos and graphics that depict “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.” The content shown in schools to meet this requirement cannot come from entities that perform or “promote” abortions, or that contract, affiliate, or make referrals to organizations which perform or promote abortions.
Threat assessment teams: Senate File 583 allows K-12 public school districts, private schools and charters schools to establish threat assessment teams to prevent school shootings and violence. These teams, which can be made up of school officials, law enforcement, mental health and social services workers, are able to share “reasonably necessary” information about students if their behavior is deemed a potential safety risk to other students or school staff.

Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck, speaks on the House floor on May 1, 2025. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Ethics Commission found Rep. Jason Dockter committed three ethics violations related to his ownership of a Bismarck building, but the agency did not hand down any penalties for the lawmaker.
The announcement, released Friday evening, marks the first time the commission has declared that a public official engaged in unethical behavior.
The Ethics Commission noted the Bismarck Republican likely leveraged his position and his relationships with state employees to arrange a lease with the Attorney General’s Office, according to the commission’s 93-page investigation report.
The report also identified unanswered questions regarding the finances of the building and highlighted challenges that stalled the investigation, including witnesses who declined to be interviewed.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Dockter chose not to appeal the decision, according to the commission. The commission concluded that in this circumstance, it’s up to the Legislature to decide whether disciplinary action is necessary.
Dockter is the partial owner of a company that leases a building located at 1720 Burlington Drive in south Bismarck to the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office and Department of Health and Human Services. At one point, North Dakota Information Technology was also a tenant, according to the report.
In 2023, Dockter voted in favor of two budget bills that set aside money for the Attorney General’s Office and Department of Health and Human Services leases. State law and ethics rules forbid lawmakers from voting on legislation that could give them a unique financial benefit.
Eight different people submitted complaints about Dockter raising concerns about the building deal in September and October 2022, according to the report.
More than two-and-a-half years since the complaints were first filed, the Ethics Commission has concluded that these votes represented two violations of its conflict of interest rules.
Additionally, a 12-person Burleigh County jury last year found Dockter guilty of a criminal misdemeanor for casting the votes. The Ethics Commission considers this conviction a third ethical violation. A district court judge ordered him to complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $2,500 fine, in addition to 360 days of unsupervised probation. Dockter has completed those requirements, court records indicate.
Dockter did not respond to a request for comment sent to the attorney representing the company that owns the building, Monte Rogneby.
The commission recounted the lengthy saga of the building deal in its report, which drew from sources including witness interviews, court records and state investigations.
The report notes that Dockter’s violations “likely could have been avoided with education on how to disclose and manage conflicts of interest.”
“It is clear from the commission’s investigation there is a general lack of clarity on what a potential conflict of interest is and how to disclose and manage them when they come up,” the report states.
Jury finds Rep. Dockter guilty of misdemeanor conflict-of-interest charge

The commission’s report includes excerpts from a November 2024 interview of Dockter conducted by Ethics Commission staff. In the interview, Dockter stated that he did not believe at the time he cast the votes that that was breaking any ethics laws or rules. 
His reasoning included, among other things, that the bills did not single him out specifically, that the leases were only one small part of the budgets and that his votes wouldn’t have changed the outcome of the legislation.
The commission also discovered that Dockter partially owns three other Bismarck properties that are leased or were previously leased to state entities:

601 Channel Drive, which was previously leased to the Highway Patrol and is now rented to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
1700 Schafer St., which is leased to Bismarck State College
1838 E Interstate Ave., which is leased to the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy

The commission says that its conflict of interest rules don’t set specific penalties for violators, so the agency did not penalize Dockter for the violations.  
According to the commission, the Legislative Assembly can make a determination of whether Dockter violated House rules requiring lawmakers to declare conflicts on bills they have special interests with. It also has the discretion to pursue disciplinary action against Dockter.
Dockter during the 2025 legislative session declared conflicts of interest on bills multiple times, the report states.
The Ethics Commission said that it ran into several roadblocks that stalled the completion of its investigation into Dockter. It had to the investigation on hold while the criminal case against him proceeded, for one.
The commission also struggled to get agencies including the Attorney General’s Office and Legislative Council to turn over records. 
Legislative leaders to discuss ethics rules after guilty verdict

According to the commission, the Attorney General’s Office declined to provide some email records and documents from a Montana investigation commissioned by the state into the building deal. The agency did provide some other requested records, however, the report states.
The Attorney General’s Office also did not respond to the North Dakota Monitor’s request for comment Monday.
The Ethics Commission also was unable to obtain Dockter’s legislative emails. Lawmaker emails are not public records, though emails of other state officials are public. Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said he needed either a waiver from Dockter or a subpoena to provide the emails, according to the Ethics Commission’s report. The commission declined to pursue the emails.
Additionally, some witnesses — including Bureau of Criminal Investigation Division Director Lonnie Grabowska and Liz Brocker, former executive assistant to Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem — refused requests for interviews from the commission. Grabowska instead asked for questions to be sent over email which he said would “allow for the exchange of question and answer in an effective manner,” according to the report.
The Ethics Commission noted it does not have a clear way to obtain a subpoena to compel people to sit for interviews or force agencies to produce records.
The report also called on the Legislature, the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee and the Office of the State Auditor to look into lingering questions regarding the lease deal.
Sources cited in the report dispute whether all of the money that went into the property was authorized by the Legislature. For one, the money the Attorney General’s Office spent on the building ultimately went more than $1.5 million over its initial estimate.
The report notes that the property and the Attorney General’s Office have been unable to mutually settle the financials of the building renovation.
The Ethics Commission also suggests the Office of State Auditor should consider conducting a more comprehensive performance audit of the Attorney General’s Office regarding the building project. 
It’s unclear what steps the Legislature might take with respect to the commission’s recommendations. House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, did not respond to a request for comment Monday. 
The Ethics Commission was established in 2018 by a voter-initiated amendment to the state constitution. It’s tasked with promoting ethical behavior in the areas of elections, transparency, corruption and lobbying.

Nicholas Scutari talks with Sen. Bob Smith in the Statehouse in Trenton on Monday, June 30, 2025. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers approved a $58.8 billion spending bill in votes that largely fell along party lines just hours before a deadline that would have sent the state government into a shutdown.
The budget, which Gov. Phil Murphy must sign before midnight, maintains a full pension payment and promises to send more than $12 billion to aid the state’s K-12 schools, but it dips into state reserves to support a structural deficit that has expanded above the levels Murphy pitched in February.
“What does this budget include? It includes record amounts of property tax relief. It includes fully funding the pension payment for the fifth year in a row, fully funding the school funding formula,” said Sen. Paul Sarlo, the chamber’s budget chairman.
The Senate approved the bill in a 26-13 vote, while the Assembly approved it in a 52-27 vote with one abstention.
The governor is expected to sign the bill later Monday. It’s unclear whether he’ll employ a line-item veto that could strike specific spending items without spiking the entire spending bill.
Democratic lawmakers praised the bill for its reversals of some cuts proposed by Murphy.
“I think the budget came out pretty well. There’s a tremendous amount of spending on really important things,” said Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union)
The plan includes a $6.7 billion surplus the state is forecasted to maintain at the end of the fiscal year that begins July 1. While reduced from the record levels seen in recent years — the state’s reserves pushed to above $10 billion in fiscal year 2024 but have since been reduced by deficit spending — the surplus is still among the largest in state history.
The budget will continue to run a structural deficit. Spending levels in the bill exceed revenue — including from one-shot sources that cannot or will not recur in the fiscal year that begins in July 2026 — by $1.5 billion, down from $2.1 billion the prior year but up from the $1.2 billion Murphy proposed in February.
Republican members criticized the spending bill’s size and breakneck passage. Those misgivings have become something of a yearly exercise for GOP lawmakers who have seen the budget swell from the $35.5 billion approved in Chris Christie’s final year as governor.
“The truth about the budget is that it continues us on an unsustainable path. The budget does not make New Jersey more affordable. We are once again spending too much,” said Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz (R-Union), the chamber’s GOP budget officer.
Much of those increases can be attributed to heightened pension payments and school aid, which have risen by nearly $8.8 billion under Murphy.
“We can all agree this budget spends more than Gov. Murphy’s budget in 2018. But why? Let’s talk about where the budget growth has been focused. The top six drivers in spending growth are the following: the pension payment, school funding, direct property tax relief, Medicaid health benefits, and programs for the developmentally disabled,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the chamber’s budget chair.

The budget includes payments under Stay NJ, a property tax relief program that promises to halve seniors’ property tax bills, to a cap of $6,500. Stay NJ will pay a half-year’s benefit in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Republicans also derided new taxes both chambers approved Monday. Those include higher fees on the sale of properties worth more than $2 million, casinos’ online wagering wins, cigarettes, and electronic cigarette fluid.
The budget has faced criticism from other corners, including from high-ranking members of the administration. Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh railed against a provision that would bar officials from blocking Medicaid payments to low-performing nursing homes.
“If the budget passes without changes, the Legislature will be on the side of bad nursing homes that harm New Jersey’s most vulnerable residents — without even giving the public a chance to weigh in,” Walsh warned on social media Sunday.
Attorney General Matt Platkin railed against provisions that would divert $45 million in opioid settlement money to the state’s general fund, arguing those dollars were meant to fund addiction treatment and not be used to support overall state spending.
Others took aim at diversions from the state’s Clean Energy Fund. NJ Transit is set to receive $140.1 million in clean energy money in the coming July-to-June fiscal year, and the budget would pull an additional $50 million of its dollars into the general fund.
The diversions have irked progressive and environmental groups that charge money from the fund should be used for renewable energy projects. They said pulling its funds into the state budget could delay generation capacity that could push down spiking electricity prices.
“The public is being told we’re making progress in making our state’s energy system more affordable and reliable, but the budget tells a very different story,” said Anjuli Ramos-Busot, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. “We urge lawmakers to reverse this raid and deliver a budget that invests in the future, not robs from it.”
Antoinette Miles, state director for the New Jersey Working Families Party, said the spending bill does too little to insulate New Jersey from expected federal cuts that could deprive it of between $2.5 and $5 billion in federal Medicaid dollars. The budget, she said, “fails to meet the moment.”
Business groups welcomed some parts of the budget — like sales tax exemptions for baby items like cribs and tax credits for manufacturers — they chiefly worried it would make New Jersey businesses less competitive.

OMAHA — Richard Randall Sr. was a fan of President Donald Trump’s crusade to beef up border security — that is, until a wrong turn onto a local military base left his “little buddy” in a big bind and Randall with a whole different perspective.

A lifelong Nebraskan, U.S. Navy vet and dad, Randall had developed a father-son-like relationship with Jazon Gonzalez Perez, a Guatemalan migrant who managed a couple of local restaurants in the Plattsmouth area where Randall lives. He described Gonzalez Perez as an inquisitive, eager-to-learn hard worker.
The mentorship had grown to the point that Gonzalez Perez called Randall on June 7 when he — while looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work — wound up in a snag with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A cell phone search had led Gonzalez Perez toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base, where he was stopped and detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.
Gonzalez Perez called Randall, who told the Nebraska Examiner he was blindsided by seeing immigration agents take away his buddy. He said conversations with on-site local law enforcement officers led him to believe Gonzalez Perez would be allowed to leave if Randall drove the car.
Randall said it looked as though the plain-clothed ICE agents were called into duty unexpectedly. One brought a child with him as if the two had been on a family outing.
“I said, ‘Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. He’s a good kid. He just made a wrong turn,’” Randall said, recounting the episode. “I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists.
“He’s none of those.”

Expected ‘God-fearing’ workers last

Gonzalez Perez now sits in ICE custody at an Iowa jail, awaiting possible deportation for being in the country without proper authorization. And Randall says he is fuming over tactics he said turned out not to be what he voted for last November.
He expected “God-fearing” workers to be last in line. For the Plattsmouth-area resident who considers himself an independent swing voter, a different reality has “hit home” and shifted his mindset on federal immigration enforcement.

“Call me naive, but my clear understanding was we were going to go after the bad actors, not hardworking immigrants,” said Randall.
His frustration intensified in the days after the Offutt turn, as ICE and Homeland Security Investigations on June 10 detained nearly 80 workers from a worksite raid at an Omaha food plant. Not since a 2018 immigration operation in and around O’Neill, which ensnared 133 workers, had Nebraska seen such a large-scale enforcement action.
ICE officials said the raid at Glenn Valley Foods was prompted by a federal criminal search warrant suspecting widespread use of stolen identifications by workers there to gain the jobs. So far, available federal court records show three of the workers that were detained have been charged criminally as a result of the operation, including one for stolen ID, though an ICE spokeswoman said Thursday the probe continues.

Raids were conducted days prior to Omaha’s in places such as a Home Depot and in a garment district in Los Angeles, sparking protests that then spilled across the country. Trump’s call for the Marines and California National Guard troops without the consent of that state’s governor escalated tensions.
Polling shows Randall is not alone in his frustration, as people witness the reality of stepped-up immigration enforcement at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration.
A CBS News survey conducted June 4-6 — prior to widespread protests of ICE arrests in Los Angeles — found 54% of people approved of Trump’s approach to deportations.
A more recent Quinnipiac University poll, released June 26, indicated 41% of voters  approved of the way Trump is handling immigration issues, compared to 46% who approved three months earlier in the university’s poll from March.
Approval from independent voters on the immigration question dropped to 32% from 41% in March.

Trump himself has delivered conflicting signals, reportedly ordering officials on June 12 to tap the brakes on raids at farms, hotels, restaurants and meatpacking plants. Days later, his social media post called for federal officials to “do all in their power” to deliver the “single largest mass deportation” program in history. His major targets: the Democratic strongholds of Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
Flip flop
The flip-flopping concerns leaders at the Omaha-based Center for Immigrant & Refugee Advancement, saying it “further erodes trust for immigrant communities.”
CIRA, which provides legal services statewide, said any claim that enforcement is focused on “dangerous” individuals does not align with what its lawyers are seeing on the ground. It said mothers and fathers, including some who had been in the U.S. for decades, are being “ripped” from their families.
“This is not a public safety initiative — it’s political theater and our communities are paying the price,” the statement said.
According to TRAC, a widely-used national clearinghouse that tracks immigration and detention trends, ICE as of mid-June reported detaining 56,397 people  — up from 38,525 a year ago and a record high since 2019 when the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse began publishing semi-monthly statistics.
TRAC said nearly 72% of the detainees had no previous criminal conviction. Of the 28% who did, TRAC said many had been convicted of offenses such as minor traffic violations.

Longtime Omaha immigration attorney Rachel Yamamoto said she has noticed a pivot by federal officials to go after “easy pickings, low-hanging fruit,” apparently to meet the reported quotas of up to 3,000 arrests daily demanded by the Trump administration.
She pointed out her own clients: a mother-daughter duo detained June 4 at an appointment that in years past was a routine “check in.”
Maria De Leon of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, had entered the U.S. in 2014, with 3-year-old daughter Hermelinda in tow. She was released at the border to await a “credible fear” interview with federal officials that came six years later.
Her plea to stay was denied, and she was under an Order of Supervision to check in annually with immigration officials, Yamamoto said. Federal officials did not violate any rules in detaining De Leon, the attorney noted, as the food plant worker had an outstanding order of removal. But she called it “a drastic change from usual procedures.”
“She’s been on this order of supervision since 2014,” Yamamoto said of De Leon. “Everything was fine every year, until now. She’s never been arrested. She’s had a work permit. Her husband is working legally.”
Yamamoto and De Leon’s husband, who was waiting in another room, were particularly taken aback that Hermelinda, 14, also was detained. Yamamoto was with the mom and daughter when agents asked the teen to empty her pockets. She pulled out her phone and a lip gloss.
“That moment was horrible,” Yamamoto said. “Her eyes got big, like, ‘Am I being detained right now?’ I’m glad they didn’t cuff them.”
In past experience, Yamamoto said, youths typically were allowed to stay with the other parent. De Leon’s husband, Abel, had arrived in the U.S. two years prior to his wife and daughter, fleeing gangs, and has had an active asylum application pending for more than a decade in a backlogged court system. The couple’s 10-year-old son, born in the U.S., remains with dad in their South Omaha home.
De Leon’s family received word a few days later that mother and daughter were together in a family ICE facility in Texas. Yamamoto said the mom likely has no chance to stay in the U.S., though Hermelinda appears eligible for an asylum interview.

Businessman’s view
 

Immigration arrests have increased nationwide and more than doubled in 38 states since Trump took office Jan. 20, the New York Times reported Friday.
Nebraska has averaged 4.3 daily arrests — a 343% rise from 2024, the newspaper reported, based on data obtained through a Freedom of Information lawsuit by the Deportation Data Project at the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.
The data covers administrative arrests (those in which ICE seeks to deport rather than criminally prosecute the arrestee) conducted by the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division through June 10. It does not include criminal arrests, arrests made by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations divisions or Customs and Border Protection.
From a small businessman’s perspective, Gary Jenkins of Omaha said he was confused and in unfamiliar territory when a Guatemalan crew member was apprehended by ICE agents who followed him and his brother on a recent Saturday work morning into a gas station.

Jenkins said he jumped into action to find legal help for the man he said reported loyally to housing renovation job sites for years. He described the man, in his early 40s, as a father of three. His understanding is that the worker had missed an immigration court date in New York while living in Omaha.
Soon after his detention, the man was returned to his homeland. His wife and kids remain in the Omaha area, as does a brother, who Jenkins says has legal status.
“These guys are over here doing great work,” he said. “Now I have to go out and find somebody I can trust and believe in.”
Federal officials paint a different picture. Mark Zito, special agent in charge of a Homeland Security Investigations office that covers Omaha, recently took aim at people supporting workers detained at Glenn Valley — pointing out havoc that can occur if an undocumented worker uses a stolen Social Security number to gain employment.
Federal officials have said that 100 “real victims” face financial and emotional consequences as a result of their identities being used fraudulently at Glenn Valley.










These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans.


– Mark Zito, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations office in Omaha


“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” Zito said in a statement. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives, isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
ICE offered a handful of examples, including: a Texan struggling to get Social Security disability payments as their ID was being fraudulently used to earn wages at Glenn Valley; a Coloradoan asked to repay $5,000 after their income was falsely increased due to wages earned at Glenn Valley, and a nursing student from Missouri losing out on college financial assistance because fraudulent use of ID pushed up income.

Gov. Pillen calls hard workers ‘A-OK’

Longtime South Omahan Sharon Boll sees the complexities, and sides with Trump policies.
She recently sat in a lawn chair watching an anti-ICE rally unfold in her neighborhood. She expressed empathy for families separated by deportations and trying to fix their residency status and respected the right to protest.
“I know the long citizenship path is a pain in the butt, but they need to be here legally,” said Boll, who had a large framed image of Jesus Christ propped on a chair next to her.  “A lot less harm will come to them.”
Even Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, — quick to say he is “a 100% supporter of ICE” — has revealed a nuanced opinion of immigration enforcement, depending on the situation.

He said he has been to the border: “I’ve seen criminals and terrorists and kids being loaded like pack mules full of fentanyl and synthetic methamphetamines coming from China. Safety is the highest calling of government, that we get the criminals and terrorists out of here. That’s the focus and what I believe in.”
Pillen told the Nebraska Examiner he was “not talking about” established immigrant families, though, and urged Congress to “fix the immigration issue.”
“Anybody that is here working hard and being a good neighbor, they’re A-OK. They’re fine,” Pillen said.
He said he did see a problem at the Glenn Valley operation because of “concentration of folks doing criminal activity of stealing people’s ID — that’s a grave offense.”

Stopped at Offutt gate

Randall said he had been supportive of Trump’s crackdown when he understood the target to be high-level criminals.
Admittedly, he said he does not know all the intricacies of immigration law and what it takes for a foreign-born worker to enter or remain in the country with U.S. permission. He said he is familiar, however, with the manager at one of his go-to diners that he came to know as a sort of “adopted son.”
Over time, he learned that Gonzalez Perez had left his homeland to try and make a better living and help his siblings. His dad is a farmer in Guatemala, and his mom is deceased.
On a recent Saturday, Gonzalez Perez set out to make a bank deposit for his employer. The regular bank site was closed at the time. His boss told him it could wait, but Gonzalez Perez said he wanted to make sure payroll could be met, said Randall.
The online search led Gonzalez Perez to a satellite branch on the Offutt base property. A statement from Offutt’s public affairs chief said the man was detained at the gate, after presenting a Guatemalan ID card rather than a valid driver’s license.

Per security protocol, 55th Wing Security Forces contacted the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office and ICE “due to the individual operating a vehicle without a valid license and presenting a foreign identification card with no documentation authorizing access to the installation,” said Kris “Krispy” Pierce, who heads public affairs for the 55th Wing and Offutt.
“The safety and security of our installation and personnel remain our highest priority,” said Pierce.
Randall, called by Gonzalez Perez, said he first spoke by phone to an onsite sheriff’s deputy and, based on conversations, believed he would be able to drive his friend off base. Upon arriving, he found Gonzalez Perez sitting in his car blocked by cones.
Immigration agents later arrived, ran information through a device and put his friend in handcuffs, respectfully and without incident, Randall said. Gonzalez Perez is in ICE custody at the Pottawattamie County Jail.

‘Tipping point’

Gonzalez Perez has an immigration court hearing scheduled in early July.
His attorney said she prefers not to comment on the case.
Randall said he is monitoring closely. He believes deportation and immigration policy could be a political “tipping point” for independent voters like himself.
“I’m all for arresting bad actors. I think we all are,” Randall said. “That’s not what happened here.”

University of Missouri Health Care has not been part of the Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield network since April 1, making services at one of central Missouri’s dominant providers more expensive for about 90,000 people.
Throughout negotiations, MU Health Care CEO Ric Ransom told the Senate Insurance and Banking Committee, the two entities couldn’t find any common ground.
The deadlock continues despite an offer presented during the hearing by an administrator with Anthem’s parent company Elevance Health.
Rich Novack, Elevance’s president of commercial markets, said the company will give annual increases at 1% over the Consumer Price Index, or 3.3% for this year. MU Health’s latest offer asked for a 9% increase.
“That’s offer No. 1, right here, right now,” Novack said. “We could end this any second.”
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, characterized the presentation “like a TV show.”
The hearing was less like an episode of Let’s Make a Deal and more closely resembled Dr. Phil, with an airing of grievances between MU Health Care, Anthem and their customers.
The committee, which normally does not hold hearings on insurance provider disputes, called the two parties together to get a status update on negotiations and try to nudge them toward agreement.
“Our purpose here is to get these two entities there to make a decision to protect the 90,000 people that are not protected right now,” the committee’s chair Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, said at the start of the hearing.
Missouri Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, called for the hearing two weeks ago, saying in a Facebook post she hopes to “get the facts.”
“I am strongly encouraging both MU and Anthem to get this figured out prior to that hearing,” she wrote.
Ransom said that MU Health Care has offered a compromise during a year of negotiations, but Anthem has not budged.
“To this date, the total economic value of every proposal that we received from Anthem over the last year has been the same. So in the most literal ways, we are at this hearing today because Anthem never negotiated,” he said.
Anthem disagrees.
“We believe that we have countered multiple times,” Novack said.
During negotiations, both MU Health Care and Elevance have reported increased revenue, but both told committee members that there are growing expenses to contend with.
Elevance, a for-profit company, reported increased revenue in the first quarter of 2025 with an operating gain of $3.2 billion. During the quarter, the company repurchased nearly $880 million in stocks as part of a long-term buyback plan.
The University of Missouri reported during its Board of Curators meeting last week that MU Health had a $53.5 million operating gain during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2025, beating projections by $19.9 million.
Greg Damron, MU Health Care’s chief financial officer, told the board that gains are “ahead of where we planned to be, but where we planned to be is not at a sufficient level for our long-term sustainability.”
The figures do not include May and June, in which Anthem and MU Health were out of contract.
Damron said May came in under projection. And there has been “lower volumes” in June, “some of that due to Anthem.”
Ransom told the committee that operating margins have been thinning since 2019.
“We’ve been able to maintain a positive operating margin throughout this year, and I expect we’ll be able to end the year in the black,” he said. “But (the disagreement) is having an impact on MU Health Care.”

The dispute is also hurting the state’s employees. The Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan uses Anthem and is one year into a five-year contract that is renewable annually.
John Wiemann, who began as executive director of the state’s care plan in May, said there isn’t enough time to make changes to the carrier.
“We have been looking at other options, but none of those options are ones that we can do and implement right away with an Oct. 1 deadline,” he said.
Some of the 90,000 MU Health Care patients with Anthem health insurance testified about the ensuing hardship. Many had concerns that they were not able to access continuity of care programs.
Novack said MU Health Care denied offers for continuity of care. Ransom said MU had issues with a “difficult and confusing” continuity of care plan dictated by Anthem.

A second strike is set to begin July 10 at Essentia Health facilities in northeast Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin. A group of unionized nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse midwives and clinical nurse specialists — referred to collectively as “advanced practice providers” — will be the first with that title in Minnesota history to participate in a so-called “unfair labor practice” or ULP strike
ULP strikes are related to an employers’ violation of labor laws — rather than better pay or hours — and provide stronger job protections than other kinds of strikes. 
Sara McCumber, who has worked for Essentia Health as a nurse practitioner for 24 years and is part of her union’s negotiating unit, said Essentia has refused to come to the table to negotiate.
Essentia Health has contested the union election via the National Labor Relations Board, but a ruling in January shot down Essentia’s most recent appeal.
Nurses with the Minnesota Nurses Association say their top priority isn’t pay — it’s staffing.

Game and Fish commissioners face influential, reluctant parties in quest to designate Wyoming’s first migration corridor since the state revamped its policy six years ago. 
The post Protecting the ‘Path of the Pronghorn’ draws support, but must again overcome industry resistance appeared first on WyoFile .","When it comes to designating Wyoming’s first migration corridor in over six years, retired sage grouse biologist Tom Christiansen puts it bluntly. 
“If not now, when?” Christiansen wrote in a comment letter to his former employer, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “If we fail to designate the Sublette Antelope Corridor, what is the point of the Executive Order?”
Precipitated by industry concerns, Gov. Mark Gordon’s 2019 executive order took the power to designate migration corridors out of Game and Fish’s hands, and instead created the more labyrinthine process playing out now.  
There are reasons for the slowed pace, agency officials have explained, but the governor’s migration policy has proven controversial and drawn questions about whether it functions to protect the threatened passageways relied upon by Wyoming wildlife. 
Christiansen’s support for the formal designation of what’s perhaps the Lower 48’s most-famous migration path is shared by the large majority of people and organizations who submitted a recent round of comments to the state. WyoFile reviewed the hundreds of comments obtained through a Wyoming Public Records Act request. The feedback came in response to Game and Fish’s recently completed 140-page “biological risk and opportunity assessment” for Sublette antelope — and it precedes a critical vote.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission had been scheduled to consider designating the Sublette Antelope Migration Corridor at their July meeting in Casper, but the agenda item was recently removed and is being bumped to the September meeting in Lander, according to Game and Fish Deputy Chief of Wildlife Martin Hicks. 
A bulk of the comments show that Wyoming residents want state decision-makers to press ahead with protecting the Sublette Antelope Migration Corridor. The area encompasses a webbed, 165-mile-long network of corridors, stopover sites and bottlenecks that trace across western Wyoming from Interstate 80 all the way north to Grand Teton National Park. 
When asked, “Do you believe that the Commission should recommend designation of this corridor to the Governor?” all but two of the hundreds of people who responded via the state’s comment submission portal answered yes. Additional letters sent in also leaned heavily in the direction of wanting the state to proceed with its slowed, but not stopped pursuit of designation.

Pinedale resident Carmel Kail illustrated the “urgency of the designation” by pointing to an oil and gas lease on state land within a bottleneck where the Sublette Pronghorn Herd crosses the New Fork River. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department recommended stipulations to protect the undesignated corridor there, but its guidance was ignored. 
“In sum, you cannot designate soon enough,” Kail wrote in her letter.
Linda Baker, who directs the Upper Green River Alliance, also jotted down an impassioned plea. 
“Our pronghorn have been celebrated in the pages of Smithsonian, National Geographic and by David Attenborough himself,” the Sublette County conservationist wrote. “Millions have been invested in easements and overpasses.”
“But promises, money and words alone will not maintain this pronghorn herd,” Baker added. “The best science in the world will not guarantee our pronghorns’ future. Only action at this critical time can do that.”
Designation — a final step of a meandering process affording some protections on public land — still faces several hurdles.

Not all parties, for one, are on board with a policy move that would recognize a corridor spanning 2.6 million acres. Notably, rigid protections are only provided in geographic pinchpoints called bottlenecks, which account for roughly 27,000 acres. And only about half that area is covered because the other half is exempted private land. 
The Petroleum Association of Wyoming repeated its reservations about proceeding with the plans and asked Game and Fish to first study the oil and gas industry’s “benefits” to large ungulates. Pete Obermueller, the trade group’s president, cited research that has found some insect species capitalize on native, flowering vegetation planted on rehabilitated wellpads and alleged that the sites have “become rich feeding grounds for migrating ungulates.” 
“We continue to believe that there is insufficient data to indicate an officially designated corridor is warranted,” Obermueller wrote. 
The proposed Sublette Antelope Corridor overlaps with several large natural gas fields: the Anticline, Jonah and Normally Pressured Lance fields. Decades of monitoring GPS-collared pronghorn on the Anticline concluded that the native tawny-and-white residents are avoiding, and even abandoning, the drilled-out landscape.

Concern from the Petroleum Association of Wyoming and a handful of other industry groups halted Game and Fish’s first bid to designate the Sublette migration corridor before the governor’s executive order took the decision out of the department’s hands. 
Six years later, some of those industry groups have changed their tune and gone on record stating support for the designation — at least in part. 
“We support the consideration of the designation of the primary Sublette Corridor as identified in the assessment as the North Segment, Bondurant Segment, Foothills Segment, East of WY-191 and Central Segment,” Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna wrote in his comment letter. 
But cattlemen were less on board with designating the more peripheral reaches of the Sublette Pronghorn corridor. 
Designation of the “Calpet, Fontenelle, and Southwest Segments” should be considered separately, Magagna wrote, and the “East of Farson and Red Desert Segments” ought to be removed from “designation consideration at this time.” 
Even if the Game and Fish Commission agrees to designate the corridor, more layers remain.
Gordon would then have a say, and if the governor’s on board, he’d appoint an “area working group” consisting of county commissioners, hunting advocates, industry reps and others to review the corridor. That group would then make another recommendation, before the decision would swing one more time back to Gordon or a future governor.

(File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)State election officials have levied a fine of $700 against Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman, who subsequently closed his campaign account, clearing the way for him to take over as chair of the Maryland Democratic Party.
The campaign account could not be closed until Pittman cleared up discrepancies in his books, but as long as he had an account open, he could not fully assume the duties of party leadership that he won by acclamation almost 10 days ago at a party meeting.
Pittman’s campaign underreported $2,799.00 in contributions and $4,205.74 in expenditures, according to a June 26 letter from Allen Norfleet, director of candidacy and campaign finance for the Maryland State Board of Elections.
As a result, Norfleet imposed a civil penalty of $150 for each of the two infractions. Officials also imposed an additional $400 in penalties on the campaign: $200 each for failing to maintain both proper contribution and expenditure records.
By law, the civil penalty must come from the campaign account. If there is not enough money in the account, the chair and treasurer of the campaign committee are jointly responsible.
A spokesperson for the state party did not respond to a request for comment.
Norfleet confirmed that the account paid the fine the same day the fines were issued. The account was then closed, he said.
The remaining balance of nearly $41,000 was transferred from Pittman’s account to the state party — a move allowed by law.
The closure of the account clears the way for Pittman to fully step into the role of chair of the Maryland Democratic Party after being elected on June 21.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) tapped Pittman in May to head the party after then-Chair Ken Ulman announced he would resign by mid-June.
Pittman, who is in his second term as county executive, cannot seek a third term. But the term-limited Democrat still maintained a campaign finance account.
State law bars candidates from having their own campaign account while also serving as an officer on another account. The law is meant to prevent candidates from sidestepping campaign finance laws and donation limits.
And even though Pittman was term limited, state elections officials, and later Pittman himself, confirmed the prohibition applied.
The discrepancies in Pittman’s account, between his reported bank balance and the amount of cash his campaign claimed to have on hand, had been present in each of the Pittman campaign’s last two filings.
In an interview with Maryland Matters, Pittman vowed to “not even be quoted as party chair” until the issue was resolved.
Charlene Dukes, first vice chair of the party, has served as acting chair since Ulman’s resignation was official on June 13. The move allowed the party to continue raising and spending money.
Pittman is expected to step into that role once he assumes the chair position. As of Monday, Dukes was still listed as the chair of the party’s state campaign account, according to online records.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSC_0069-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker was living in Maryland when he was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop, as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.
A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Administration intends to deport Abrego Garcia to third country, DOJ lawyer says

Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.
Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial,” they said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey legislators diverted $45 million from national opioid settlement funds to four hospitals in the $58.8 billion state budget they approved Monday — a last-minute surprise that drove harm-reduction advocates to protest in the Statehouse and the state attorney general to object in unusual public criticism of state lawmakers.
Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), who chairs the Senate’s budget committee, said the diversion is meant to make up for losses the hospitals are expected to experience from federal Medicaid cuts.
“The thought process here is … to get some of the monies to some of the larger hospital systems for their harm reduction community-based programs, because they’re going to take a hit,” Sarlo said. “These hospitals are going to be on the front line of these Medicaid cuts.”
But Attorney General Matt Platkin said the hospitals will receive the money for uses not yet identified, despite a new five-year strategic plan a state advisory council released two weeks ago that requires beneficiaries to spend settlement funds on evidence-based solutions that help people recover from addiction.
The new appropriation, which he said he learned of Sunday night, “ignores” that plan, he added.
“These settlement funds are not general revenues for the State. They are the result of some of the most significant lawsuits ever filed by Attorneys General across this country to force companies to pay back the blood money that they stole in fueling the opioid epidemic,” Platkin said in a statement. “Spending this money in this way is a slap in the face to every family who lost a loved one in this devastating crisis, which continues to claim the lives of thousands of New Jerseyans each year.”
He warned lawmakers about “repeating the mistakes made with the state’s tobacco settlement funds, which should have been used exclusively to address damage caused by cigarettes.”
Harm reduction advocates echoed his concerns, accusing lawmakers of a “blatant misuse” of settlement funds in weekend deals brokered in secrecy.
Dozens lined a Statehouse hallway to implore passing legislators to vote against the allocation, as they waved tombstone-shaped signs with slogans including “Stealing sux! Fund harm redux!” and “Here lie legislators’ consciences.” They staged a die-in, partially blocking passers-by until state troopers intervened to move them along, and later, several were kicked out of the building after they unfurled a sign and began shouting during the Senate’s session.

Jenna Mellor heads the New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition and was a member of the advisory council, which spent 15 months hearing testimony from hundreds of people to devise its strategic plan.
“This was not in our recommendations,” Mellor said. “We gave very intentional recommendations for five areas that will save lives — harm reduction expansion, medicine for opioid use disorder, housing, wraparound services, and legal services. We will not be able to fund those things, if the hospitals keep getting this money.”
New Jersey will receive $1.1 billion in settlement funds through 2038, with half going to the state and the other half directly to county and local governments.
The $45 million going to hospitals in the coming budget year represents 10% of the state’s total share, as well as the single-biggest settlement fund expenditure in the fiscal year that begins Tuesday, advocates said. 
Racquel Romans-Henry, policy director of Salvation and Social Justice, joined advocates’ protest at the Statehouse.
“Historically in this state, hospitals have, for better or worse, been the source of a lot of the racial disparities that exist around health care,” Romans-Henry said. “Giving them this kind of money — when they neither need it and when so many grassroots organizations are reeling from federal cuts and are doing the work on the ground — is really a misalignment of the funds and the intent of the funds.”
Platkin urged legislators to reject the appropriation, but also vowed: “If they do not, my office will be carefully scrutinizing these hospital systems to make sure every single dollar is spent within the terms of the settlements we fought for years to obtain.”










Spending this money in this way is a slap in the face to every family who lost a loved one in this devastating crisis.


– Attorney General Matt Platkin


Four hospitals will receive the funds, advocates said. RWJBarnabas Health and Cooper University Hospital will get $15 million each, Hackensack University Medical Center will get $10 million, and Atlantic Health System will receive $5 million.
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy did not respond to a request for comment, but Sarlo said Murphy had signed off on the allocation.
Murphy’s former chief of staff, George Helmy, is an executive vice president at RWJ Barnabas and chief of its external affairs and policy office, while Cooper University Health Care is run by South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, another Murphy ally.
Bre Azanedo said grassroots organizations like Black Lives Matter-Paterson, where she serves as a program manager, are more trusted, effective harm reduction providers than hospitals. She also raised concerns about accountability.
“If they’re going to add ‘no deliverables, no strings attached,’ then that should also apply to us, as organizations,” Azanedo said. “They make us jump through hoops of fire for $20.”
Tonia Ahern, community coordinator for the National Center for Advocacy and Recovery, warned that “funding enormous health systems” won’t solve the overdose crisis.
“We hear horror stories all the time about people being mistreated and discriminated against at the hospital with no accountability,” Ahern said. “And what happens to people once they leave with no support, or access to medications and individualized care? It’s going to fall on harm reduction and recovery organizations to pick up the pieces, and now with less funding.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 



The request comes as part of a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence challenging the legality of the DOJ’s efforts to withhold funding awarded through its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in order to advance the administration’s priorities on gender ideology, DEI and immigration.
The lawsuit was filed on June 16 by lawyers representing the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, as well as Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is made up of 10 agencies and has received grants from OVW for over two decades. Brianna Henries, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence deferred comment to Democracy Forward.
“By forcing providers to choose between certifying compliance with unlawful conditions or giving up federal funding needed to help keep their communities safe, the Trump administration is holding funding hostage in an effort to force service providers to bend to the administration’s anti-DEI, anti-immigrant, and anti-trans goals,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “This is unlawful and threatens important programs preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting survivors.”
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has proposed a 29% cut to the OVW program’s funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget request. 
Under new DOJ guidelines, organizations cannot use federal funds for research projects, promoting or facilitating violations of federal immigration law, programs that discourage cooperation with law enforcement, or initiatives that promote gender ideology.
Organizations are also prohibited from engaging in “activities that frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
According to the lawsuit, the DOJ has started demanding that grant recipients certify they are complying with the conditions and could be subject to substantial penalties under the federal False Claims Act if they do not comply. Penalties include the potential withholding of funds, contract termination with the federal government and criminal prosecution.
Attorneys for the ACLU and the coalition claim such demands by the administration violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits “arbitrary and capricious” federal agency actions. They also argue the alleged quid-pro-quo for funding violates the First Amendment by “seeking to silence disfavored speech.”
“The new funding conditions are unconstitutional several times over,” the 49-page memo for the preliminary injunction states.
The grants were created under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act to help organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling. 
According to the lawsuit, added funding conditions force organizations into an “impossible” choice: give up crucial support or comply with rules that contradict their values and legal responsibilities.
$1 million in grants awarded to Rhode Island annually
The Rhode Island Coalition has an annual budget of roughly $5.3 million, of which approximately $3.4 million is passed through to member agencies. Roughly $1 million of that comes from Office on Violence Against Women grants, the coalition’s executive director, Lucy Rios, stated in an affidavit.
Federal grants and contracts accounted for 79% of the coalition’s revenue, according to its annual report.
The coalition has received grant funding in various program categories every year since at least 2001. It has sought training and technical assistance grants and other competitive discretionary grants, including $114,533 awarded for the period Oct. 1, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025. The lawsuit was filed ahead of a June 25 deadline to apply for a fiscal 2025 training and technical assistance grant that was anticipated in the amount of $113,574.
Rhode Island received $550,000 from the OVW in 2022 to create a safe visitation and exchange program for domestic violence survivors and their children — along with LGBTQ-related advocacy. The coalition also received a $350,000 grant to educate young men — particularly youth of color and immigrant communities — on the crimes of domestic and dating violence.
The coalition sought to continue the programs with additional grant funding, along with $900,000 to be used toward identifying potential high-risk cases for supervision and monitoring, according to the affidavit.
“Without access to this funding, vital programs that keep Rhode Islanders safe and keep our state at the forefront of addressing domestic violence are at risk, including RI’s first Safe Exchange and Supervised Visitation Center for families experiencing domestic violence,” Rios said in a June 16 statement. “We strive to be as courageous and resilient as the survivors in our communities as we stand up to protect the safety net for victims and infrastructure for prevention that we have been collectively building for nearly 50 years.”
A spokesperson for the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida PhoenixGov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a long-awaited state budget Monday just hours before it would take effect, vetoing $567 million.
The Legislature approved a $115.1 billion budget after a 105-day extended session, which is half-a-billion less than what the governor recommended before the session. However, during the budget signing ceremony and in ensuing press releases, the governor padded the size of the Legislature’s budget to include spending that does not all count toward the new fiscal year. 
DeSantis insisted that after his $567 million in budget vetoes, the total budget was $10 million more than his recommendation.
The 2025-2026 budget comes in less than the 2024-2025 budget, which was $117.46 billion.
“How many places are spending less year over year? Not a lot,” DeSantis said Monday morning when signing the budget in Wildwood.
DeSantis also canceled $750 million meant to bolster a reserve fund. Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez touted the plan to add the money in case of a recession. The fund will reach nearly $5 billion in the new budget. 
DeSantis explained that he didn’t think voters would like the idea of increasing the reserves; they can raise it themselves in November 2026 via a proposed constitutional amendment to raise the legal ceiling on the fund.
Albritton’s spokesperson declined to comment, and Perez’s office didn’t immediately respond to the Florida Phoenix’s request for comment on the veto of the large-ticket item the Legislature had emphasized.
“None of us know what the future holds,” Perez told reporters during budget negotiations in early June. “I think this is just a preparation of being prepared for the unexpected, and none of us know what the unexpected is, but we have a sample to look at in the 2000s when we had a recession.

Bye, bye business rent tax
Florida is the only state to assess a business rent tax. No longer is that the case, starting Tuesday.
“The Legislature has also done something that I’ve been asking for many years, and that’s eliminating a tax that only Florida has of all 50 states, and that’s taxing business rents. It’s not good for our economy. It’s not good for business growth. And so that tax is being sunsetted.” DeSantis said. 
In all, the plan is estimated to provide $1.3 billion in tax relief. 
Lawmakers passed a budget that eliminated 1,745 positions, or 1.5% of the authorized workforce. 
Among the budget vetoes is $14 million for Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office hangar, $4.4 million for public television stations, $1.3 million for public radio stations, $1.5 million for Broward County eviction prevention and rental assistance program, and $2.8 million for a Florida International University transportation efficiency program.
DeSantis vetoed the nearly $360,000 lawmakers set aside to conduct a pilot program on a bell-to-bell ban on cellphone use in six Florida school districts. 
The College of the Florida Keys Marine and Maritime Professional Institute was vetoed, a total of $1.99 million. 
OnBikes Pensacola was allocated $62,500 in the budget, but DeSantis vetoed that line item. One of OnBikes’ vice presidents is Rep. Alex Andrade, chair of the committee that probed Hope Florida, First Lady Casey DeSantis’ charity. 
Lawmakers had agreed to provide $750,000 for the construction of the Florida Museum of Black History in St. Augustine, but DeSantis vetoed its funding. 
Property taxes 
DeSantis vetoed $1 million to study the consequences of eliminating property taxes.
“We don’t need to give a bureaucracy money to study this. We know what needs to be done, so let’s just do it, and we will do it,” DeSantis said. 
“Property tax is going to require us to go to the ballot and get it done,” DeSantis said. “I know I spoke with President Albritton yesterday about it. He’s committed to do it. There’s no excuses. In the House of Representatives, we have almost a three-to-one Republican majority. Is there any possible excuse for why you can’t get it done?”
Vacancies
With former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez’s departure earlier this year, the lieutenant governor position remains vacant, as does the chief financial officer after now-U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis resigned to run for his new position. 
The governor said he has not made decisions on those positions but would in “relatively short order,” but not before the July 4 holiday weekend.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)State Climatologist Justin Glisan said the June 23 through June 29 reporting period was the “wettest” of the season, with precipitation totals 2-4 inches above normal in some areas. 
While the rain hindered some field work, it was overall beneficial for Iowa crops which continue to rate highly according to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said corn tassels are beginning to show, “signaling crop development remains on track.”

According to the report, around 3% of Iowa corn was beginning to silk and the crop rated 85% good or excellent. Soybeans were also a couple of days ahead of average, with 22% of the crop blooming across the state. Soybeans rated 77% good to excellent. 
“Last week brought multiple rounds of rain to much of the state, marking the wettest seven days of the growing season thus far,” Naig said. “In addition to benefitting the corn and soybeans, the moisture helps to replenish our streams, pastures and hay fields.” 
As a whole, the state averaged 2.81 inches for the reporting period, which was more than an inch and a half above normal. Precipitation maps show central and western parts of the state received the most rainfall during the period.

The rain pushed some areas, most severely north central and central Iowa, to hold excess soil moisture. Around 40% of topsoil moisture rated surplus in these regions and in north central Iowa, nearly 50% of subsoil had surplus moisture. 
The state average topsoil moisture condition rated 65% adequate and 21% surplus. Subsoil conditions on average were 70% adequate and 27% short. 
The first cutting of alfalfa hay all but wrapped up during the reporting period, with 97% completed across the state and 30% of the second cutting of hay complete. 
Oats also progressed, with 90% headed and 39% coloring. Iowa’s oat crop rated 83% good or excellent. 
In addition to heavy rainfall, it was also a hot week across the state. The statewide average high temperature for the week, at 92 degrees Fahrenheit, was 10 degrees above the normal. 
Forecasts for the coming week show Iowans can expect an inch or two of rain and slightly above average temperatures, which Naig said will be “pleasant conditions for a festive and fun Independence Day weekend filled with fireworks, cookouts and outdoor celebrations.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain temporarily in jail at the request of his own attorneys, who cited conflicting positions taken by the government over whether he is at risk for immediate deportation.
An order issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes keeps Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until a July 16 hearing in Nashville.
The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to appear in court for possible release, a move federal prosecutors oppose

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return. 
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country. 
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation. 
Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release. 
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation. 
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request. 
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

Outgoing Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba announced the reopening of Thalia Mara Hall during his final press conference held Monday on the arts venue’s steps. 
“Today marks what we view as a full circle moment, rejoicing in the iconic space where community has come together for decades in the city of Jackson,” Lumumba said. “Thalia Mara has always been more than a venue. It has been a gathering place for people in the city of Jackson. From its first class ballet performances to gospel concerts, Thalia Mara Hall has been the backdrop for our city’s rich cultural history.” 
Thalia Mara Hall closed last August after mold was found in parts of the building. The issues compounded from there, with malfunctioning HVAC systems and asbestos remediation. On June 6, the Mississippi State Fire Marshal’s Office announced that Thalia Mara Hall had finally passed inspection. 
“We’re not only excited to have overcome many of the challenges that led to it being shuttered for a period of time,” Lumumba said. “We are hopeful for the future of this auditorium, that it may be able to provide a more up-to-date experience for residents, inviting shows that people are able to see across the world, bringing them here to Jackson. So this is an investment in the future.”
In total, Emad Al-Turk, a city contracted engineer and owner of Al-Turk Planning, estimates that $5 million in city and state funds went into bringing Thalia Mara Hall up to code. 
The venue still has work to be completed, including reinstalling the fire curtain. The beam in which the fire curtain will be anchored has asbestos in it, so it will have to be remediated. In addition, a second air-conditioning chiller needs to be installed to properly cool the building. Until it’s installed, which could take months, Thalia Mara Hall will be operating at a lower seating capacity of about 800. 
“Primarily because of the heat,” Al-Turk said. “The air conditioning would not be sufficient to actually accommodate the 2,000 people at full capacity, but starting in the fall, that should not be a problem.”
Al-Turk said the calendar is open for the city to begin booking events, though none have been scheduled for July. 
“We’re very proud,” he said. “This took a little bit longer than what we anticipated, but we had probably seven or eight different contractors we had to coordinate with and all of them did a superb job to get us where we are today.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/18221431/Thalia-Mara-Hall.jpg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

(Screenshot)Update: This story was last updated at 11:45 p.m. Mountain time on June 29.
Two firefighters have been killed and another is injured after crews in North Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response.
Kootenai Health spokesperson Kim Anderson said three victims were brought to the Coeur d’Alene hospital, the Associated Press reported. Two were dead on arrival and the third is being treated for injuries, Anderson said, according to the AP.
The injured firefighter has been released from surgery, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a 9:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday press conference. Information about his injuries or their extent was not released.
“He is fighting for his life but is in stable condition,” the sheriff said.
The fire was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near the east side of Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene. The shooter opened fire around 2 p.m., Norris said. The sheriff said he believes the two incidents are related.
“We do believe that the suspect started the fire, and we do believe that it was an ambush and that it was intentional,” Norris said. “We do believe he started it, and it was totally intentional, what he did.”
At about 8:50 p.m. Sunday, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that a responding SWAT team located a dead man with a rifle nearby on Canfield Mountain.
A shelter-in-place order from the Kootenai County Emergency Management system has now been lifted, according to the sheriff’s office.

However, the brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, is still burning because firefighters had to suspend their response while the shooter was still active.
“There is still an active wildfire on Canfield Mountain,” Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Sunday night post on Facebook. “Local residents should be prepared and ready in the event that the situation escalates. Please continue to follow official sources for accurate information.”
Fire crews were unable to access the fire until it was deemed safe at around 7:30 p.m., the Idaho Department of Lands said in a press release.
“Crews estimate the fire to be about 15-20 acres, with numerous snags and steep terrain,” the press release says. “Additional resources including aircraft, heavy equipment, water tenders, engines, hand crews and a Type 3 Incident Management Team are on order and anticipated to work the fire tomorrow.”
The cause of the fire remains under investigation, the Department of Lands said in the release.
The Canfield Mountain area has been designated a no-fly zone, “including a strict prohibition on drone use,” the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in Sunday night press release. “Unauthorized aircraft or drones in the area pose a serious risk to firefighting and law enforcement operations.”
The sheriff urged the public to wait until official information is released by law enforcement to donate to funds to benefit the victims’ families. Scammers have been known to take advantage of tragedies like this and start GoFundMe fundraising campaigns without the consent of the families, he said.
 North Idaho shooter opens fire on firefighters responding to emergency call

“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said.
The responding fire crews, which included three engines, were dispatched from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue and the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.
One of the firefighters killed was from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, while the other was from the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department. The injured firefighter served the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, Norris said.
“There is a belief that (the shooter) ran and shot, so we don’t know what (evidence) we might be collecting once the fire threat diminishes,” Norris said.
Norris said the suspect’s body was removed from the scene to preserve it due to the threat of the fire.
The sheriff held two press conferences on Sunday: one at 4:30 p.m. Pacific, and one at 9:30 p.m.
“We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris said at 4:35 p.m. Pacific time. “This is an active situation. We have multiple agencies that are on scene from local and federal authorities, and we are prepared to neutralize this suspect who is currently, actively shooting at public safety personnel.”
The sheriff said “it appears modern-day sporting rifles are being used” in the attack.
Norris initially said law enforcement was unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers, but at the evening press conference, he said the ongoing investigation was pointing to one shooter. At the afternoon conference, he said officers and deputies were reporting from the scene that the shooter was “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said at the afternoon press conference. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Authorities are unsure whether the shooter was killed by responding officers or if he killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Norris said. He said an autopsy of the suspect’s body is scheduled in Spokane and would offer more information on how he died.
Multiple local North Idaho, state and federal agencies — an estimated 300 law enforcement officers, some from as far away as Montana — responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, said in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

 Idaho officials respond to Coeur d’Alene shooting

Kootenai County Commission chairman Bruce Mattare said the shooting was “senseless and tragic beyond words.”
“June 29, 2025, is a day that we will not forget in this community,” Mattare said at the evening press conference. “It is the day evil showed its face and we lost two outstanding professionals of the highest quality, and I cannot fathom why anyone would commit such a heinous act.”
The commissioner said this kind of “senseless violence is unheard of here” and does not reflect Coeur d’Alene as a community.
“When you hear how others portray the people who live here on the news, it’s not true,” Mattare said. “What happened here decades ago is not reflective of the fine people who live here today. And I want everyone to know that this is a wonderful place to live, to raise your family and visit.”
He stressed that resources were being provided at the state and federal level to investigate the killings and fire.
“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a post on X. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure and process the scene.

“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Rep. Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, both R-Idaho, also posted on X that they are monitoring the reports on the incident and are praying for the first responders and their families.
“I am monitoring the horrific reports out of Coeur d’Alene this evening,” Crapo posted. “I urge local residents to follow recommendations of law enforcement. My prayers are with victims and first responders.”
In a statement at 7 p.m. Sunday, Idaho House Republican leadership said they were “shocked by such a vicious attack.”
“We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues,” the statement said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Montana’s Republican senators over the weekend praised the removal of a provision to sell public lands from a federal budget reconciliation bill.
In a joint statement, U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy called the move “a victory for our Montana way of life.”
“We look forward to the final passage of the Big Beautiful Bill in order to prevent the largest tax increase in American history, secure the border, unleash American energy, and most importantly, implement President Trump’s America First agenda that Montanans – and folks across the country – overwhelmingly support and sent us here to enact.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who has led the push to sell off federal land for development, announced on social media over the weekend that he would not move forward with his provision as part of the One Big Beautiful bill before it advanced in the Senate.  The move follows strong opposition from members of Montana’s Congressional delegation and other elected officials, especially from Western states, as well as myriad conservation and outdoors groups.
“I continue to believe the federal government owns far too much land — land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation,” Lee posted in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. He said that the budget reconciliation process did not let him secure “clear, enforceable safeguards” to ensure the land sales would go to families, rather than corporations or foreign interests.
Lee originally introduced a provision that sought to sell millions of acres of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land to address the affordable housing crisis, specifically near urban areas in the West, but the Senate parliamentarian ruled against including it in the budget bill. A subsequent, slimmed down proposal still faced opposition from members of Lee’s own party, notably congressmen from Montana and Idaho.
On Saturday, Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy posted on X that he opposed the sale of public land and would vote against proceeding with the bill if the provision was included.  Shortly after, he said he would vote to move the bill along, but would lead an amendment to strip the land sales out.
Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously led the charge to remove a different land sale from an earlier version of the bill and decried Lee’s provision as a “poison pill,” released a statement on Sunday in response to Lee withdrawing his proposal.
“The SEALs taught me to Never Quit and to always rely on my teammates. Both were keys to our public lands victory. We always had backup plans, and we had the greatest coalition of support I’ve seen. Public lands are not red or blue, they are red, white and blue. They belong to all of us whether we’re from Massachusetts or Montana,” Zinke said. “I greatly appreciate the work of my colleagues in the House and Senate who were leaders either publicly or behind closed doors, particularly Senators Sheehy, Daines, Crapo, Risch, Chairman Simpson, and Speaker Johnson. And Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum who made it clear that mass land sales was not the Trump agenda. They are the Rough Riders.”
Several conservation and outdoor recreation groups released statements praising the actions taken to remove the land sale provision from the bill.
Chris Wood, president and CEO of the conservation organization Trout Unlimited said in a statement that protecting public lands is the “most nonpartisan issue in the country.
“Public lands are the cornerstone of our conservation legacy, uniting us with the last best places this country has to offer. We thank the members of Congress who have joined hundreds of thousands of outdoorsmen and women in opposing widespread public land selloffs in reconciliation. This is certainly not the first attempt to privatize or transfer our public lands, and it won’t be the last. We must stay vigilant and defend the places we love to fish, hike, hunt, and explore,” Wood said.
On Monday, the Senate continued to slog through dozens of amendment votes on President Donald Trump’s priority policy proposal, which includes extending and expanding the Trump tax cuts enacted in 2017, adding restrictions to Medicaid, expanding investments in immigration and border policy, and making cuts to Biden-era climate change and student debt relief programs.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Fee hikes for hunting and fishing licenses, workplace protections for immigrants and increased requirements for gun dealers are among the Washington state laws going into effect July 1. 
Drivers can also expect increased prices at the pump as a 6-cent hike in Washington’s gas tax goes into effect Tuesday, the start of the state’s 2026 fiscal year.
Dozens more laws will take effect July 27, which marks 90 days after the legislative session adjourned. Others passed in Olympia this year have longer lead times.
For now, these bills have a few weeks’ head start.
License fees
Throughout the most recent legislative session, which ended in April, Republicans in Olympia repeatedly accused Democrats of “taxing the joy” out of Washington. 
Senate Bill 5583 is one reason why. The legislation raises fees for hunting and fishing licenses 38%. For example, the big game deer license will jump from $39 to $53.82. A combination freshwater and saltwater fishing license will increase from $45.50 to $62.79.
Prices for Washingtonians over 70 years old are discounted. 
The fee increases are expected to raise about $19.6 million in the next two years. A fiscal analysis assumed license sales would drop 11% due to the price hike. The proceeds go to the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.
The legislation passed on razor-thin margins, including a one-vote difference in the state Senate as some Democrats joined Republicans in opposition. Gov. Bob Ferguson signed it into law last month.
For many Washingtonians, fishing and hunting are “allowing young kids to go out with their grandma and grandpa, maybe kids that couldn’t afford to do other things,” said Rep. April Connors, R-Kennewick. “By increasing these fees, we are putting a barrier on people who are lower income.”
It’s one of a number of tax hikes Democrats pushed through to address a budget shortfall pegged between $12 billion and $16 billion over the next four years. 
“Inflation does continue to go up. These fees have not gone up. It is time to do that,” said Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, in floor debate in April. “We are in a budget crisis and we do need to tighten our belts and be responsible, and this is part of that.”
Lawmakers also raised the price of an annual Discover Pass to access state lands from $30 to $45. That change goes into effect Oct. 1.
Coercing immigrants
A new law going into effect Tuesday aims to protect workers from coercion by their employer based on immigration status.
Workplace coercion could be used to violate wage or agricultural labor laws. For example, if an employee’s boss mentions someone’s immigration status before asking them to work unpaid overtime.
Workers can now file complaints about such threats to the state Department of Labor and Industries, under Senate Bill 5104. Maximum civil penalties range from $1,000 for the first violation to $10,000 for a third. 
New Jersey passed similar legislation last year.
Gun sellers
The Legislature passed House Bill 2118 in 2024 to impose stricter requirements on gun dealers. 
Advocates said the legislation will help keep guns out of the wrong hands. Opponents argued the regulations would be costly to implement and force dealers out of business despite gun thefts from licensed sellers being rare.
Among the new requirements are increased security measures and 24-hour deadlines for responding to police requests to help track guns used in crimes and report lost or stolen firearms. Dealers’ video surveillance systems, for example, must film entrances and exits, anywhere firearms are displayed and where transactions occur. Some of the recordings must be kept for 90 days. 
All employees must be over 21 years old and undergo fingerprinting and background checks before selling any guns. And they have to get background checks each year after that.
Dealers with monthly sales under $1,000 are exempt from the new requirements.
The bill passed along party lines, with Democrats in support. This year, lawmakers considered going further in the state’s requirements for gun dealers, but that measure stalled.
Equal pay
Passed in 2024, House Hill 1905 updates Washington’s equal pay law to prohibit workplace discrimination based on membership in a protected class. This includes wage discrimination or discrimination in career advancement. The Equal Pay and Opportunities Act previously only focused on gender. 
Protected classes now covered include age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship status, military status or disability. 
Employers can still vary compensation based on education, experience, training, seniority or a merit system.
Violating the law can be punished by a misdemeanor. 
Crimes on tribal lands
A new state law aims to stop criminal suspects from fleeing Washington’s tribal lands to evade law enforcement. 
Senate Bill 6146 authorizes police to enforce warrants that the state’s federally recognized tribes issue, and bring fugitives back to reservations to face prosecution. 
Tribes have recognized state warrants since 1854, but that practice hasn’t been reciprocated. 
“The safety of all Washingtonians is a responsibility across governmental families, and SB 6146 responds to those victims of crimes, from drug dealers to domestic violence,” state Rep. Debra Lekanoff, D-Anacortes, said in a statement last year. Lekanoff is the only Native American woman serving in the state House.
Since passing with unanimous support in the Legislature last year, a task force has worked on how to implement the new law. Out of that work came legislation that lawmakers approved this year to make some changes to last year’s law.
Trafficking
Hundreds of children in Washington are victims of sex trafficking every year. 
Lawmakers unanimously passed Senate Bill 6006 last year to better identify these minors. The new law adds trafficking to the definition of abuse or neglect that mandatory reporters would have to report. And state agencies must use a validated assessment tool to screen children for commercial sexual abuse.
Victims can also now ask for a sexual assault protection order based on commercial sexual exploitation. Police can also file petitions on their behalf. Denials of these civil orders can’t be based on the person consenting to sex.
Under the law, the state Department of Children, Youth and Families must offer services to children identified as survivors of sex trafficking. 
The measure also removes the statute of limitations for some statutes used to prosecute traffickers.
“Currently, survivors of sex trafficking do not have the same rights and access to the services and support that survivors of childhood sexual assault do,” said the bill’s sponsor Sen. Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond. “These sexually exploited children are not criminals; they are victims. This bill continues to ensure we recognize that even though their abuse is paid for, they deserve the same access to services and support. That is justice.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1571-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

In honor of the late Congressman Pat Williams, Gov. Greg Gianforte ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at all State buildings on July 2 and 3, the family said in a news release.
A celebration of life for Williams will be held at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, July 15, in Missoula at the Dennison Theater at the University of Montana.
Williams, a Democrat from Butte, died of natural causes on June 25 at the age of 87.
Williams served 18 years in Congress, more consecutive terms in the U.S. House than anyone in Montana history.
His body will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda in Helena from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Wednesday, July 2, and from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Thursday, July 3, his family said in the news release. He will then be transported to Butte for a private family burial.
The Williams family will host the celebration of life in Missoula on July 15 at the Dennison Theater. Doors will open at 3 p.m. for the 4 p.m. event, and a reception will take place at 5:30 p.m.
Following news of his death last week, Montanans praised Williams’ legacy of public service.
“Susan and I join Montanans in commemorating the life and legacy of former Montana Congressman Pat Williams,” said Gianforte, a Republican, in a statement. “As Montana’s longest-serving congressman, Pat championed Montana’s interests, working to find common ground for nearly 20 years in Washington. He was a dedicated public servant. We ask all Montanans to keep his wife Carol and their children in your prayers.”
Democratic Minority Leaders Sen. Pat Flowers of Belgrade and Rep. Katie Sullivan of Missoula said although Williams was known for his federal service, he began his political career “in the stomping grounds of the Montana State Legislature.”
“As current state legislators, and as minority leaders for House and Senate Democrats, we not only honor Pat’s legendary service at the federal level, but also his hard work in Montana’s Capitol, where he began his lifelong career of looking out for children and working families,” said Flowers and Sullivan in a joint statement. “His contributions to the state will not be forgotten, and we will continue to honor his memory.
“His family, and the state of Montana, should feel eternally grateful and proud that Pat brought his hard-working Butte, Montana, values all the way to Washington, D.C., and applied them to create better lives for all Americans.”
Memorials can be made to the Pat Williams Artists Scholarship at the University of Montana or The Williams Family Fund.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pat_butte-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-30 22:08:40+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Hurdles waiting in the shadows’: Lumumba reflects on challenges and triumphs on final day as Jackson mayor,Anna Wolfe and Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/30/lumumba-on-final-day-as-jackson-mayor/,Chokwe Antar Lumumba is ending his second term as mayor of Mississippi's capital city. He pledged to make Jackson the most radical city in America but spent most of his time dealing with emergencies.,"On his last day as mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba recounted accomplishments, praised his executive team and said he has no plans to seek office again.
He spoke during a press conference outside of the city’s Thalia Mara Hall, which was recently cleared for reopening after nearly a year of remediation. The briefing, meant to give media members a peek inside the downtown theater, marked one of Lumumba’s final forays as mayor.
Longtime state Sen. John Horhn — who defeated Lumumba in the Democratic primary runoff — will be inaugurated as mayor Tuesday, but Lumumba won’t be present. Not for any contentious reason, the 42-year-old mayor noted, but because he returns to his private law practice Tuesday.
“I’ve got to work now, y’all,” Lumumba said. “I’ve got a job.”
Thalia Mara Hall’s presumptive comeback was a fitting end for Lumumba, who pledged to make Jackson the most radical city in America but instead spent much of his eight years in office parrying one emergency after another. The auditorium was built in 1968 and closed nearly 11 months ago after workers found mold caused by a faulty HVAC system – on top of broken elevators, fire safety concerns and vandalism.
“This job is a fast-pitched sport,” Lumumba said. “There’s an abundance of challenges that have to be addressed, and it seems like the moment that you’ve gotten over one hurdle, there’s another one that is waiting in the shadows.” 
Outside the theater Monday, Lumumba reflected on the high points of his leadership instead of the many crises — some seemingly self-inflicted — he faced as mayor. 
He presided over the city during the coronavirus pandemic and the rise in crime it brought, but also the one-two punch of the 2021 and 2022 water crises, exacerbated by the city’s mismanagement of its water plants, and the 18-day pause in trash pickup spurred by Lumumba’s contentious negotiations with the city council in 2023. 
Then in 2024, Lumumba was indicted alongside other city and county officials in a sweeping federal corruption probe targeting the proposed development of a hotel across from the city’s convention center, a project that has remained stalled in a 20-year saga of failed bids and political consternation. 
Slated for trial next year, Lumumba has repeatedly maintained his innocence. 
The city’s youngest mayor also brought some victories to Jackson, particularly in his first year in office. In 2017, he ended a furlough of city employees and worked with then-Gov. Phil Bryant to avoid a state takeover of Jackson Public Schools. In 2019, the city successfully sued German engineering firm Siemens and its local contractors for $89 million over botched work installing the city’s water-sewer billing infrastructure.
“I think that that was a pivotal moment to say that this city is going to hold people responsible for the work that they do,” Lumumba said. 
Lumumba had more time than any other mayor to usher in the 1% sales tax, which residents approved in 2014 to fund infrastructure improvements.
“We paved 144 streets,” he said. “There are residents that still are waiting on their roads to be repaved. And you don’t really feel it until it’s your street that gets repaved, but that is a significant undertaking.”
And under his administration, crime has fallen dramatically recently, with homicides cut by a third and shootings cut in half in the last year.
Lumumba was first elected in 2017 after defeating Tony Yarber, a business-friendly mayor who faced his own scandals as mayor. A criminal justice attorney, Lumumba said he never planned to seek office until the stunning death of his father, Chokwe Lumumba Sr., eight months into his first term as mayor in 2014.
“I can say without reservation, and unequivocally, we remember where we started. We are in a much better position than we started,” Lumumba said. 
Lumumba said he has sat down with Horhn in recent months, answered questions “as extensively as I could,” and promised to remain reachable to the new mayor.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01231358/Lumumba-6.jpg,,,2025-06-30 19:07:05.129551

According to a Monday press release, Reynolds signed Executive Order 13 on June 27, which included orders for the Iowa Board of Regents to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, review policies at state universities and conduct another review next year of any policy changes and the response to any new acts of antisemitism.
The first review must be completed by November, the executive order stated, with a report due to Reynolds on Dec. 1. Follow-up reviews will operate on the same timeline.
“Since the October 7th attacks, we’ve seen an increase in antisemitism across the U.S., including on college campuses,” Reynolds said in the release. “While many of Iowa’s colleges and universities have condemned such activity, we want to be clear that antisemitism has no place in Iowa.”
Also included in the executive order is a directive for the Iowa Department of Education to provide educational materials and resources to public and nonpublic Iowa schools about Jewish history, the Holocaust and Israel.
Using data from the Anti-Defamation League’s 2024 Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, the executive order states Iowa saw a 40% increase in antisemitic incidents between 2023 and 2024, and a 92% increase since 2020. Reynolds previously spoke about rising antisemitism when responding to pro-Palestine protests on Iowa college campuses.
“The State of Iowa reiterates its longstanding support for Israel and Iowa’s Jewish community, and continues to condemn any form of threat, harassment, intimidation, hate speech, or other action that endangers the Jewish community or violates state or federal law,” the executive order stated.

Patty Murray tried to remove language from the bill that would block Medicaid payments from going to Planned Parenthood for one year unless the organization stops performing abortions.Federal law already bars funding from going toward abortions, with limited exceptions, but GOP lawmakers have proposed blocking any other funding from going to the organization, effectively blocking Medicaid patients from going to Planned Parenthood for other types of health care.Murray said the proposal would have a detrimental impact on health care for lower-income women and called it a “long-sought goal of anti-choice extremists.”“Republicans' bill will cut millions of women off from birth control, cancer screenings, essential preventive health care — care that they will not be able to afford anywhere else,” Murray said. “And it will shutter some 200 health care clinics in our country.”Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith opposed efforts to remove the policy change and raised a budget point of order, which was not waived following a 49-51 vote. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski voted with Democrats.“There was a time when protecting American tax dollars from supporting the abortion industry was an uncontroversial, nonpartisan effort that we could all get behind,” Hyde-Smith said.Medicaid for undocumented immigrantsSenators from both political parties crossed the aisle over whether the federal government should reduce how much a state is given for its Medicaid program if that state uses its own taxpayer dollars to enroll immigrants living in the country without proper documentation.The provision was included in an earlier version of the bill, but the Senate parliamentarian ruled it didn’t comply with the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill.The vote was 56-44, but since it was on waiving a budget point of order, at least 60 senators had to agree to set aside the rules and move forward with the amendment, so the vote failed.Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia voted with GOP senators. Maine’s Collins voted with most of the chamber’s Democrats against moving forward.Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn asked for the vote, saying he believes the policy change would reduce undocumented immigration.“Border patrol talks about push and pull factors,” Cornyn said. “One of the pull factors for illegal immigration is the knowledge that people will be able to receive various benefits once they make it into the country.”Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., opposed Cornyn’s attempt to get the language back in the bill, saying the policy change would financially harm states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 health care law for simple mistakes.“What this amendment says is that if one person, despite state law, through a bureaucratic mistake, is receiving funds, then the whole state pays the price and has their rate on expanded Medicaid changed from 90% to 80%,” Merkley said, referring to the percentage paid by the federal government.Reduction in funding for Consumer Financial Protection BureauAn amendment to stop a nearly 50% reduction in funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was blocked by Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.Sen.

Approved by lawmakers in April, the laws would prohibit social media platforms from promoting addictive behavior and allow parents to sue if their child is harmed due to content they’re exposed to.
NetChoice argued in a lawsuit filed Friday that the laws violate the First Amendment and are preempted by the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online service providers from being sued for content created by users, according to the complaint.
Federal judge declares Arkansas social media age-verification law unconstitutional

Plaintiffs are asking a judge to declare the Arkansas laws unconstitutional and block them from going into effect. 
Friday, Eldredge & Clark, LLP from Arkansas and Clement & Murphy, PLLC from Virginia filed the lawsuit against Attorney General Tim Griffin and the state’s 28 prosecuting attorneys in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. 
Act 900 amends the state’s Social Media Safety Act, a 2023 law a federal judge permanently blocked in March. Amendments include prohibiting social media platforms from engaging in practices “to evoke any addiction or compulsive behaviors” in minors, and changing the definition of a minor to someone 16-years-old or younger.
NetChoice contends the amended Social Media Safety Act is “even more of an affront to the First Amendment” than its original version because it prohibits evoking addictive and compulsive behavior without clearly defining those terms. 
The complaint questions, for example, how many times a day users could check their social media account each day for it to be considered compulsive, and notes that the vague language would create a chilling effect on free speech by forcing people “to steer far wider of the unlawful zone” than they would if the law had clear boundaries.   
Act 901 allows parents to sue social media platforms if exposure to content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, commiting or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds.
NetChoice Associate Director of Litigation Paul Taske said in a press release that it “violates the free speech rights of Arkansans and wastes taxpayer dollars on unconstitutional censorship.”
“Politicians cannot control what protected speech you see, say or share online — according to the Supreme Court itself. We are again suing the government of Arkansas to stop it,” Taske said. “Parents — not bureaucrats — should control how their children engage online.”


Let us know what you think...


 

While NetChoice’s members “strongly oppose” speech that promotes eating disorders or self-harm and already prohibit such content, the complaint argues that Arkansas’ new laws “impose even more restrictions and draconian sanctions” on social media platforms.
“By banning speech based on what impact it ultimately has on any user of the online service, the law sweeps in all manner of constitutionally protected expression that NetChoice members currently disseminate,” the complaint states.
Plaintiffs argue that parents already have several ways to restrict kids’ access to online services. Additionally, NetChoice members like Facebook and YouTube offer several parental controls to protect minors online, and have adopted policies prohibiting harmful content, according to the complaint.
NetChoice sued Arkansas two years ago over the Social Media Safety Act, which required age verification to create new social media accounts. The law was a priority for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office, and would have been the first law of its kind in the nation.
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction about two weeks before the law was set to take effect in 2023. The judge declared the law unconstitutional in March. Griffin filed a notice of appeal.
Two days after the judge’s ruling, Arkansas lawmakers filed two bills that supporters said were aimed at expanding social media protections for children. Both were sponsored by the lawmakers who ran the 2023 social media legislation, Republicans Sen. Tyler Dees of Siloam Springs and Rep. Jon Eubanks of Paris. The governor signed them into law in April.
The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks, the same federal judge who struck down the Social Media Safety Act.

(Greenleaf123 | Getty Images)In light of a decision issued by the United States Supreme Court earlier this month, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will now reconsider a case initially settled last year in which the court ruled it was discriminatory for states to ban individuals with government-sponsored health insurance from using that coverage for gender-affirming care.
The U.S. Supreme Court vacated the lower court’s decision in that case on Monday, according to the court docket. The higher court said the case should be reconsidered by the Fourth Circuit “in light of United States v. Skrmetti.”
The Skrmetti decision was issued on June 18. Supreme Court justices in that case ruled 6-3 to uphold a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors. The majority said that children who seek such treatment don’t qualify as a protected class. Since they are not being denied the medications due to their sex, barring the treatments is not discrimination.
Upon release of the decision, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he was “optimistic” that the ruling would allow West Virginia to enforce other anti-trans policies that have been subject to court challenges — specifically, he said, the state law passed in 2021 that would bar trans children from playing on school sports teams that match their gender identity.
Action has yet to be taken on the trans sports law challenge, but it’s clear the order has opened the door for further consideration of — and overturning of decisions in — related cases.
The case now set to be reconsidered was originally filed as two separate cases — one for North Carolina and another for West Virginia. The cases were combined in 2023 following oral arguments in front of 4th Circuit judges.
The West Virginia plaintiff in the case is Shauntae Anderson, a trans woman who sued the former state Department of Health and Human Resources to challenge a 2004 law outlawing state coverage via Medicaid for gender-affirming surgeries due to gender dysphoria. 
In their initial ruling, the Fourth Circuit judges upheld decisions by lower courts in both North Carolina and West Virginia saying that state health care plans — specifically Medicaid in West Virginia — were obligated to cover certain health services for trans people, including gender-affirming surgeries for adults. 
“These two cases present the same question: Do health care plans that cover medically necessary treatments for certain diagnoses but bar coverage of those same medically necessary treatments for a diagnosis unique to transgender patients violate either the Equal Protection Clause or other provisions of federal law?” Judge Roger Gregory posed in the ruling. “We hold that they do, and therefore affirm the judgments of the district courts.”
Gregory presented the example of mastectomies and breast-reduction surgeries — which are covered by West Virginia Medicaid for diagnoses like cancer and excess breast tissue, but not for the legitimate diagnosis of gender dysphoria. 
To offer coverage in one case but not the other, the ruling read, is “obviously discriminatory.”
In a statement to the Associated Press last year, Anderson said West Virginia’s refusal to cover such procedures was “dehumanizing.”
According to a 2021 study, less than 1% of trans or gender-nonconforming adults who receive gender-affirming surgery nationwide regret their procedures. Most report lower rates of depression, suicidality and anxiety following receiving the care.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gavel-getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa have refiled their lawsuit against the Des Moines Register and its former pollster, J. Ann Selzer, over the results of a 2024 Iowa Poll.
In an apparent move to keep Miller-Meeks and a former state representative as plaintiffs in the case, attorneys for the president dismissed their case in federal court on Monday while refiling their lawsuit in state court.
The lawsuit was initiated in December 2024 when Trump sued the Register, its parent company, Gannett, and Selzer in Polk County District Court, alleging the newspaper’s Iowa Poll, which was published shortly before the Nov. 5 election, deliberately overstated support for the Democratic nominee for president, Vice President Kamala Harris, by 16 percentage points.
Trump argued the poll amounted to “brazen election interference” and violated Iowa’s Consumer Fraud Act. The defendants have denied the claims.
Attorneys for the president later expanded the lawsuit, adding claims by Miller-Meeks, a Republican who narrowly won reelection in the state’s 1st Congressional District, and by Brad Zaun, a former Republican state senator from Urbandale, who lost his bid for reelection.
At the defendants’ request, the case was transferred to federal court. However, a legal dispute soon arose over whether federal court was the proper forum for the case given the fact that Miller-Meeks and Zaun, like the defendants, are based in Iowa.
On May 23, 2025, a federal judge denied Trump’s motion to remand the case from federal court back to state court. In that decision, the court allowed the president to file an appeal on the issue but also ordered Trump to file an amended complaint removing Miller-Meeks and Zaun from the case, eliminating any claims that were exclusive to the two Iowa-resident plaintiffs.
Trump was facing a July 18 deadline to file an amended complaint in federal court.
On Monday, the attorneys for the president filed a notice of dismissal in the federal case, notifying the court they were dropping their case without prejudice – indicating there was no settlement to the case and it could be refiled at a later date.
At roughly the same time, the president’s attorneys refiled the lawsuit in Polk County District Court, with Miller-Meeks and Zaun rejoining the president as co-plaintiffs.
As before, the lawsuit claims Selzer’s actions “impacted many other elections, including Rep. Miller-Meeks’ contest” and Zaun’s race against Democrat challenger Matt Blake in Iowa Senate District 22. “Selzer’s polling ‘miss’ was not an astonishing coincidence — it was intentional,” the lawsuit alleges. “As President Trump observed, ‘She knew exactly what she was doing.’”
The defendants in the case have yet to file a formal response to the newest court filing but have already denied the allegations in previous court filings.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

(Courtesy photos)Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) on Monday morning announced his candidacy in the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary for New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands, committing to build on the work of Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard and her predecessors.
Jonas Moya, a rancher from Tucumcari and former Biden-appointed state director for the Farm Service Agency, announced his candidacy on June 24.
Juan Sanchez, a former natural resource specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and consultant for the New Mexico Acequia Commission, first joined the race in April.
As of Monday, no Republican candidates had filed to run, according to New Mexico Secretary of State data.
Voters in 2024 reelected McQueen to a two-year term in the state House of Representatives. Brian Morris, McQueen’s campaign manager, told Source NM on Monday that McQueen is not running for re-election to his House seat in the 2026 election, and instead running for Land Commissioner.
This means McQueen’s seat in the House will be on the primary and general election ballots next year, for the new term set to begin in January 2027, Morris said.
McQueen and Moya’s announcements both highlighted their intentions to protect public lands, and their opposition to a controversial and now defunct proposal in the U.S. Congress to sell federal lands.
McQueen’s announcement touts his work during six terms as a state lawmaker, including his co-sponsorship of reforms at the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and the state’s Strategic Water Reserve, and his support for the Land Grant Permanent Fund, which collects oil and gas royalties and primarily pays out to schools, universities and hospitals.
“I’m proud that New Mexico is now the first state in the nation to constitutionally guarantee our youngest children the right to early childhood education,” he said. “With responsible public land management, we can ensure that all our public institutions are receiving the funds necessary to ensure our children a successful future.”
Moya said the job of public lands commissioner is about protecting the fund and ensuring it benefits the public.
“It means balancing energy development with environmental stewardship, expanding outdoor access, and honoring the communities who’ve cared for this land for generations — tribes, acequia associations, and land grant heirs alike,” he said.
Moya’s announcement states that at the Farm Service Agency, he led disaster relief efforts, supported farmers and ranchers through drought and hardship and helped deliver hundreds of millions in aid.
“My word is my bond. That’s how I was raised — and that’s how I’ll lead. I’ll listen to the people who live on and work the land, not the political insiders,” Moya said. “Together, we can restore trust, protect our heritage, and build a better future for all New Mexicans.”

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)Community college leaders and advocates say they are feeling confused and left out of conversations that led to the list of eligible career fields for the Last-Dollar Scholarship program being cut down by one-third.
The Last-Dollar Scholarship program is a state-funded initiative to help students attending community colleges bridge the gap between financial aid and what’s left of tuition and fees that still need to be paid.
The Iowa Workforce Development Board voted in May to eliminate high-demand jobs in law enforcement, medical fields and more even though community college officials say the program is likely keep its streak of being underspent.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Students must be enrolled in academic programs corresponding to “high-demand” careers as determined by the state in order to receive their funding. Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said all 66 of the careers recommended by the organization fit the criteria to be included, but the state workforce board still voted to remove 20 occupations. The list is reviewed every two years, she said.
“When we’re helping students who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford college to afford it in any high demand area, then we’re helping the workforce,” Shields said. “The Legislature put a definition of high demand into code for this program, and everything we’ve recommended meets that definition.”
Shorter list eliminates public safety, health care jobs
Occupations removed from the list span criminal justice fields for law enforcement and firefighters, medical assisting, dental hygiene, dental assisting and wastewater, Shields said, alongside more “support function” roles like web design and secretarial work.
While the jobs list was cut by around one-third, Shields said there isn’t a one-to-one transfer to academic programs that can feed into those careers. In reality, she said about half of the academic programs cleared for Last-Dollar Scholarship recipients will no longer qualify for incoming students, according to calculations made by Iowa College Aid.
“Those are all programs that lead into occupations that are really critical right now in our communities,” Shields said.
Matt Thompson, president of Indian Hill Community College, who spoke alongside Shields during the meeting’s public comment section, said the change to the list will impact the community college’s future students and programs.
While students currently receiving a Last-Dollar Scholarship will continue to see support until their program is completed, Thompson said as many as 2,500 students will not be able to benefit from the scholarship while trying to earn the same credentials.
“When we work with a student population that is sometimes underrepresented, if not underresourced, having access to the Last-Dollar Scholarship program makes a huge difference in whether they plan to attend college or not,” Thompson said.
Program spending falls short of funding
This cut in programs comes as the Last-Dollar Scholarship program looks to be underspent for another year, college leaders say, after changes to student eligibility and among uncertainty surrounding federal financial aid.
According to the Last-Dollar Scholarship website, in fiscal year 2024 the state awarded $18.3 million in scholarships to more than 8,000 students, with an average award amount of just under $2,300. At Indian Hills Community College, 467 students received the scholarship in 2024.
Two years ago, the program was underspent by almost $6 million, Shields said, and while final numbers are not yet available, it seems like the program being underspent once again is a likely outcome. According to legislation signed this year by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, the scholarship program fund will receive almost $24 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
“I’ll add the caveat to all of that, that there is so much uncertainty with federal student aid right now, and since this is a last dollar scholarship, it will be significantly impacted by that,” Shields said. “So it is very, very hard to make predictions about what that’s going to look like.”
The board itself was split on whether to adopt the larger list recommended by community colleges or the state’s shorter list, with a proposed amendment to swap the state list for the college one failing with a 7-6 vote.
Board member Nick Glew said during the meeting he approached this decision from the perspective of needing to do whatever is possible to boost the workforce in Iowa. He said following community colleges’ recommendations would be the best decision for Iowans “as a whole,” because the colleges work with employers to provide the programming that best meets the businesses’ and students’ needs.
“I’m kind of disappointed that we have to kind of arm wrestle on this a little bit and figure out what the right way to go is,” Glew said.
Kelly Barrick, a board member who favored using the shorter list, disagreed that the longer list was appropriate due to the program being underspent. She said it’s not about getting anyone who studies for a job in Iowa money, but ensuring that it is well-spent within established parameters. Focusing on areas with the most need, like advanced manufacturing and health care, for the program will help fill the state’s most in-demand jobs.
Shields said the workforce board used to have a representative from the colleges as a member, but this was changed a few years ago. This year, the organization and colleges were told they could only participate through public comment.
She was told at a later meeting that Iowa code requires the board to work with the Iowa Board of Regents on their list of applicable jobs for the Iowa Workforce Grant but not community colleges.
“There has been more collaboration in the past, so this year was a little surprising on that front,” Shields said.
If community colleges had been consulted or had the opportunity to speak with the board before the list was finalized, Thompson said he would have been happy to go over all of the programs and see what compromises both groups could come to.
“We would just like to have the ability to sit down and have the conversation and plan with Iowa Workforce Development, and that just didn’t happen,” Thompson said.

Bowing to opposition from President Trump, the Healey administration on Monday put its offshore wind plans on hold yet again and said it is committed to an “all-of-the-above approach to energy.”
The post Healey again puts offshore wind on back burner appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","BOWING TO OPPOSITION from President Trump, the Healey administration on Monday put its offshore wind plans on hold yet again and said it is committed to an “all-of-the-above approach to energy.” 
Price negotiations between the state’s utilities and two offshore wind developers were supposed to wrap up on Monday, but the parties filed a brief statement saying they couldn’t reach a deal “due to ongoing uncertainty caused by federal level activities.” The deadline was pushed back to December 31, the third time the timeline has been extended since Trump was elected. 
One wind farm – Vineyard Wind – is currently under construction off the Massachusetts coast. Bids for two other wind farms were accepted by the Healey administration in September 2024, but the developers and the state’s three utilities have been unable to reach agreement on a pricing contract because of the uncertainty in Washington.  
The new delay – and the likelihood that offshore wind contract deadlines will continue to be extended as long as Trump is in office – means Gov. Maura Healey will need to come up with a new climate strategy. The current strategy relies heavily on electrifying the housing and transportation sectors, but that approach will only reduce greenhouse gas emissions if the electricity being used is generated without fossil fuels.  
Offshore wind farms were expected to play a key role in decarbonizing electricity production, but Trump’s opposition to new and existing offshore wind projects has cast a pall over the industry. Republicans in the US Senate are now trying to deliver a death blow, doing away with existing tax credits and proposing a new excise tax on solar and wind projects that could drive prices up by an estimated 10 to 20 percent. 
Healey has not come up with a Plan B climate strategy yet, although a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy Resources issued a one-paragraph statement hinting at a new approach. 
“Massachusetts is committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, including offshore wind,” said the statement. “Offshore wind produced locally in Massachusetts will help lower costs, create thousands of jobs, and move us toward energy independence.” 
What’s unclear is what’s included in the all-of-the-above approach. An administration spokesperson did not respond to a request for clarification. Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the Senate chair of the Legislature’s Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee, said he could only guess the governor’s intent. “I think the plain meaning of the words should be a guide,” he said. 
When former Gov. Charlie Baker used the “all-of-the-above” phrase in 2015, he said he wanted to develop solar and offshore wind as well as bring more natural gas into the region. Healey opposed pipeline expansion in 2015 and has bragged in the past about blocking gas pipelines coming into the region. 
Even so, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul succeeded in convincing Trump to allow an offshore wind farm off the coast of her state to resume construction after she agreed to consider adding natural gas pipeline capacity. 
Two other energy options available to Massachusetts are importing more hydro-electricity from Canada and expanding the region’s nuclear power capacity. Massachusetts has already procured additional hydro-electricity from Quebec and is now waiting for the transmission line that will carry the power into New England to be completed. 
Barrett said he thinks nuclear power expansion is more likely than construction of a new gas pipeline, but he acknowledged that there is a lot of uncertainty right now on the energy front. 
One of the developers, Ocean Winds, has indicated it will not move forward until the situation in Washington becomes clearer. In a filing earlier this month with state regulators, Ocean Winds said Massachusetts should review the situation every quarter until the federal outlook becomes more stable or Trump leaves office in 2029. 
Avangrid, the other wind farm developer, submitted a heavily redacted filing to state regulators that didn’t say whether it would proceed with its project. But the company said the procurement process must change to give developers more flexibility in dealing with the roadblocks thrown up by a presidential administration opposed to offshore wind.

Without this change, offshore wind will not succeed.”

The proposed bill would repeal numerous clean energy tax credits and programs that directly benefit Kentuckians. These tax credits are helping individuals, small businesses, farmers and corporations alike reduce their energy bills, increase energy independence, and build new energy resources in Kentucky. 
The harm this would cause would be widespread and felt by people across the commonwealth, through increased energy costs, business closures, layoffs, lost economic development, and reduced access to low-cost renewable energy. Among its many harmful provisions, the House version of the bill would:

Terminate residential tax credits for solar, batteries and energy efficiency measures at the end of 2025.
Rapidly phase out commercial solar tax credits, ending the credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after passage of the bill. 
End tax credits for new and used electric vehicles at the end of 2025.

These tax credits are presently planned to last until at least 2032, to provide the long-term stability and predictability needed to support private investment in hiring, infrastructure, and manufacturing. Abruptly ending these tax incentives will sabotage the growth of these industries and the promise they offer to Kentucky and the nation.
Solar, wind, and battery storage are now essential contributors to the nation’s electric grid and economy. In 2024, solar accounted for 61% of all new electric generation capacity built in the U.S. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there were 365,000 people employed in the solar industry in 2023. Solar is now the lowest-cost source of electricity and batteries are used at-scale to maintain grid reliability and reduce costs at times of peak demand. Nationwide, solar supplied 7% of all electricity produced in 2024, a remarkable fact considering it accounted for less than 0.1% in 2010. Solar and wind now account for nearly 25% of the nation’s electricity supply. 
Recent years have seen major growth in Kentucky’s clean energy sector, with billions of dollars of investment in new battery factories and utility-scale and rooftop solar, creating thousands of jobs in communities across Kentucky. Despite its relatively small population, Kentucky has seen some of the greatest investments in clean energy infrastructure in the country. These investments are helping support grid reliability and reduce costs for consumers.
Among these developments are factories for manufacturing batteries and their components for the EV and utility industries in Bowling Green, Shelbyville, Hardin County and Hopkinsville; utility-scale solar facilities being developed on reclaimed mine lands in Martin and Pike County; and thousands of individual homes and businesses installing solar to reduce their utility costs.
These developments are threatened by the budget bill passed by House Republicans and now being considered in the Senate. There is still time to remove these provisions from the reconciliation bill.

The announcement came Monday in a news release posted to the private Catholic university’s website. The university said senior leadership assessed its financial situation and its long-term sustainability and concluded continuing beyond the academic year was not feasible.
“For 105 Years, Siena Heights University has been a beacon of light in a world sometimes cast in darkness,” said Siena Heights University President Douglas Palmer in a statement. “The spirit of Siena Heights will continue long after the institution itself closes its doors because it lives in every graduate, faculty member, and staff person who has been on campus – whether in-person or online.”

Current student academic progress and creating transfer pathways with partner institutions with as little disruption as possible will be the priority for the university as it works to close its doors.
The university was founded in 1919 by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, which along with the university’s board of trustees supported the move to close the school named after Saint Catherine of Siena.
“We are deeply grateful to the faculty, staff, students, and alumni who have worked hard decade after decade to make Siena Heights an incredibly special place,” Palmer said. “We look ahead to the next academic year planning all the activities one would normally get including athletics, residential life, and great events that we share with our alumni and entire community.”

Plaintiffs argued the statute would indirectly ban abortion medications by threatening providers with disciplinary action for off-label prescription use.
The post Judge blocks abortion restrictions in Wyoming’s new off-label medication law appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming judge on Monday blocked the state from enforcing abortion restrictions included in a new law that protects doctors who prescribe off-label medications.
In his nine-page ruling, District Judge Thomas T.C. Campbell sided with a group of abortion rights advocates who argued the law, which is set to go into effect Tuesday, would indirectly ban common abortion medications by threatening doctors and pharmacists with disciplinary action for prescribing the drugs for off-label use. The plaintiffs asked Campbell to halt enforcement while their broader lawsuit against abortion restrictions in Wyoming plays out.
Campbell rejected arguments from state attorneys defending the law as simply attempting to align the statute with two abortion bans that lawmakers passed in 2023. A different judge struck down both of those bans last year, and the Wyoming Supreme Court is now weighing an appeal on that case.

State attorneys further argued the new statute merely made clear that off-label prescriptions for non-abortion drugs would be protected under Wyoming law. Campbell, however, was unconvinced.
“To argue that the statute does not prohibit the off-label prescription of abortion-inducing drugs but merely permits off-label use for other indications, is a strained and untenable reading,” he wrote. “If the statute excludes abortion-related prescriptions from the safe harbor it creates, then it necessarily treats those prescriptions as not lawful under this provision.
“Suggesting that this exclusion simply ‘does not make it illegal’ but instead merely withholds new authorization is semantic hair-splitting; in practical terms, the statute draws a bright line between permissible off-label uses and those it aims to restrict, abortion among them,” Campbell continued. “For these reasons, the court cannot accept the State Defendants’ claim that the Wyoming Off-Label Protection Laws do not attempt to limit access to abortion medication when that is precisely what it does.”
The most common regimen of abortion medications includes the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. Typically, a patient takes mifepristone first, then misoprostol later.
Health care amendment
Campbell’s ruling is the latest in a string of court victories for abortion access advocates in Wyoming. The same group of plaintiffs — including Casper’s Wellspring Health Access, the state’s lone abortion clinic — successfully challenged the 2023 abortion bans and convinced Campbell earlier this year to temporarily block additional restrictions, including a mandatory ultrasound and 48-hour waiting period.
All of those challenges have pointed to a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution, which protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment allows legislators to enact certain restrictions, but the government must demonstrate a compelling public interest in doing so.

The government, Campbell wrote, did not identify such an interest, nor could the court independently find one.
“Thus, because provisions of the Wyoming Off-Label Protection Laws interfere with one’s fundamental right to make healthcare decisions, and the laws achieve no apparent compelling government interest, at this stage in the proceedings, the court finds that there is a likelihood of success that Plaintiffs prevail on their challenge to the constitutionality of the
statute, both facially and as applied,” he wrote.
Common prescription practice
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration approves medications for certain uses and in certain doses. But doctors commonly prescribe medications for off-label purposes — in other words, uses not approved by the FDA. For example, doctors sometimes prescribe propranolol for anxiety even though it’s been approved as a blood pressure medication. A medication in a different dose than what the FDA approved would also qualify as off-label use.
Interest in protecting the practice of off-label prescriptions grew in the wake of the COVID pandemic, when some providers faced possible disciplinary action for prescribing hydroxychloroquine, an FDA-approved malaria drug, to treat the virus. Then Rep. Sarah Penn, R-Lander, drafted a bill protecting off-label prescriptions in 2023, but it failed to advance. 
Earlier this year, Rep. Gary Brown, R-Cheyenne, successfully brought back a similar measure. House Bill 164, “Medical prescriptions-off-label purposes,” codified the practice of prescribing off-label medications in Wyoming. But it specified those protections did not apply to schedule I or II controlled substances (such as heroin or fentanyl), gender care for children and medications intended to induce an abortion.

(Getty Images)Clean energy advocates are warning that the most recent version of the congressional special bill that proposes to cut credits and implement significant restrictions to clean energy projects could raise prices for Mainers, threaten new industry jobs and thwart the state’s climate goals.
“By every measure this bill is a disaster for the hard-working people of Maine, and it will be especially devastating for the clean air and water that is central to our way of life,” said Anya Fetcher, federal policy advocate for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. 
For those reasons and larger climate concerns driving the state’s transition away from fossil fuels, Fetcher along with industry heads are asking U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to “stand up for Maine” and vote against the bill. 
The U.S. Senate released its 940-page version of the spending bill just after midnight on Friday. In a last minute change to the Senate proposal, Republican leadership added language to phase out clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act by 2027.
The bill would also impose a steep penalty on all new wind and solar farms that come online after that date, unless they follow new tightened restrictions on imported components, namely from China.  
Collins voted along with the majority of her party over the weekend to begin the marathon debate and amendment process, which is expected to last until Tuesday.
While she supports the tax relief portion of the spending bill, Collins said in a statement Monday afternoon that she opposes other elements, including the new excise tax and other “burdensome provisions on energy projects.”
“We have many more amendments to go through and debate to be had before we vote on final passage,” Collins added. 
In the most recent iteration, senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally, credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.
Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.
In addition to concerns that the bill could worsen already increasing energy costs, Nicholas Janzen, policy and partnerships director for Maine Conservation Voters, said that eliminating the clean energy tax credits could threaten the more than 15,000 clean energy jobs in the state.  
“Senator Collins must decide today if she will stand with her constituents who overwhelmingly oppose increased energy bills and losing clean energy jobs,” he said. 
Maine’s budding offshore wind industry has already faced setbacks under President Donald Trump but the credit rollback could further derail plans, despite offshore wind being a key component of Maine’s goal of reaching 100% clean energy by 2040.
Dan Clapp, chief executive officer of regional solar company ReVision Energy, said Mainers could also face higher power bills if the proposal were to pass in its current form. The bill would undercut solar, wind and energy storage efforts and in turn drive up project costs, which would ultimately cause greater reliance on fossil fuels with volatile prices, he said. 
Clapp also asked Collins to back an amendment introduced by other senators to remove the new excise tax on the industry.
“Maine can’t afford this bill,” he said. 
This comes after members of Maine’s solar and energy storage industry asked Collins in early June to protect the clean energy tax credits that were proposed to be scaled back in the U.S. House of Representatives version of the spending bill. 
The nearly 70 industry representatives cited three credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act that specifically support solar panel manufacturing and deployment that they asked the senator to protect.

Joseph Cervantes.","A sign marking a cannabis dispensary in Santa Fe county. The state's Regulation and Licensing Department will soon hire a police chief tasked with leading a new crew of certified police officers to enforce criminal violations of the state's cannabis laws. Lawmakers also are pushing for action addressing the high number of licenses in the state. (Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source New Mexico)More than three years after New Mexico legalized recreational marijuana, the state has become a national poster-child for recreational marijuana sales, and not in a good way, argues State Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces).
“We’ve become the mecca for ‘mota’,” Cervantes said, using a slang term for marijuana common in New Mexico. “And we have to ask ourselves: Is that really what we want to be?”
He and other state lawmakers on the Legislature’s interim Courts and Criminal Justice Committee met Monday morning in Taos to discuss the proliferation of shops across the state, as well as their hopes for a new band of cannabis officers tasked with enforcing laws the Legislature enacted when it legalized recreational marijuana in April 2022.
Since legalizing cannabis, New Mexico retailers have sold about $1.7 billion combined in adult-use and medical cannabis, with the help of more than 1,600 licensed cannabis-related businesses such as retailers, testing labs and producers, according to a presentation from state Regulation and Licensing Department officials who spoke at the committee meeting. 
New Mexico House to consider strengthening cannabis regulation

While the industry is booming, high-profile examples of marijuana scofflaws in the state prompted lawmakers this session to pass House Bill 10, which funds the hiring and training of a new team of fully certified law enforcement officers empowered to bring criminal charges against those they suspect are lying about the source of the marijuana, exploiting their workers or altering the drug.
In the coming days, the state will advertise for a police chief in charge of the new crew of officers, according to Clay Bailey, superintendent of the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Division. From there, they’ll hire up to six more officers. 
“I really want seasoned people that know what they’re doing, [who have] dealt with drugs and things, and know what they’re getting into,” Bailey said of the new hires. 
HB10 also empowers the new officers to do more forensic accounting within the state’s system for tracking growers from seed to sale. The new hires free up inspectors to undertake audits to determine, for example, whether growers are lying about where their inventory came from or if they’re flooding the market with illegal products, Bailey said.
40 dispensaries and one grocery store
No limits exist in state law on the number of licenses that can be issued, and local jurisdictions also cannot ban cannabis dispensaries from operating, according to the Regulation and Licensing Division, though they can control how far apart they must be. Maestas suggested lawmakers change state law to grant control over licenses to towns and cities. 
In Sunland Park, which borders Texas where recreational marijuana is illegal, up to 40 cannabis retailers exist, state officials said Monday. 
“This is just not healthy,” said Cervantes, whose senate district includes Sunland Park. “This is not a healthy environment for my community, for Sunland Park to have 36 [to] 40 dispensaries, one grocery store, maybe one liquor store.”
According to state data presented Monday, the town of less than 20,000 people has generated the second-highest amount of marijuana revenue in the state since April 2022. Regulators have tallied more than $127 million in recreational sales revenue from nearly 3 million transactions. Albuquerque, the highest-earning city, has generated more than $350 million.
According to a 2024 Pew Research Center study, Oklahoma has the highest number of marijuana dispensaries per capita in the country, with 36 per 100,000 residents. Cervantes estimated New Mexico to be about 30 per 100,000, which puts it far ahead of early marijuana adopters California and Colorado. 
A coalition of about 100 cannabis businesses in June 2023 asked the governor to issue a pause on new licenses, saying they faced too much competition and chaos from a “flourishing” black market. 
The issue has not gone away. Several lawmakers said they want to see the issue addressed in next year’s 30-day legislative session. Though budget-focused, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham could deem the topic germane. 
“I hope you’ll ask the governor to fix what needs to be fixed,” Cervantes told the state cannabis regulators at the meeting, “and have us do that in the remaining administration in the 30-day session coming up.
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday afternoon. However, in a town hall meeting in July in Española, the governor did acknowledge that the state needed to fix its process for licensing, in response to a resident’s complaint about the number of dispensaries. 
“Expect the state to propose some restrictions,” the governor said, drawing applause, saying that the licensing “didn’t roll out the way we intended for it to roll out.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-5612-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)This story was originally posted on IdahoEdNews.org on June 30, 2025.
The “Everyone is Welcome Here” sign that sparked a viral nationwide controversy can no longer be displayed in Idaho schools, according to an Idaho attorney general’s office opinion released late Friday.
The revelation became public a day after Idaho EdNews received a redacted version of the opinion, which the Idaho Department of Education used to write its guidance on the flags-in-schools law.

House Bill 41, which goes into effect Tuesday, prohibits flags or banners depicting a political viewpoint from public K-12 schools. The law’s vague language led to questions from educators and school leaders.
The Department of Education asked the attorney general’s office on March 28 for guidance on the new law. It took the attorney general’s office until May 29 to provide a response. The department then took nearly another month to provide guidance to school districts, which it did Thursday.
That guidance said school employees cannot display flags or banners that show opinions, emotions, beliefs or thoughts about politics, economics, society, faith or religion. The guidance and the attorney general’s opinion did not define these terms.
Idaho Department of Education asked AG for guidance on ‘Everyone is welcome here sign’
The attorney general’s opinion released to EdNews Thursday had one section redacted, pertaining to signs West Ada School District teacher Sarah Inama had displayed in her classroom for years. One sign read “Everyone is Welcome Here.”
West Ada administrators said the signs — including one displaying open hands of different skin tones — violated district policy. Inama refused to remove the sign, and in March, her story attracted national media coverage.
The Idaho Department of Education asked the attorney general’s office if Inama’s signs in particular violated the new law.
The attorney general’s office said yes.
“These signs are part of an ideological/social movement which started in Twin Cities, Minnesota following the 2016 election of Donald Trump,” the attorney general’s response reads. “Since that time, the signs have been used by the Democratic party as a political statement. The Idaho Democratic Party even sells these signs as part of its fundraising efforts.”
The opinion then links to a news story from a Minnesota news station back in 2017 when a group of women came together against hate after racist graffiti appeared at Maple Grove High School the day after Trump’s 2016 election. Their signs read “All are Welcome Here.” The founders of the movement told the TV station that their movement was about combating hate and was nonpartisan and secular.
The signs were popular at Minnesota schools, according to the story.
The Idaho Democratic Party did not begin selling the signs until March 25, after Inama’s story went viral, communications director Avery Roberts said. Roberts said the signs and stickers are sold nearly at cost and aren’t a tool to make money but instead to show support for Inama and inclusivity.
“Across the state, parents and teachers, regardless of their political affiliations, want children to have a fair shot. They’re working hard to build strong public schools where every student feels welcome and has the support they need to succeed,” Roberts wrote in an email to EdNews. “What matters is the message. Taking a stand against discrimination shouldn’t be a partisan issue, and we hope leaders in every party see it that way.”
The opinion went on to note that Inama began displaying the signs in 2017, shortly after Trump’s first election, and that Inama said she hung the sign to “share her personal, ideological beliefs.”
Inama did not respond to request for comment.
In a March interview, Inama told EdNews that she found the West Ada’s request to remove the signs “disturbing,” and said it seemed like district officials were trying to avoid potential complaints from people with “exclusionary” beliefs.
“That’s appeasing, not a political view, but a bigoted view that shouldn’t even be considered by a public school district,” Inama said.
Where she first went public with the story, she said administrators told her the signs were not “content neutral,” and were “a personal opinion,” she told KTVB. “I was told … that ‘everyone is welcome here’ is not something that everybody believes.”
Inama disagreed. “I feel like this is the basis of public education.”
Following Inama’s KTVB interview, dozens of Boise School District leaders and teachers sported “Everyone is Welcome Here” T-shirts in a social media post. Boise hired Inama to teach there next school year. Inama told EdNews earlier this month she planned to put up her inclusive signs in her new Boise classroom.
The Department of Education decided to release the unredacted attorney general’s opinion at 5:30 p.m. Friday. The department did not explain the timing, and has yet to respond to a request for comment.

In broad terms, these policies will focus on reshaping the state’s K-12 education system, addressing financial challenges facing Mississippi’s pension system for state workers, expanding voting rights and addressing infrastructure challenges facing the capital city of Jackson. 
Days after White announced the formation of three new select committees to study key policy areas ahead of the 2026 session, White spoke Monday to the Mississippi State University Stennis Institute of Government and Capitol Press Corps.
White offered more specifics on the legislative strategy he plans to push next year after a 2025 legislative session shaped by Republican infighting, historic tax reforms and uncertainty at the federal level.
House will propose ‘school choice/education freedom’ package
The House will propose one sprawling education reform package containing many of the “school choice” provisions that died last session, White said. 
This is a departure from the piecemeal strategy House Republicans undertook last session, where the chamber passed a series of standalone education bills. Many of the House’s bills either died in the Senate or, in the case of a proposal that would have allowed some Mississippi parents to use taxpayer money to pay for private schools, didn’t come up for a vote on the House floor. 
The new approach is modeled after the sweeping tax reform package that the Legislature passed last session and the “Big Beautiful Bill” moving through the Republican-controlled Congress.
“I think it’s why you see even in our national Congress now considering that one huge bill because in the volatile political world that we live in, there are things in there that folks for whatever reason, because of a certain voter base or political ideology, they say they can’t go there, but there are enough good things (in the bill) that they’re able to get there,” White said. 
The congressional measure, which was being debated Monday in the United States Senate, could itself alter public education funding in states around the country.
Next session, White said the House will introduce a “comprehensive” package containing all of its key priorities, which include lifting restrictions on public school transfers, closing and consolidating some schools, and allowing Mississippi children being home-schooled to play public school sports. 
White also said he wants to focus on social factors, such as poverty, that may hinder academic performance. 
“It’s going to be comprehensive, it’ll be bold and it’ll be uncomfortable,” White said. “It’ll be uncomfortable for me, it’ll be uncomfortable for people in my own caucus, and for people on the other side of the aisle. But it can absolutely alter the (education) landscape.”
White said he is a proponent of “universal school choice,” which often refers to policies that allow all households — regardless of income level — to use public education dollars to send their children to private schools or other institutions of their choice, rather than being assigned to public schools based on where they live. 
But White acknowledged on Monday that there haven’t been enough votes in his chamber to advance such a measure, a political reality he traced back to the racial politics of education in Mississippi. Following the Civil Rights reforms of the 1960s, many private schools in Mississippi opened as bulwarks against racial integration.
White, who favors the term “education freedom” instead of the “school choice” moniker embraced by most conservative education groups, said the new Education Freedom Select Committee will examine education policies passed by many other Republican-controlled legislatures nationwide.
Finding a “dedicated revenue stream” for PERS 
White said the House will try again to pass legislation with a “dedicated revenue stream” for the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS, which currently faces an over $25 billion unfunded liability.
White said his House Republican Caucus still favors either diverting most of the state’s lottery proceeds to PERS or legalizing mobile sports betting and using the revenue to help make the pension system solvent. These proposals will be the subject of another House select committee.
The Senate has favored a “hybrid” retirement plan to shore up the system financially by cutting benefits for future employees. 
Voter Rights
The House will again aim to implement early voting in Mississippi, which is one of only three states without no-excuse early voting or no-excuse absentee voting.
Senate leaders, on the last day of their regular 2025 session, decided not to send a bill to Gov. Tate Reeves that would have expanded pre-Election Day voting options. The governor has been vocally opposed to early voting in Mississippi and would likely have vetoed the measure.
A House Voters’ Rights Select Committee will examine paths forward for restoring suffrage for individuals convicted of crimes who have completed their sentences. The committee will also explore re-establishing a ballot initiative process, an effort that has failed for several years in a row after the previous initiative process was struck down by the state Supreme Court.
In the Senate, such a measure would have to go through the Accountability, Efficiency, Transparency committee, where last session it died under the leadership of Republican chairman Sen. David Parker.
Parker is not running for reelection, a development that bodes well for restoring the ballot initiative process, White said Monday, without naming Parker. 
Jackson-related bills and local projects
The Capital and Metro Revitalization Select Committee, established in 2024, will continue to focus on local governance issues in the capital city of Jackson after helping pass five bills into law last session.
In 2026, White said, the House will focus on addressing infrastructure woes plaguing Jackson’s water and sewer systems. White said the state would not aim to “take over” the systems, a concern often voiced by Democrats, almost all of whom are Black, about the majority-white, Republican-controlled Legislature usurping local rule in Jackson. 
Last session, a source of Republican infighting between the House and Senate concerned whether to pass a “Christmas Tree” bill, or a bill that appropriates hundreds of millions of dollars in local projects around the state. To the House’s chagrin, that never happened, and White said he remains “disappointed” in the Senate leadership over the disagreement. 
“We should have funded local projects, and we didn’t because of politics and nothing else,” White said. 
White said he heard the Senate might introduce a local projects bill in January next session, earlier than normal, but he remains concerned the chambers are far from reaching an agreement.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10091707/Legislative-Session-2025-1.jpg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

Daugaard endorsed U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who is seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Johnson’s possible opponents for the nomination include current Gov. Larry Rhoden, whose lieutenant governor is Tony Venhuizen. Daugaard is Venhuizen’s father-in-law.
Rhoden was the lieutenant governor for Kristi Noem, and he’s serving the remainder of her term after she left in January to lead the federal Department of Homeland Security. Rhoden picked Venhuizen, who was a state legislator, as his lieutenant governor.

Rhoden has not yet announced whether he will run for his own term as governor next year, or whether Venhuizen would be his running mate. Venhuizen declined to comment Monday when contacted by South Dakota Searchlight.
Following Daugaard’s attendance at Johnson’s campaign event Monday in Sioux Falls, Daugaard told South Dakota Searchlight that his endorsement honors a promise he made previously to Johnson.
“I think when you say you are going to do something, you should do it,” Daugaard said, adding he doesn’t know what Rhoden is going to do. Daugaard described Rhoden as a friend and an honorable public servant.
Johnson and Venhuizen each served stints as Daugaard’s chief of staff — Johnson from 2011 to 2014, and Venhuizen from 2014 to 2019.
At Johnson’s Monday campaign event, Daugaard described Johnson as a bridge-builder and problem-solver.
“As my chief of staff, Dusty helped me cut $127 million from our state budget to get it back to balance,” Daugaard said, “without raising taxes and without cutting vital services, either, but by doing what great leaders do: getting people together, and finding consensus about ways the work can be done. And listening to different perspectives — always putting South Dakota first.”
Daugaard has also frequently praised his son-in-law, including when Venhuizen was chosen as lieutenant governor in January. At the time, Daugaard said he was “very proud” of Venhuizen.
“He will be a great help to Governor Rhoden,” Daugaard said then. “I know they’ll be complimentary to each other, and I couldn’t be happier for Tony.”

Lonnie Everill, 46, of Water Valley, whose work focused on supervising and rehabilitating sexual offenders, was sentenced in federal court, months after receiving over 1,400 images sent and received over a four-month period.
An FBI investigation began after Everill sent chats with an undercover agent about arranging to travel to California and have sex with a child Everill believed was the agent’s niece, according to court records. 
They began to exchange chats after Everill joined a public group on the platform KIK that the agent was in – a group with about 100 members who were exchanging child sexual abuse material and talking about children. 
Investigators found images and videos of young children and toddlers not being sexually abused on Everill’s accounts. The material also included selfies of Everill and pictures of local minors not engaged in sexually explicit conduct. 
Joyner and Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI Jackson Field Office, called the crime a betrayal of trust for the victims, community and credibility of federal probation officers in the district. 
Everill had worked in several states including Mississippi, according to Joyner’s office. 
“No matter their badge or title, the FBI will always aggressively pursue those that prey on our children,” Eikhoff said in a statement. 
U.S. District Judge Dan Jordan sentenced Everill to 10 years in the Bureau of Prisons followed by 10 years of supervised release. Everill will be required to register as a sex offender, and the judge also ordered requirements meant to restrict Everill’s access to children and the internet. 
The judge also ordered him to pay $3,000 in restitution to the victims in the images he had, and an additional $10,000 assessment.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/07092505/c6428-gavel-court.jpg,,,2025-06-30 18:06:11.799778

(Courtesy NPS)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials established a new Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) Management Zone comprising Hunting District 170 in the Flathead Valley.
Announced last week, the new zone increases hunting opportunities in a management area centered on the Flathead County landfill north of Kalispell. It follows the detection of CWD in white-tailed deer for the first time in the hunting district in October of last year.
In early October 2024, FWP officials received reports of a symptomatic buck near the Flathead County landfill and euthanized the animal. Initial and followup CWD testing returned a positive result.
The disease always results in death for infected animals and there is no known cure.
“By implementing this CWD Management Zone and increasing harvest opportunities, we aim to reduce local deer density and curb the potential spread of this disease,” Franz Ingelfinger, an FWP wildlife biologist, said in a press release. “Hunting is the primary tool for monitoring and managing the spread of CWD, and we appreciate hunters helping us take an aggressive, localized approach to this.”

Chronic Wasting Disease affects members of the deer family, including elk, moose, mule deer, and white-tailed deer and is caused by a malformed prion protein. Symptomatic animals can exhibit neurological and behavioral changes and emaciation.
Within the new management zone, which has a roughly five-mile radius around the landfill, hunters can purchase an over-the-counter B license for white-tailed deer. Hunters are limited to one license, valid through archery, general, heritage muzzleloader and late season, with no overall quote on the new license.
FWP is also increasing the number of 170-00 antlerless white-tailed B licenses available per hunter from one to two, valid throughout Hunting District 170.
In a press release, FWP officials said they aim to assess the prevalence and extent of CWD in the area while reducing local deer density to slow the disease’s spread and prevalence in the area. All hunters are encouraged to get harvested animals sampled for CWD.
The detection of CWD at the landfill underscores the urgency of localized management, according to the press release. The management zone is strategically designed to focus harvest around the point of detection while minimizing impact on migratory deer populations wintering west of the Stillwater River, a natural geographic barrier or deer wintering on the Ray Kuhns Wildlife Management Area, which closes Dec. 1.
During the 2024-2025 hunting season, FWP submitted a record 9,066 samples for CWD testing. Of those samples, 335 tested positive for CWD — 202 white-tailed deer, 127 mule deer and six elk.

Mike DeWine is expected to issue vetoes on the state’s operating budget on Monday night. The most likely to be axed: provisions dealing with children, health care and home rule.
With the flick of a pen, DeWine can preserve the GOP budget — or kill whichever provision he wants.
All eyes in the Ohio Statehouse are on the governor’s desk.
“Unfortunately, there’s no shortage of provisions that are gonna do real damage to the people of Ohio,” state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, said.


The governor’s priorities as the leader of Ohio have always been clear: children.


Here’s where he may use his veto pen


In evaluating how DeWine works, his previous vetoes, and his statements over the past several months, some clues emerge.


“He’s disappointed by things that are in the budget,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.
This list is non-exhaustive.
State lawmakers voted to restrict access to Medicaid for babies ages 0-3.
They capped funding for lead poisoning prevention each year.
They also eliminated the advisory council on how to handle rare diseases.
Other provisions cut mental health assistance, something the governor has championed.
“Continue our efforts in regard to mental health, this is something that is so vitally important for Ohio to move forward,” the governor said in mid-June.
The lawmakers also put restrictions on what H2Ohio, DeWine’s clean water program, can do.
“Clean water in the state of Ohio is essential to us,” he said, previously saying that the House’s cuts to the program worried him.
DeWine has always emphasized the importance of libraries and reading for children. One provision in the budget DeWine may veto requires public libraries to place books referencing “sexual orientation or gender” in an area away from the public. This means that even books that reference a female character in the title could be blocked, according to a Northeast Ohio librarian.
“These libraries are free. They’re the center of the community many times. They’re places where you can go and your kids can go,” DeWine told reporters on Saturday. “I’ll have more to say about it.”
There are also provisions that stop funding for both youth homeless shelters and mental health services that support transgender or nonbinary identities. The governor has previously vetoed legislation that would ban gender-affirming care for LGBTQ+ youth, but the legislature passed an override. He has spoken at length about how this care was essential for these children’s mental health.
Another veto possibility is a provision taking away some of the school districts’ savings, capping the carryover revenue at 40% and requiring anything above that mark be refunded to taxpayers.
“This is a state that, by and large, gives due respect to the local communities in regard to running the schools,” he said on Saturday.
Other restrictions include the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. In the budget, there are many smaller items impacting how schools manage their money that could all be up for veto.
“As far as the financing and other things, we leave a lot of that to the local community,” the governor said.
Legislation that the governor has not supported includes state funding for the new Cleveland Browns stadium — although he likes the most current version using unclaimed funds better than using bonds — and the proposed 2.75% flat income tax.
“Not one time did a company say I can’t come to Ohio because your income tax is too high,” the governor said in May, adding that a full repeal of an income tax or a flat tax could cause detriments to social services. “We’d have to look at what the consequences are and what impact that might have on our ability to fund education and do other things.”
DeWine’s vetoes will come out Monday before midnight. He is set to have a press conference to explain his decisions on Tuesday.

(Photo by Andrew Kennard for Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa drivers will be more likely to get pulled over after July 1 if they are behind the wheel with their cellphones in their hands. This new law is one of many passed by the Iowa Legislature during the 2025 session set to go into effect at the beginning of July.
Senate File 22 bans the use of cellphones and electronic devices when not in voice activated or hands-free mode while operating a vehicle. Police officers will begin pulling over distracted drivers and charging them with a warning starting July 1. Come January 2026, offenders will be charged with a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine between $100 and $850.
Here are 10 more laws that create additional criminal penalties or expand the definition of previous crimes that go into effect July 1:
Driving with an open-container THC beverage
House File 181 prohibits open-container beverages containing THC in the passenger area of motor vehicles. People are allowed to transport open-beverage THC drinks in the trunk of their vehicles but if it’s anywhere else in the car, and they risk being charged with a simple misdemeanor punishable by a $260 fine.

Gift card fraud
Senate File 260 creates a graduated penalty for altering or tampering with a gift card with intent to defraud. Under the new law, a violator commits forgery and is guilty of different charges based on the fraudulent amount or value of goods purchased with a fraudulent card. The crime is a class C felony if more than $5,000 is uploaded to a card or obtained in stolen goods; a class D felony if the fraudulent value is between $5,000 and $1,000; an aggravated misdemeanor if the fraudulent value is between $1,000 and $500, and a serious misdemeanor if the fraudulent value is under $500.
Additionally, the value of retail merchandise fraudulently obtained within a six-month period will be aggregated and the defendant will be charged for the total amount. 
Critical infrastructure sabotage
House File 879 expands the definition of “critical infrastructure sabotage” to include a telecommunications service, information service or cable service, a wireless service or broadband generation, transmission or delivery service. Individuals found guilty of willfully impairing critical infrastructure are guilty of a class B felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison and a fine between $85,000 and $100,000.
Grooming
House File 180 defines grooming as an attempt to persuade a minor to commit an unlawful sexual act, punishable as a class D felony. Individuals found guilty will be classified as tier 1 sex offenders. Those convicted are subject to 10 years in prison, with possibility of parole. This law explicitly includes law enforcement sting operations within the statute, meaning even if the intended victim is an undercover police officer, individuals can be prosecuted for grooming.
Distribution of obscene material to a minor
Under House File 306, people age 18 or older who knowingly share or exhibit obscene material to a minor, other than the parents or guardian of the minor, are guilty of a public offense. 
Upon first offense, violators will be charged with a serious misdemeanor and subject to up to one year in jail and/or $430-2,560 in fines. A second offense is an aggravated misdemeanor and subject to a minimum mandatory confinement of one year which will not be deferred or suspended. Following a third offense, individuals are charged with a class D felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of three years.
Minor-to-minor distribution of obscene material is also considered a public offense and individuals under 18 found guilty will be charged with a serious misdemeanor.
Assault on a health care provider 
House File 310 expands the definition of health care providers to protect against assault. Anyone working, volunteering or participating in an educational course at a hospital or rural emergency hospital or nursing home is now protected under this law. 
Persons found guilty of assaulting a health care provider under the new definition can be charged based on the severity of the assault ranging from serious misdemeanor to a class “C” felony based on the severity.
Human trafficking
House File 649 expands the definition of human trafficking. Someone who attempts to purchase services like commercial sexual activity from a law enforcement professional posing as a trafficker commits a class “D” felony. 
The bill also expanded the definition of “services” to no longer require an “ongoing relationship” between the person who requests unlawful services and the victim. The new definition is performing activities under the supervision of or for the benefit of another, including commercial sexual activity and sexually explicit performances.
The new definition of “victim” now includes all of the following: a person subjected to human trafficking, a person identified as being subjected or targeted for human trafficking and a law enforcement official impersonating a human trafficking victim. A class D felony is punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a fine ranging between $750 and $7,500.
Possession of visual depictions of minor engaged in unlawful sex act
Senate File 150 ensures persons in possession of visual depictions containing pictorial representations of a minor engaging in a prohibited sexual act, including altered or edited pictures, of different minors will be punished with separate offenses for each “pictorial representation.” Multiple depictions of the same minor engaging in a prohibited sexual act will now be prosecuted as separate offenses for each representation. A person guilty of this offense will be charged with a class “D” felony for a first offense, and a class C felony for subsequent offenses.
Assault on law enforcement professional
Senate File 397 expands penalties for assault on persons engaged in certain professions. Under this bill, assault against a peace officer, jailer, correctional or juvenile detention staff, or employee of the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing who conducts investigations or inspections, is punishable up to a class C felony. All individuals found guilty of assault on these protected professions must serve a minimum term of seven days. 
Additionally, the definition of assault has been expanded to include contact with saliva through tossing, spitting or throwing. 
Firearm possession by felons
Senate File 462 significantly increases penalties for firearm possession by felons for repeat offenders. First-time offenders face a class D felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of two years; second-time offenders would face a class D felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of four years; third-time offenders would face a class C felony with a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence and fourth or subsequent offenses would face a 10-year sentence recommendation. The bill prevents courts from deferring or suspending sentences, except for first-time offenders with a county attorney recommendation.

(Photo via Google Earth)An Iowa judge has paused a malpractice case against a cosmetic surgeon who recently surrendered her license after being charged with professional incompetence.
In May 2025, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Lindsay Sturm of Sturm Cosmetic Surgery in Ames with professional incompetence, which includes failure by a physician to exercise a degree of care ordinarily exercised by the average physician.
The board alleged Sturm failed to meet the standard of care in patient selection by failing to recognize body dysmorphia in a patient and failing to select the appropriate operation for another patient. According to the board, Sturm was also alleged to have failed to meet the standard of care for consent by failing to obtain signed consent forms for certain procedures, and is alleged to have failed to adequately follow up with patients after surgery.

Board records indicate that Sturm, without admitting any wrongdoing, opted not to contest the charges and agreed to voluntarily surrender her license. She will be eligible to seek reinstatement of her license in two years.
The board’s action followed the initiation of three separate investigations into Sturm. Two of those board investigations originated in 2023 and one was launched in 2024.
In May 2024, the family of Angela Kettwig sued Sturm and Sturm Cosmetic Surgery in Story County District Court. According to the lawsuit, Sturm performed liposuction and an abdominoplasty on Kettwig in March 2023.
During the surgery, Sturm allegedly caused injuries to Kettwig that led to a massive hemorrhage, and Kettwig died from cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic shock. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for negligence and loss of parental consortium.
Sturm denied any wrongdoing in the case, asserting that any injuries suffered by Kettwig were “caused by pre-existing conditions or acts which these answering defendants have no control.” A trial was scheduled for Feb. 10, 2026. However, on June 14, 2025, Sturm filed for bankruptcy. As a result, the Kettwig family’s malpractice lawsuit has been stayed by a Polk County judge while the bankruptcy case moves forward.
According to the bankruptcy court filings, Sturm’s gross personal income in 2023 was $269,000. She and her husband have claimed $5.9 million in assets and $5.3 million in liabilities.
Two malpractice lawsuits pending
Sturm is also being sued by another former patient, Joseph Kaissi, who claims he went to Sturm Cosmetic Surgery on Jan. 25, 2022, for a consultation and was immediately recommended for a surgical procedure to correct the separation of abdominal muscles. Two days later, Sturm performed the operation at Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames.
The lawsuit claims the procedure was a “risky and unnecessary” operation, that Sturm failed to treat Kaissi’s hematoma and failed to exercise the appropriate degree of acceptable surgical technique. Kaissi alleges he sustained “serious and permanent injuries” as a result of the operation.
Sturm has denied any wrongdoing and asserted any injuries were caused by preexisting conditions or acts over which Sturm had no control. A jury trial is scheduled for Sept. 9, 2025.
Kaissi’s attorneys have asked that their case not be stayed by Sturm’s bankruptcy filing. They argue that Sturm’s liability is covered by an insurance policy with limits of up to $1 million per claim and an annual aggregate cap of $3 million. They are asking to proceed with their case with the understanding that any recovery will be limited to what the insurance company pays, ensuring none of Sturm’s debtors will be harmed by the payout.
Former employee suing Sturm
Sturm Cosmetic Surgery is also facing a lawsuit filed by a former employee and registered nurse, Tonya Becker. In her lawsuit, Becker claims she was responsible for assisting Sturm with cosmetic surgeries and overseeing patients’ post-anesthesia care at the Ames clinic.
The lawsuit alleges Sturm fired Becker in 2024, a year after hiring her, and that the dismissal was due to Becker “refusing to compromise patient safety, rejecting illegal and unethical directives, and standing up against a toxic work environment.”
Becker claims that while working at the clinic, she “discovered numerous unethical and inappropriate practices that jeopardized patient safety,” in part by falsely informing a patient she had performed treatments on both hips when, in fact, only the right hip was treated.
The lawsuit also alleges Sturm allowed scrub technicians to assist in closing patient incisions, despite the fact that they were not licensed to perform such tasks, and that discarding expired medication was against the clinic’s policy as it was considered wasteful.
In early 2024, the lawsuit claims, the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services performed a nonpunitive site visit, as requested by the clinic, to examine infection control procedures. The lawsuit alleges DHHS identified several deficiencies that were then “brushed off” by clinic management as unimportant.
In an April 2024 staff meeting, Sturm allegedly cried and stated that she had to personally cover the $17,000 cost of discarding expired medications and blamed the staff for being wasteful by discarding the drugs.
In addition to claiming wrongful termination and age discrimination, Becker is also suing Sturm for sexual harassment, alleging that in 2023 Sturm instructed a colleague to purchase a “rainbow-tail dildo.” Sturm gave the device to a nurse during a staff meeting and workers later made lewd jokes about it, even while patients were under anesthesia for surgical procedures, the lawsuit claims.
In a January 2024 surgical meeting with Sturm, the lawsuit alleges, a scrub tech showed the entire team a Reddit video of a male doctor masturbating. “The group laughed and commented on the size of (the doctor’s) penis,” the lawsuit claims.
On other occasions, a scrub tech allegedly exposed her breasts during a surgical meeting after a colleague commented on her bra and, in a hallway, lifted her skirt and exposed herself while colleagues danced and chanted.
Sturm and the clinic have denied any wrongdoing. A jury trial is scheduled Sept. 29, 2026. Although the case was initially stayed due to Sturm’s bankruptcy filing, the case is now proceeding with only the clinic named as a defendant.

CHICAGO — Illinois students won’t need to fill out applications for most state universities to be admitted — if they have high enough grades.

With his signature, Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday approved a bill creating the direct admissions program. Along with it, he approved bills that implement new state standards for programs offering college credits to high school students, and new requirements for financial aid application assistance.

“These bills streamline the application process for college-bound seniors in Illinois, enhance support for applicants, and open up new horizons for prospective students,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Enacting these laws is what all government work should be about — making life easier for our people.”

Pritzker had said college admissions and higher education accessibility would be a priority of his during this year’s legislative season, which ended May 31. But one of his signature initiatives — allowing community colleges to offer four-year degrees — failed earlier this year.

Direct college admissions

Illinois will implement a direct admissions program so that students hoping to go to a state school will be automatically admitted — if they have a high enough grade point average.

“For eligible seniors and community college transfer students, you will receive offers from the schools that you are admitted to without raising a finger. That’s huge,” Sen. Christopher Belt, D-Swansea, said. “It takes away the anxiety, it takes away the angst of that whole process.”

The bill outlining the direct admissions program, House Bill 3522, passed unanimously in the Senate and with broad bipartisan support in the House in late May.

The program will begin in the 2027-28 school year, with nine of the state’s 11 public universities participating:


University of Illinois Springfield
Southern Illinois University
Chicago State University
Eastern Illinois University
Governors State University
Illinois State University
Northeastern Illinois University
Northern Illinois University
Western Illinois University


High school students and community college students hoping to transfer to a state school must opt-in to the program to receive offers. Community colleges already admit all students interested in attending but will still participate in the direct admissions program.

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and University of Illinois Chicago will not participate in the direct admission program. The state will, however, provide information about traditional applications to qualifying students through an “access and outreach campaign.”

The criteria for the direct admissions program and outreach campaign will be set by individual schools.

“This new, statewide direct admissions program will make a college degree more accessible for students and will motivate them to continue in their life-changing college journey by ensuring them a spot at their community college or at one of the state's public universities,” Illinois Board of Higher Education Executive Director Ginger Ostro said in a Monday statement.

Financial aid application assistance

Two more bills signed by Pritzker on Monday, House Bills 3096 and 3097, aim to make it easier for students to navigate the financial aid process.

HB 3096 requires high schools in Illinois to designate at least one staff member as a point-of-contact for information about the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. HB 3097 requires high schools to offer students time during the school day to fill out FAFSA forms and to receive assistance in doing so.

The new requirements go into effect in the 2025-26 school year.

Information collected through FAFSA is used to determine eligibility for federal loans. Many schools use FAFSA for their own aid programs, and the state offers need-based grants based on information submitted through FAFSA.

“As a father of college students, I just currently went through this fun exercise with my daughter filling out a FAFSA form,” Sen. Javier Cervantes, D-Chicago, said. “I’m being a little sarcastic calling it fun because we had deadlines, we had to make sure we had our documentation together and it wasn’t easy.”

From the 2010 to 2020 school years, an average of 86% of first-time students at four-year schools and 78% of first-time students at two-year schools received federal financial aid, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.

Dual credit program
House Bill 2967, another bill approved by Pritzker on Monday, outlines new requirements for high schools and community colleges offering “dual credit” programs, through which students earn high school and college credit for completing a single course.

It requires teachers teaching dual credit classes to have a master’s degree in the subject they’re teaching or a master’s degree and some graduate coursework in the subject. It also requires high schools and community colleges to designate individuals responsible for negotiating what individual dual credit agreements look like.

“HB 2967 reinforces the vital role that strong, robust partnerships between community colleges and high schools play in delivering high quality dual credit programs,” Illinois Community College Board Executive Director Brian Durham said in a statement. “These programs help students get a head start on their college education and a path towards career success.”

The bill also requires schools to consider in-state colleges and universities when setting up dual credit programs over out-of-state institutions.

The bill also creates a committee made up of education officials, representatives from two different statewide teachers’ unions and others to work on improving dual credit programs’ accessibility and quality, as updating a template used by school districts to develop dual credit agreements with community colleges.

Four-year degrees at community college

One key proposal didn’t make the cut this spring — a measure allowing community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees. Despite being backed by Pritzker in his State of the State address earlier this year, it faced pushback in the General Assembly, which did not pass a bill implementing the policy.

That proposal drew concerns from some lawmakers who worried it could undercut programs to attract local students to state universities. In particular, some lawmakers worried that it could hurt schools like Northeastern Illinois University and Chicago State University, which serve largely minority student populations.

But Pritzker on Monday said he would continue working on a proposal to allow more schools to offer bachelor’s degrees in “very specific, niche areas” like nursing and advanced manufacturing.

“You sometimes have to work two, four, six years, maybe longer to get something done,” Pritzker said.

The Supreme Court has ruled on a previous case in favor of upholding the California law, which opponents argue puts an unfair burden on pork producers by impacting their ability to sell to the state. 
The IPPA lawsuit argued Proposition 12, which voters approved in 2018, imposed excessive burdens on interstate commerce and discriminated against out-of-state farmers.

The case was heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled in June 2024, in favor of California. IPPA filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the decision, which is the petition the court denied Monday.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led more than 20 attorneys general from other ag-producing states on an amici curiae in support of the IPPA appeal to the Supreme Court. 
Bird said in a statement Monday she was disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision. 
“Laws like this hurt Iowa’s rural communities and make it more difficult for Americans to enjoy the world-class pork products they have come to love and expect out of our state,” Bird said. 
Bird said she would continue to fight against similar laws, including a Massachusetts law against which the attorney general also led an amici curiae with other states, urging for an appeal. 
“States like California and Massachusetts should not dictate Iowa farming practices,” Bird said. 
The California law, which went into effect in 2024, stipulates that regardless of where an animal was raised, it must comply with the state regulation on animal confinement in order to be sold in California. The law stipulates sow enclosures must have at least 24 square feet of room. The law, which passed as a state referendum, was supported by animal rights organizations that say this spacing would give the animals enough space to turn around freely. 
The west-coast state is a major pork consumer, meaning its laws have a big impact on pork production across the country and in states like Iowa, which produces the most pork in the nation. 
Pork producers said the law would disrupt the pork supply chain and raise costs at the consumer level, as producers retrofit their facilities to comply with the law. 
Eldon McAfee, counsel for IPPA, said the organization was “disappointed, obviously” by the decision and that many pork producers “don’t understand” how a California law “can be enforced here in Iowa.” 
McAfee said producers believe this should be a marketplace decision driven by consumer and producer choice, not an enforcement. 
“We do not believe it can be mandated by law, we believe it is unconstitutional,” McAfee said. “But the court disagreed in the NPPC case and declined to accept this case.” 
McAfee referenced a Supreme Court decision against the National Pork Producers Council’s petition of the California law. 
He said while the court did not issue an explanation of the decision, the docket entries show justices discussed the case seven times before eventually declining the petition, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh dissenting. 
McAfee said the next step forward is legislative action. 
“The courts have stated the basic premise that it is the federal government, Congress, that regulates interstate commerce,” McAfee said. “We believe the best option is federal legislation … to prevent this type of law.” 
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, a Republican from Iowa, has also been a vocal opponent of Proposition 12, working with other Republicans in Iowa and other states to advance legislation the past several years that would supersede the state law. 
“This mandate on Iowa hog farmers increases pork prices for families, makes hog farming needlessly more expensive, harms our rural communities, and threatens our food security,” Feenstra said in a statement Monday. “I remain committed to getting a new, five-year Farm Bill signed into law that repeals Prop 12 and delivers certainty and clarity for our hog farmers.”

Jeff Landry has vetoed a conservative nutrition bill, using his veto message to swipe at a fellow Republican who is now running for U.S. Senate. (Hillary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Gov. Jeff Landry has vetoed a conservative nutrition bill, using his veto message to swipe at a fellow Republican who is now running for U.S. Senate. 
Senate Bill 117 by Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, is very similar to another piece of legislation championed by Landry, but it got the veto pen. In his veto letter, Landry made a slew of gun references seemingly taking aim at Miguez’s senate campaign, which was launched earlier this month in video that shows off Miguez’s sharp-shooting skills. 
Landry’s preferred similar legislation, Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, which Landry signed into law last week standing next to U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
It passed after a  “full-caliber collaborative effort,” Landry wrote to Miguez. McMath’s bill also goes “further downrange,” Landry said, while Miguez’s bill “leaves some harmful ingredients in the chamber.” 
McMath’s bill also “loads the health initiative with a broader scope,” and requires medical professionals to “reload their knowledge,” Landry continued. 
Landry also wrote that Miguez’s bill seems “like a misfire.” 
“In short, these two bills fire at some of the same targets, but SB 14 is a well-aimed tool that will Make Louisiana Healthy Again,” Landry wrote. 
Miguez has not yet responded to a request for comment. 
Both bills are part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemicals in foods that Kennedy has targeted for elimination. 
While Miguez and Landry are largely ideologically aligned, the two have clashed in recent months since Miguez criticized Landry’s tax reform package.

Medicaid was their salvation.The front-page headlines in the last few days have been jarring: “Medicaid Cuts May Force Retirees out of Nursing Homes.”
While much of the battle over Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax breaks for billionaires is theoretical to many of us who’ve always had health insurance and coverage for things like rehab and even nursing homes, this information hit home for me. 
In 1999, over Labor Day weekend, my mother had a paralytic stroke that left her entire right side lifeless. Although her mind was unimpaired, most of what she cared about in life was deeply affected. Since early childhood she had been a pianist, eventually a very fine one trained at the University of Louisville. Her days at the keyboard were ended. So was her ability to walk, to take care of basic chores, even to bathe. So was her ability to spend time with her grandchildren, and to entertain the family for holidays.
Yet her heart, at age 75, was still strong and her will to live was, at least for a time, unflinching. But within six months or so, after long treatment in a rehab center, Medicare required that she go home or go on full pay.  
My parents lived the American dream in the postwar era. They were comfortably off, owned their own home, and educated their two sons — with no student loans. But even in 1999, they couldn’t afford, for very long, the steep prices that nursing homes charged. So Mother came home in a wheelchair, where she remained under my aged father’s care until he could bear it no longer. The family housekeeper, who had cared for my grandmother until she died, was as old as Mother, so she wasn’t up to the task either. 
One night in April 2000 the call came from my brother that my father was so ill that he was unable to rise from the living room sofa. Within an hour, he was in an emergency room, dying of congestive heart failure. 
He was brought back to life by one of Louisville’s great cardiac surgeons, Morris Weiss, but for the rest of his life he was frail and dependent on medicine, walked with a cane, and was unable to take my mother back home. Alas, nursing home care was the only option for her,
My father was always very private about his finances, so I never quite knew when, but his savings (and Mother’s) dried up and she was transferred to Medicaid. He was even reluctant to speak of it. We all thought Medicaid was for indigents, or the terribly disabled. 
 Turns out, Medicaid was for us. I learned that a lot of nursing homes welcomed Medicaid residents. An attorney who specialized in issues involving the aged advised our family. Then an elderly aunt died and left Mother some money. Immediately she went back onto private pay until those dollars were gobbled up. So back on Medicaid she went. 
Meanwhile Daddy sold our family home, which gave him some money for emergencies but very few pleasures. He moved into a nice senior citizens’ complex, designed for independent living, with group meals and activities. He made friends and played cards and was close enough to Mother’s nursing home to pay daily visits. Then, his health began to fail.
For a time there was a very real prospect that both of them would be in nursing homes at the same time. Then, in the spring of 2008, each began a further decline. Mother decided that enough was enough. She told me and my Aunt Rose, “I want to die.” And so she did, by declining food and medication. She ended her days in a palliative care unit in St. Matthews, only a few blocks from where she had lived the happiest days of her life. In retrospect, I think she died of a broken heart.
A month later, her older sister Lucille died at the ripe old age of 91, in her own home surrounded by loved ones. And then, just after July 4, my father joined them, passing from life in the very same corridor as my mother, attended by the same nurses. It was a blessing.
It is too painful for me to imagine what would have happened if Mother had been thrown out of the nursing home for inability to pay. “Tax reform” – Donald Trump-style – might well make that happen. It is despicable legislation, the product of a time when lowering taxes for the rich “trumps” caring for the people who made this country great through hard work and patriotism. I don’t think my father went to fight in World War II to save a nation where the super-rich call the shots.
If this is a “big, beautiful bill” in the eyes of some, to me, it is a cancer in the American soul.

Investigators who’ve looked into the robocalls across Michigan, Ohio and New York found that Burkman and Wohl were responsible for about 85,000 robocalls before the 2020 election, which attempted to discourage voters of color from participating.
In Michigan, Burkman and Wohl each face four felony charges for voter intimidation and other violations to state election law.
Michigan’s Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel filed charges against Burkman and Wohl in 2020 with her office reporting the pair made thousands of calls to communities of color including 12,000 calls to residents with a 313 area code, the area code for Detroit, a predominantly Black city.
According to Nessel’s office, the calls spread false and intimidating information to voters including that voting by mail could lead to police departments using their information to find people with outstanding warrants or allow credit card companies to collect outstanding debts.

It’s been almost five years since Nessel filed criminal charges against Burkman and Wohl and in a news release Monday, she said she’s ready for the case to proceed and the state’s highest court’s decision on Friday to not hear the pair’s appeal will help the case reach an end.
“I am pleased that the Michigan Supreme Court refused to entertain further delay tactics by denying to hear this appeal,” Nessel said in the news release. “Voter intimidation is a direct attack on the fundamental right to vote, and I look forward to finally bringing this matter to trial.” 
In New York, Burkman and Wohl reached a settlement with the state’s attorney general’s office in 2024 to pay up to $1.25 million targeting thousands of Black voters in New York during the 2020 election. 
In Ohio, Burkman and Wohl were ordered by a court in 2022 to spend 500 hours registering people to vote after prosecutors said the men organized more than 3,000 robocalls to Cleveland-area residents, according to The Associated Press.

Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, pictured Jan. 13 speaking at a press conference, is the author of a bill that created the Oklahoma National Guard CareerTech Assistance Program. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma National Guard members may be eligible for tuition assistance to pay for CareerTech programs, but lawmakers did not allocate funding to pay for the program in its first budget year. 
Senate Bill 31, authored by Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, created the Oklahoma National Guard CareerTech Assistance Program to provide up to three years of assistance to eligible Guard members who enroll in a technology center school. 
While program availability is subject to funding, no funding was allocated by the state Legislature this session while the program continues to be built out. 
The measure’s House author, Rep. Judd Strom, R-Copan, said funding was not an immediate necessity for the program. It could take from six to eight months for the Oklahoma National Guard and CareerTech to work out the details of the program and application, he said. 
The bill created an account specifically for the program at the Oklahoma Treasury, so the military is able to allocate money to it but legislative conversations about funding it could continue next session, Strom said. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma National Guard said the program is subject to the availability of funding, but is prepared to move forward with it once money is allocated.
The budget impact is dependent on participation, but the average tuition and fees amount per student is $2,170, according to a Senate Fiscal report. 
The measure became law in May without the signature of Gov. Kevin Stitt. 
Hicks praised the bipartisan support for her bill in a statement. The House voted 78-5 to pass the measure and the Senate passed it unanimously. 
“Our Oklahoma National Guard members are a critical part of our national defense, and in times of natural disaster here at home, assist our local emergency personnel and first responders in helping their friends and neighbors,” Hicks said. “Extending this education benefit to our guard members is a recognition of their service and sacrifice that will help further their success, in uniform and civilian life.”
Hicks on Monday referred questions about the program’s funding to Strom.
Eligibility is limited to members of the National Guard who have at least one year left on their enlistment contract and agree to complete it. They must also agree to 24 months of active service after completing their last semester they received assistance for. 
Those receiving assistance are required to maintain a 2.0 GPA, continue participation in the Guard and have a Military Occupational Specialty or Air Force Specialty Code after their first semester. 
“We are proud to support Oklahomans who serve our country through the National Guard, and we’re grateful the state is investing in their future through CareerTech tuition assistance,” said CareerTech Director Brett Haken in a statement. “This legislation recognizes the value of high-skill, high-demand training and helps ensure that those who serve are equipped with the tools they need to succeed in the workforce. It’s a win for our service members, a win for our employers, and a win for Oklahoma’s economy.”
Failure to comply with the eligibility requirements means a Guard member must repay the amount of the assistance given. Before seeking assistance through this program, a Guard member must also apply for federal grants and scholarships.

Bob Ferguson, center, met with several statewide elected officials in June to discuss how federal funding cuts under discussion in Congress and by the Trump administration could impact the state. (Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000. South Carolina’s rate of 9.9 per 100,000 people is in roughly the middle.



“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

“These audit findings, based on sample testing of a much larger population of billions of dollars in transactions, are a sober reminder that we’ve got to do better,” State Auditor Mike Foley said Monday in a statement.
A 30-page letter sent to 15 state agencies identified concerns such as: alleged fraud from Workers’ Compensation Court benefits; excessive personal vehicle mileage; and improper reimbursement for tuition, bonuses and moving expenses.
 ‘Simple search’ 

The auditing team cited specific examples in the report made public Monday. Among them:
The Worker’s Compensation Court allegedly sent inappropriate payments totaling $18,900 to the account of a former public employee who died last year, auditors noted after comparing state payments to death records. A daughter’s alleged use of the monthly benefit payments raised possible violations of state law, the report said.
The daughter appeared confused about the situation, according to the audit team. The Workers’ Compensation Court said it recovered the full overpayment amount soon after the problem was uncovered and is working to improve procedures and death confirmations.
Similarly, the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems reportedly made a retirement payment of nearly $2,900 to someone who had died.
And the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services paid two deceased individuals $1,500 each from a workforce stabilization grant funded from American Rescue Plan Act funds, the report said.
DHHS had not been aware of the deaths, according to the audit team, but quickly began a process to recoup the funds. Foley noted that a “simple search” of the department’s vital records database was readily available.
A review of tuition reimbursement benefits for state employees uncovered as much as $122,431 that should have been repaid because the state employee left their post before a specified time period, Foley said.

The situation arose in at least four state agencies, according to the audit team, which reviewed back to 2022. In the Department of Correctional Services, for example, 24 workers left jobs within one year of completing higher education coursework, costing taxpayers as much as $67,843 in tuition subsidies that weren’t paid back, Foley said. 
For Health and Human Services, over a three-year period, Foley said that 29 employees reportedly left state service within a year of receiving $49,002 in total tuition subsidies without repayment.
The audit team noted that the Corrections policy allows an employee up to $10,000 each fiscal year in tuition reimbursements. Auditors reported that one employee was reimbursed a total of $11,286 for courses in a fiscal year, an alleged overpayment of $1,286.
Inconsistent policies 
Tuition reimbursement is inconsistent among state agencies. Certain department policies state that employees “may” be required to reimburse if they leave employment within a certain amount of time. DHHS said repayment request had not been a recent practice, and said that it would investigate options going forward. The Nebraska Supreme Court said it had actively sought repayment, but as of last July suspended the benefit.
A Corrections manager said the agency had not actively been seeking repayment, though Foley noted it was required under the agency’s policy during the period reviewed. The agency told auditors it would update its policy to require repayment with a warning that noncompliance would be recorded in a personnel file.
When it came to hiring and retention incentives, the auditing team alleged that four state agencies potentially overpaid a total of $17,000 to former employees who did not fulfill requirements. The review went back to July 2023.
Additionally, Foley said, auditors reviewed 20 Nebraska Department of Transportation recruits who received reimbursement for moving expenses but left their jobs within a year. That review went back to 2020. Of those, 17 did not repay as required and the auditor estimated the lost amount at $13,828. 
Transportation managers told the audit team, led by manager Dakota Christensen, that it has since taken steps to reinforce compliance.

In another situation, Foley called it “a gross inefficiency” that an inspector with the Nebraska Brand Committee was reimbursed $92,789 for personal vehicle mileage over 3.5 years. Inspectors oversee and regulate cattle branding in the state. Foley contends that such high mileage costs could be reduced with the assignment of a state vehicle. 
 The little things 

Foley said “a lot of little things” add up to government inefficiencies and should be a focus along with larger budget cuts.
“The goal of minimizing the cost of government services can be achieved only if every public employee maintains an attitude of respect for the hard-working Nebraska citizens whose taxes pay our salaries,” Foley said.
The 15 agencies who received the auditor’s letter: Attorney General’s Office; Nebraska Supreme Court; Workers’ Compensation Court; Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems; Brand Committee; Tax Equalization and Review Commission; Legislative Council; Corn Board; Real Estate Commission and the Departments of Health and Human Services; Environmental and Energy; Correctional Services; Transportation; Veterans’ Affairs, and Administrative Services.

(Erika Bolstad/Stateline)A controversial provision to sell off federal public land, including in Washington state, has been removed from the Republican tax cut and spending bill now under consideration in the U.S. Senate. 
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced a narrowed version of the proposal last week after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled his original plan, which would have made millions of acres eligible for sale, was out of order. 
Over the weekend, Lee said he was preemptively withdrawing the slimmed-down version, which covered U.S. Bureau of Land Management property that met certain criteria. 
“Over the past several weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to members of the community, local leaders, and stakeholders across the country,” Lee said in a statement on social media. “While there has been a tremendous amount of misinformation – and in some cases, outright lies – about my bill, many people brought forward sincere concerns.” 
Lee said he chose to withdraw the land sale proposal because the constraints of the fast-track process being used to move the GOP budget legislation did not allow him to secure safeguards to guarantee land would be sold to “American families” rather than “foreign interests.” 
The senator’s proposals drew widespread criticism.
“This was a wrongheaded proposal that had no place in this reconciliation bill. Many western Senators who know the value of recreational lands objected to its inclusion,” U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash, said in a statement after Lee dropped his latest proposal. “I am glad our special places will still be available for everyone.”
Last week, U.S. Rep Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., and four other Republicans in the U.S. House said in a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson that they would not vote for the “One Big Beautiful Bill” if it called for selling federal public land.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-30 20:37:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,Feds unfreeze $137 million in Mississippi education money,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/30/feds-unfreeze-mississippi-education-money/,The decision comes less than three months after the federal government revoked billions nationwide as part of Trump administration efforts to cut government spending.,"The federal government is restoring $137 million in education funds to Mississippi schools.
The U.S. Department of Education notified states last week that it would reinstate pandemic relief funds. The decision comes less than three months after the federal government revoked billions nationwide as part of Trump administration efforts to cut government spending. 
State education agencies and school districts originally had until March 2026 to spend the money, but the federal government claimed that because the pandemic was over, they had no use for the money. 
That March 2026 deadline has been reinstated following a series of injunctive orders. 
A coalition of Democratic-led states sued the federal government in April over the decision to withhold the money. Then, a federal judge granted plaintiff states injunctive orders in the case, which meant those states could continue spending their COVID-relief dollars while other states remained restricted.
But the education department decided that wasn’t fair, wrote Secretary Linda McMahon in a letter dated June 26, so the agency was restoring the money to all states, not just the ones involved in the lawsuit. 
“The original intent of the policy announced on March 28 was to treat all states consistently with regards to safeguarding and refocusing their remaining COVID-era grant funding on students,” she wrote. “The ongoing litigation has created basic fairness and uniformity problems.”
The Mississippi Department of Education notified school districts about the decision on Friday. 
In the meantime, schools and states have been requesting exemptions for individual projects, though many from across the country have been denied. 
Eleven Mississippi school districts had submitted requests to use the money to fund services such as tutoring and counseling, according to records requested by Mississippi Today, though those are now void because of the federal government’s decision. 
Starting immediately, school districts can submit new requests to the state education department to have their federal allocation reinstated.
Mississippi Today previously reported that about 70 school districts were relying on the federal funds to pay for a range of initiatives, including construction projects, mental health services and literacy programs. 
In 2023, almost half of Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds, pandemic relief money allocated to schools across the country, went to students’ academic, social, and emotional needs. A third went to operational and staff costs, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Education.
Though Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann previously said that legislative leaders might consider helping agencies that were impacted by federal funding cuts, House Speaker Jason White said Monday that he did not have an appetite for directing state funds to pandemic-era programs. 
Small school districts were already feeling the impact of the federal government’s decision to rescind the money. In May, Greenwood Leflore Consolidated School Board voted to terminate a contract on a school construction project funded with federal dollars. 
The litigation is ongoing, so the funding could again be rescinded.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05004024/Eastside-Elementary-1.jpg,,,2025-06-30 17:13:02.934962

The hike is the most prominent piece of a six-year, $3.2 billion package passed by the Washington Legislature and signed by Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this year.
Lawmakers turned to the tax to contend with a projected $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year transportation budget. Officials said this was caused by an inflation-fueled surge in construction costs and flattening gas tax receipts as more drivers opt for electric vehicles and as cars have become more fuel efficient.
“This will keep projects on track and ensure the promises we’ve made can be kept,” said state Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “As you drive around and see those orange cones, that’s where your money is at work.”
Tuesday’s increase will push the state’s per-gallon tax rate on gas and other vehicle fuels from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. Starting July 1, 2026, it will rise each year by 2% — about a penny annually — to account for inflation.
Also Tuesday, the state tax on diesel will climb an additional 3 cents, so 9 cents total, to 58.4 cents, then go up another 3 cents two years later. That additional 6 cents applied to diesel will be subject to a 2% boost each year starting July 1, 2028.

 Only California, Pennsylvania will have higher state gas taxes than Washington

Washington will have the nation’s third-highest state gas tax behind California and Pennsylvania. Connecticut is currently at 52.4 cents, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.
Washington’s state tax is on top of federal fuel taxes, which are 18.4 cents for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel.
Hiking the gas tax is expected to raise $1.4 billion over the next six years. The diesel tax is counted on to bring in $166 million over that time.
These increases are two of the larger entrees in the transportation package’s smorgasbord of new taxes and higher fees.
Under the legislation, passenger vehicle weight fees are going up a few dollars. The added sales tax for vehicles will climb from 0.3% to 0.5%.
There’s also a new 8% tax on the portion of the selling price of vehicles above $100,000 and a 10% tax on non-commercial aircraft sales above $500,000.
There’s a temporary increase in the rental car tax as well, from 5.9% to 11.9%, before moving down to 9.9% in 2027.
And there’s more.
The tire disposal fee will go from $1 apiece to $5 apiece. Washington State Ferries will boost its vessel replacement surcharge by 50 cents in October and start imposing a 3% fee for those who pay with credit cards next year.
This week’s increase in gas and diesel taxes may not be immediately noticeable.
The state collects those taxes before fuel gets pumped. They are paid by the distributor — the business that buys or imports gasoline and transports it to the neighborhood gas station. Distributors will decide how they pass their costs onto the station owner, who must decide if they will pass on any added costs to customers.
Washington created a motor vehicle fuel tax in 1921. It applied to special fuels, too, according to the state Department of Licensing.
The last gas tax boost totaled 11.9 cents and anchored the Connecting Washington transportation package passed by the Legislature in 2015. It led to increases of 7 cents per gallon in July 2015 and 4.9 cents a year later.
Washington gas prices are higher now than a year ago. The average price of a gallon of regular gas was $4.45 on Friday compared to $4.33 in 2024, according to AAA. Nationally, the average price was $3.20 on Friday.
Critics of the state’s Climate Commitment Act, which requires refineries and other businesses to pay for their air pollution, say that law has pushed up gas prices in recent years.

(Photo by Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)Rhode Island’s plan to bring in more offshore wind power appears at risk of washing away after a fourth delay to a scheduled contract signing with a project developer.
Caroline Pretyman, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, confirmed in an email Monday that the utility provider has again extended negotiations with SouthCoast Wind, citing uncertainty over federal legislation affecting offshore wind projects. The news comes the same day the two parties were set to ink an agreement locking in commitments and pricing for Rhode Island to buy 200 megawatts of wind-powered electricity from the project planned south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.
And, it’s less than a month before a public hearing on the proposed cable burial plan for the wind turbines, which requires state regulatory approval to cross Aquidneck Island. 
A new schedule posted to Rhode Island Energy’s offshore wind procurement website Monday afternoon sets a new deadline of Nov. 1 to finalize a contract, with an important caveat.
“Rhode Island Energy may terminate the project’s conditional selection if negotiations are not successful prior to this date,” the company states in the update. It’s the first time the utility supplier has acknowledged the possibility that the tentative agreement might be canceled.
Pretyman said additional details were not available Monday. 
But the ongoing uncertainty is hardly a surprise given the current climate in D.C.
President Donald Trump made good on his anti-wind campaign promises the day he took office, with a first-day executive order halting new offshore wind leases. SouthCoast Wind already secured the bulk of the federal approvals prior to the change in administration. But the project is now facing delays in securing the last three federal permits needed to move forward, Michael Brown, CEO for Ocean Winds, the project’s parent company, said in a June 10 affidavit included in a legal challenge to the administration over its wind directives.
The federal agencies reviewing the permit applications cited Trump’s Jan. 20 memo as the reason for delays, Brown said in the affidavit. He specifically mentioned pending agreements with Rhode Island and Massachusetts utility providers were at risk.
“Without clarity on when or how issues arising under the Presidential Memorandum will be resolved, it may be impossible for the parties to execute the PPAs,” Brown wrote.










Rhode Island Energy may terminate the project’s conditional selection if negotiations are not successful prior to this date.


– Update posted to Rhode Island Energy’s offshore wind procurement website 


Brown’s written testimony is part of a lawsuit led by 17 state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, seeking to stop the Trump administration from halting the offshore wind sector. The lawsuit continues to play out in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, with a Sept. 4 hearing on whether a federal judge should issue a ruling in the case, according to the court docket.
Brown said Monday resolving the dispute over Trump’s offshore wind memo was “critical” to the future of the company’s project.
“It is critical that the special review called for by the Presidential Memorandum be resolved as soon as possible to ensure that regulatory instability does not jeopardize the viability of large infrastructure projects like SouthCoast Wind,” Brown said. “We are grateful for the continued collaboration with our Massachusetts and Rhode Island partners.”
The cost of walking away
SouthCoast has already invested more than $600 million over the last seven years in developing, permitting, engineering and other preparations related to its project, according to court filings. Walking away now means giving up that investment, as well as the expected profits from selling power.
Meanwhile, Rhode Island’s foothold in the still-nascent offshore wind sector, as well as its ability to meet mandated decarbonization benchmarks, rests upon buying more offshore wind power.
A single offshore wind project like the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project under construction south of Block Island, can offset over 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year — just shy of 10% of the gross greenhouse gas emissions tracked from Rhode Island in 2022. 
The 200 megawatts of additional “nameplate capacity” from SouthCoast would provide enough electricity to power another 125,000 homes in the Ocean State, and even more — 1.4 million homes — in Massachusetts, based on its tentative agreement to buy the remaining 1,087 megawatts of power from the project.
Massachusetts utility providers have also pushed back the deadline to finalize a contract with the project developers to no later than Dec. 31, Lauren Diggin, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources said in an email Monday.
If approved, power contracts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts would also need to be reviewed and approved by their respective state utility regulators, who have final authority over long-term renewable energy contracts. Rhode Island’s newly revised schedule sets a Dec. 31 deadline for a final contract and price agreement to be submitted to the Public Utilities Commission. Previously, the contract was scheduled to be submitted to utility regulators by Aug. 25, based on a June 30 finalization.
Meanwhile, a separate state regulatory body, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board, is forging ahead with its own, independent review of the project’s cable burial plan. A public hearing on July 23 at Portsmouth Middle School will offer the chance for in-person input on the plan to run underwater power lines up the Sakonnet River, cross the northern end of Portsmouth and extend out into Mount Hope Bay.

Meeting state decarbonization mandates
Despite setbacks, advocates remained bullish on the need to grow Rhode Island’s renewable energy portfolio, including through offshore wind. 
A consortium of state agencies charged with planning how to meet the state’s mandated decarbonization benchmarks under the 2021 Act on Climate Law is expected to release a detailed report on next steps by the end of the year. Meanwhile, a five-member Senate study panel created in the 2025 legislative session will soon begin its own, complementary review of the Act on Climate law, with a report due in May 2026.
Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat who sponsored the resolution to create the study commission, said the intent is not to water down the existing state emissions reduction mandates, but to determine how to meet them.
“If you look at the way our emissions reduction strategy was set up, it involves a lot of switching over from fossil fuels to electricity, and to have that electricity come from renewable sources,” Zurier said in an interview Monday. “With that said, there are different ways to accomplish that.”
Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and co-chair of Climate Jobs Rhode Island, was also undeterred by the latest setback in SouthCoast wind contract negotiations.
“Delays can be frustrating, but the end result — a union-built, decarbonized economy — will be worth it,” Crowley said in a text message.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office referred inquiries for comment to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.
“We continue to monitor the potential outcomes and changes to federal renewable energy laws and tax credits being discussed within the reconciliation legislation in Washington,” Robert Beadle, a spokesperson for the state energy office, said in an email.

DemasA ballot initiative is in the works to ban corporations with large existing or pending government contracts from making political contributions to candidates for office and sitting lawmakers.
Taking Back Our Power, a coalition backing the initiative, announced Monday its plans to get language approved for signature collection. The aim is to get the proposal before voters on the 2026 general election ballot.
Michigan law currently allows powerful monopolies and large government contractors, like DTE Energy, Consumers Energy and insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, to gain political influence via campaign and political action committee contributions, which can often evade public transparency and accountability, the group said Monday.
That’s where Michiganders for Money Out of Politics aims to make a difference. The ballot committee backed by Taking Back Our Power says it seeks to restore Michigan’s democratic systems by putting people over corporate profits.
The coalition consists of Michigan advocacy groups like Clean Water Action, Climate Cabinet, Community Change Action, Detroit Action, Emergent Justice, Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, Michigan League of Conservation Voters, Michigan United Action, MOSES Action, Progress Michigan, and Voters Not Politicians. 
The latter group was instrumental in helping create the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, which put state legislative and congressional redistricting in the hands of an independent, citizen-led commission instead of the Michigan Legislature.
The goal of Taking Back Our Power is to get the language and the summary before the Michigan Board of State Canvassers in July for approval to start collecting signatures.
Members of the group held a virtual news conference on Monday afternoon to extol the necessity of the measure.
Sean McBrearty, the state director of Clean Water Action, said that the corrosive influence of corporate money on state politics drowns out the voices of Michigan residents.
“The worst examples of this influence come when corporations that are reliant on government support and intervention for their profits, namely monopoly utilities and government contractors, spend huge amounts of money ensuring that they have the support of lawmakers who are supposed to be voting in the best interests of their constituents,” McBrearty said.
  Sean McBrearty of Clean Water Action at the Huron River in Milford, Aug. 10, 2022 | Kyle Davidson
For example, McBrearty said that in 2022, DTE gave money to 138 out of the 148 state House representatives and state Senators in Lansing. In 2023, he said DTE gave $100,000 to a nonprofit tied to former House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) while DTE residents were without power in the midst of winter storms.
“Unsurprisingly, a huge grassroots push for greater utility accountability fell on deaf ears in Lansing after that contribution,” McBrearty said.
Tate, who is running for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, has yet to respond to a request by Michigan Advance for comment on McBrearty’s statement.
Taking Back Our Power attempted over the last two years to address DTE’s and Consumers’ political contributions via legislation. Bills were introduced last term and were reintroduced this term. Despite broad bipartisan support, the bills weren’t given a hearing last term.
McBrearty, the vice chair of the new ballot committee, noted that state Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), who aligns ideologically with Democratic Socialists, and state Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton), a deeply conservative member of the Michigan House Freedom Caucus, led the way on that legislation. They both have endorsed the campaign to prevent monopolies like DTE and Consumers Energy from having an outsized influence over state politics.
DeSana is the only Republican noted on a list shared by the group that details which legislators have pledged to support the effort and what it’s trying to accomplish.
Getting dark money out of Lansing has been an uphill battle for those waging war against it, but some advances have been made in recent years, including the prosecutions surrounding the Unlock Michigan scandal.
Kim Murphy-Kovalick, programs director with Voters Not Politicians, said the committee will leverage grassroots power to get it across the finish line. The coalition’s individual member organizations have already started training volunteers and staff on the amendment and the rules of petition circulation. Public town hall events were soon to follow, she said.

Reporters asked Taking Back Our Power if they had received any response from DTE or Consumers on the matter. McBrearty said they had not and were not prioritizing those companies in terms of public outreach and feedback, adding that the group would instead stay focused on people and getting the message to them.
DTE told The Detroit News on Monday that it has complied with all corporate donation and political contribution laws.
The initiative is focused on utilities and other businesses with large government contracts in excess of $250,000. When asked why the ballot initiative was essentially stopping at utility companies, McBrearty said the group studied a list of state contractors when it was making its legislative moves. Concerns abounded during that work, McBrearty said, and led to the meat of the Michiganders for Money Out of Politics proposal. 
The $250,000 figure was chosen because Taking Back Our Power saw that the companies getting state contracts at less than $250,000 were largely service based, like lawn mowing. 
“Lawn mowing, laundry, cleaning, office buildings. … They’re not the people who are buying our government,” McBrearty said. “We want to stop the corrupt practices of corporations that are getting these huge contracts and the regulated utilities from buying our government, and so those who are getting smaller contracts are not the ones that we’re concerned about.”
Targeting a ban on political contributions from regulated monopolies was the path forward to start addressing dark money concerns because there was precedent for that, McBrearty added.
“Secondly, there’s a strong record of fact that the contributions of DTE, Consumers and others who fall into that category have a corrupting influence on the legislative process in Lansing,” he said. “I think this is definitely not a cure all for all the problems with campaign finance and with our democracy. This is … a major step forward that will make things more accountable and more representative of the people of Michigan in Lansing.”
Ranked choice voting initiative to start collecting signatures
While Michiganders for Money Out of Politics gets its wheels in motion, a ballot initiative to amend the Michigan Constitution for ranked choice voting during future elections was approved late last week by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers. The effort will soon start collecting signatures.
The petition form and a 100-word summary for the Rank MI Vote initiative were approved Friday. Rank MI Vote also wants to place the question on the 2026 ballot, which could see high turnout from voters. 
Under ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates from first to last. If no candidate receives a majority of first-place votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the second-place votes on those ballots are then distributed to the remaining candidates. That process continues until a candidate reaches a majority and is declared the winner. 
Michiganders in 2026 will elect a new governor, secretary of state, attorney general, U.S. Senator and decide who controls the state Senate.
The Rank MI Vote amendment aims to implement the voting system for most federal and state elections. To appear on the 2026 ballot, the committee will have to collect 446,198 valid signatures within a six-month window. Rank MI Vote in a statement said that it has begun distributing educational materials explaining ranked choice voting.
The group cited Pew Research Center data that shows 65% of U.S. voters reported dissatisfaction with the nation’s political climate. Rank MI Vote Executive Director Pat Zabawa said those feelings have helped elevate the ranked choice voting issue and has led to success thus far in volunteer recruitment.
“You’ve got nearly two in three voters saying they’re fed up with politics; they don’t need us to tell them that no one’s looking out for them anymore and political campaigns have become one scorched-earth ad blitz after another,” Zabawa said. “But their ears perk up when we explain how ranked choice voting changes political parties and candidates’ incentives, encouraging more positive, collegial, issues-focused campaigns. That message resonates strongly with just about everyone we talk to, and it’s starting to break through in a big way.” 
Ranked choice voting is currently allowed statewide in Alaska and Maine. Other states have ranked choice voting at the local level, like St. Paul, Minnesota, and several cities in the San Francisco Bay area, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The voting system had a national spotlight during last week’s New York City mayoral primary elections, which helped propel Democrat Zohran Mamdani to a presumed victory in a first round of voting on June 24.
Using ranked choice voting comes with the promise of electing a more diverse set of candidates, like Mamdani in New York, who pulled off a major upset by besting former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace.
“Trump and Slotkin both winning Michigan last year with fewer than half the votes moved the needle for a number of Michigan voters,” Zabawa said. “But when Mike Duggan declared his candidacy for governor as an independent, suddenly everyone’s speculating about the spoiler effect and which party Duggan will pull more votes from. People are really fired up about majority winners because it’s no longer some distant, theoretical possibility. It’s possible our next governor could win with less than 35% of the vote.”
Also approved on Friday was the Voters To Stop Pay Cuts ballot initiative, which seeks to upend Public Act 1 of 2025, which created a new minimum wage scheme after a long court battle over two 2018 initiative petitions that were adopted before they could go before voters and gutted by the Legislature in the same session. 
Public Act 1 set minimum wage $12.48 in 2025, $13.73 in 2026, and $15 an hour starting in 2026. The act also kept tipped wages intact and raised their percentage of hourly wage on a graduated scale up until 2030, much like it did with non-tipped workers’ minimum wage.
Voters to Stop Pay Cuts would like that law exorcised from statute, with referendum language arguing that Public Act 1 reduced the minimum wage for tipped workers and changed the way future inflation adjustments for minimum wage increases occurred in the future.
Canvassers gave the greenlight to Voters To Stop Pay Cuts’ petition form and summary on Friday.

Tim Kaine, D-Va. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a series of amendments Monday to the Republican-led budget package moving through Congress, arguing the legislation would slash essential services and disproportionately benefit the wealthy. 
A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Kaine said his amendments are designed to blunt some of what he called the proposal’s “worst of the worst” provisions.
“We should be focused on growing and supporting the middle-class, not passing Donald Trump and congressional Republicans’ ‘Hurt People, Kill Jobs, and Spike the Debt to Reward the Rich Act,’” Kaine said in a statement. 
“I’m filing amendments to protect Americans from some of the worst of the worst from this Administration and its partisan megabill — from safeguarding our rural hospitals and preventing Americans from losing their health insurance, to keeping families from going hungry, standing up for our veterans, and preventing energy cost increases.”


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The 940-page proposal, which Republicans are advancing using a procedural maneuver that allows it to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold in the Senate, would enact deep cuts to federal programs including Medicaid, food assistance, energy tax credits and emergency preparedness, while extending tax breaks for corporations and high-income earners.
Kaine’s amendments seek to address the legislation’s effects in Virginia and nationwide. Some of the proposed changes take direct aim at proposed spending cuts by reversing tax breaks for the wealthy and protecting funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
To protect health care access in rural parts of Virginia, Kaine proposed mitigating changes to the Medicaid provider tax program, which he warned could jeopardize the financial stability of community hospitals.
Veterans’ issues also feature prominently in Kaine’s response to the bill. He introduced an amendment to crack down on what he described as the Trump administration’s “mass firing of veterans from the federal workforce,” by requiring any such dismissals to be reported to Congress. Another measure would prohibit agencies from illegally firing federal employees or withholding congressionally appropriated funds.
Kaine’s proposals also address specific Virginia projects. 
One amendment would restore funding for the Richmond Water Treatment Plant, which was slated to receive a $12 million grant under the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. That grant, along with a $24 million allocation for upgrades to the Lake Meade Dam in Portsmouth, was canceled by the Trump administration, according to Kaine’s office.
Another amendment targets a provision that would authorize the transfer of the Space Shuttle Discovery from its current home at the National Air and Space Museum annex in Chantilly, Virginia, to Houston, Texas. Kaine argues the move would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions and restrict public access to the shuttle, which is currently available to view free of charge.
The budget bill’s energy provisions have drawn particular scrutiny from Kaine and outside advocacy groups. 
Several amendments filed by Kaine are aimed at preventing utility cost increases by blocking a proposed new excise tax on wind and solar power, and by preserving clean energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Kaine also filed an amendment to incorporate his bipartisan Jumpstarting Our Businesses By Supporting Students (JOBS) Act into the legislation. The proposal would allow federal Pell Grants to be used for shorter-term workforce training programs, a shift he says would help more Americans access good-paying jobs.
Other changes include reversing an estate tax cut for multimillionaires, aligning munitions procurement spending with NATO’s European Deterrence Initiative, protecting federal employee unions and requiring a full accounting of the bill’s fiscal impact to prevent budgetary sleight of hand.
Outside groups have also raised alarm over energy-related provisions in the latest version of the Trump-backed proposal, particularly changes made over the weekend as the Senate updated the legislative text for H.R. 1, now dubbed the “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
According to Appalachian Voices, the bill would raise electricity prices and restrict renewable energy development by repealing production and investment tax credits for wind and solar projects, and imposing a new excise tax of up to 50% on those sources — but not on fossil fuels.
“This will be extremely harmful for small businesses, utilities, and nonprofits,” Appalachian Voices said in a statement. “It blocks new energy construction that can help meet growing demand, and punishes project owners for delays beyond their control.”
The updated language requires solar and wind projects already under construction to be in service by Dec. 31, 2027, to qualify for federal tax credits — a deadline advocates say ignores the reality of permitting delays.
Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on X, formerly Twitter, that the excise tax “will increase prices” and should be removed, calling it poor policy regardless of the energy source.
Labor groups also weighed in. North America’s Building Trades Unions — representing more than 3 million workers — said the bill “takes their jobs away and undermines” national energy goals. “Slashing energy tax credits and layering on harmful restrictions is no way to power America’s future,” the union said.
Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, called the changes “a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry.” 
He warned that the move would “strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”
Kaine’s amendments are now part of a rapidly unfolding Senate process, as votes on the megabill are expected to take place this week. Whether any of the Virginia senator’s changes gain traction remains to be seen.

Seven states have enacted bans on lab-grown meat. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Texas is the fifth state this year and seventh overall to ban lab-grown meat after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation temporarily prohibiting the sale of cell-cultured protein.
Selling lab-grown meat, which is produced by growing cells acquired from living animals in a controlled environment, will be subject to civil and criminal penalties under the new law. It is set to go into effect in September and expires in two years.
“This ban is a massive win for Texas ranchers, producers, and consumers,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “Texans have a God-given right to know what’s on their plate, and for millions of Texans, it better come from a pasture, not a lab. It’s plain cowboy logic that we must safeguard our real, authentic meat industry from synthetic alternatives.”
Was that chicken cutlet grown in a lab? These states want you to know.

Consumers interested in sustainable foods that avoid the slaughter of animals are driving the growing cultured meat industry. The Texas beef industry supported the bill. The state leads the nation in cattle, contributing almost 15% of U.S. beef production, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Texas joins Indiana, Mississippi, Montana and Nebraska and in enacting new laws this year; Alabama and Florida did so last year. In March, the Oklahoma House approved a similar bill that later died in the Senate.
Texas followed Indiana’s lead in making its ban last for two years, which Indiana legislators said would allow more time for research. The time limit also may mean the law is less likely to draw legal challenges.
Upside Foods, one of the companies federally approved to sell cultivated meat, sued Florida shortly after the state passed the country’s first lab-grown meat ban. That lawsuit is pending.
In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave permission to two California-based companies to begin selling lab-produced chicken across the country. Their lab-grown chicken was briefly featured on the menu at two restaurants that same year.
Although cultivated meat isn’t sold in stores yet, some research suggests it could be better for the environment compared with traditional meat production.
But other research suggests lab-grown meat’s environmental impact could be higher than retail beef based on current production methods.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents boosted salaries of state university presidents and the chancellor an average of 6.4%, despite the Legislature’s decision to provide no more than 2.5% raises to campus employees lagging the farthest behind market rates.
The Legislature earmarked $36.2 million to address state employee pay disparities in the new fiscal year starting July 1. These targeted increases would bring state workers up to 10% below market rate or enact raises of 2.5%, whichever was greater. Lawmakers left it to university administrators to fill other compensation gaps, but the reality was some campus employees won’t get a raise.
The Board of Regents awarded University of Kansas Chancellor Doug Girod a 12% surge of $105,000 to place his total compensation from state government and private endowment sources at $1 million per year.
After meeting in executive session, the Board of Regents also voted Friday without dissent to authorize a 7% increase for Fort Hays State University President Tisa Mason to take her annual package to $355,000. Kansas State University President Richard Linton, who received a 10.2% raise last year, was provided a 5% increase this year to elevate his compensation to $750,000.
The low end of the scale were 4% adjustments for Wichita State University President Rick Muma and Emporia State University President Ken Hush. Muma’s annual compensation climbed to $635,000, while Hush’s was bumped to $370,000. The Board of Regents recently hired a new president for Pittsburg State University, so no raise was adopted for PSU.
“Some of the most important actions we take concern our CEOs,” said Carl Ice, chairman of the Board of Regents. “Leaders matter. Leaders set a vision — visions that are compelling.”
Becky Pottebaum, director of finance and administration with the Board of Regents, said the annual review of compensation for university leaders was designed to make certain salaries were based on performance and competitive with peer institutions.
The latest salary adjustments reflected the Board of Regents’ adoption of new principles regarding CEO compensation.
“Strong leadership is essential to the continued success of our institutions and the broader mission of advancing higher education in Kansas,” she said.
For more than six months, state university leaders expressed alarm about converging financial challenges that included general operational inflation, softness in student enrollment, loss of federal research funding and new financial obligations to college athletes.
In response, the Board of Regents approved tuition increases averaging 3.9% for in-state undergraduate university students. University administrators have moved to impose cost-cutting measures to deal with anticipated budget deficits.
Girod said the “challenges largely are due to external factors such as disruptions to federal funding, the lack of new state funding, rising costs associated with facilities construction and operations, and the projected nationwide decline in college enrollment.”
He said without decisive action KU’s Lawrence campus could wind up with a $4 million shortfall by the end of the fiscal year.
“The reality is higher education is at a crossroads, and universities must develop new financial models for the new world we are in,” Girod said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Carl-Ice-regents-chairman-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

June 13, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Kentucky has a measles outbreak, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced Monday. 
It started in Woodford County and spread to nearby Fayette, the cabinet said days after announcing four new cases of the highly contagious virus in unvaccinated people. 
“When there are measles outbreaks in other states and nearby countries, it is not surprising to see spread to Kentucky,” Dr. Steven Stack, the public health commissioner and newly-appointed cabinet secretary, said in a statement. “Measles can be very serious, but it is avoidable through vaccination. We urge all parents to have their children vaccinated to ensure they are protected from preventable diseases like measles.” 
Measles is extremely contagious and is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. 
Despite this, vaccinations have declined recently. 
“Results from the most recent school immunizations survey for the 2024-2025 school year indicate that only 86.9% of Kentucky kindergarteners are fully vaccinated against measles, which is lower than the national average of 93%. Two doses of MMR vaccine are required for school attendance in Kentucky,” the cabinet said. 
Meanwhile, the United States is facing its “largest outbreak” of measles since it “was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000,” the cabinet said.  
An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases, according to the CDC. 
As of June 24, 37 jurisdictions reported 1,227 confirmed measles cases to the CDC. 
In Kentucky, “health officials are working to identify people who may have been exposed,” the cabinet said. “There are currently five measles cases in Kentucky, four of which are connected to the same outbreak.” 
So far in 2025, the state has reported these measles cases:

In February, an adult was diagnosed with measles after traveling internationally. This was the first case in a Kentuckian since 2023. 
In March, an unvaccinated child traveling through Kentucky had measles. The child was treated and did not expose others. 
On June 27, the cabinet reported four new cases of measles in unvaccinated Kentuckians. Three of the four cases were from the same household in Woodford County. The fourth, unrelated to the others, is a Todd County person who was exposed while traveling internationally. 
On June 30, the cabinet announced that the “measles outbreak that started in Woodford County has spread to Fayette County.”

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana will get $412,000 in grant funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to remove lead pipes for schools and childcare facilities across the state.
The EPA announced in June that Louisiana is one of the states set to receive part of the $26 million dollars earmarked to replace lead pipes that can lead to a variety of health problems.
“More schools will be able to identify sources of lead in their water and take action,” said EPA administrator Lee Zeldin in a press release on June 13th. 
About 9 million water service lines in the country— the pipes that carry water from a public facility to houses, schools and businesses— have lead in their pipes, according to the most recent estimate from the EPA. Just over 140,000 of Louisiana’s service lines are estimated to have lead, along with the unknown status of 268,000 other service lines. 
Old pipes that contain lead can corrode over time depending on the chemistry of the water running through, eventually leading to the leaching of lead into drinking water.
Lead poisoning can be especially harmful to children. Even low levels of lead in the blood can cause serious health problems such as neurological problems, growth stunts and behavioral issues, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control. 
The CDC also cites children under 6 years old as especially vulnerable to these health hazards. Their bodies are in a phase of rapid development that could be particularly impacted by lead poisoning. Young children also have a tendency to put their hands in their mouths after grabbing items that may have lead, like old paint chips. 
Established by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law amended the 2016 voluntary lead contamination testing program for schools and childcare facilities to include funding to actually remove and replace sources of lead in drinking water.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8665-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

(Provided/Tri-County Technical College) COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s technical schools have more money to hire faculty and offer new classes as the state seeks to grow the number of high school juniors and seniors simultaneously enrolled in college courses.
Dual enrollment has grown to some 19,000 South Carolina high school students in the state since it started 20 years ago. SC Technical College System President Tim Hardee told the SC Daily Gazette he’d like to see that number rise to 25,000 within the next decade.
To spur the program along, legislators added $3 million annually (out of $5 million the technical system requested) to the new budget that starts Tuesday. That’s on top of the $10 million more annually added to the college system’s general operating budget, Hardee said.
The new funding will be split among South Carolina’s 16 technical colleges.
“There’s a market there, in partnership with the K-12 school districts, for us to grow our dual enrollment,” Hardee said. “That obviously won’t happen overnight, but we feel like the Legislature has invested in our technical colleges.”
High school students from both public and private schools can enroll in college classes which also count toward their high school diploma. This gives them a head start on an associate’s degree for in-demand fields, such as health care, manufacturing or welding. Or they can work ahead on freshman-level general education courses for those planning to attend a four-year university, often entering with a semester or more worth of college credit under their belt before ever stepping foot on campus.
More than 75% of these students receive scholarships to cover the cost of tuition. And at about half of the state’s 16 technical colleges, nearby K-12 school districts also pay for the textbooks students will need to complete the course, making it completely free, Hardee said.
Compare that to more than $27,000 annually for tuition, room and board at Clemson University, South Carolina’s most expensive public college, for South Carolina graduates before any scholarship aid, according to data from the state Commission on Higher Education. The in-state costs for Winthrop University and College of Charleston are both above $25,000. And at the University of South Carolina, it’s more than $24,000.
Dual enrollment courses help get students into the workforce faster or at least make a bachelor’s degree more affordable.
“Beyond just the financial affordability, it gives students an opportunity to experience a college course in a small classroom setting and really helps them to understand that they can be successful in college,” Hardee said.
Still, while 18% of the technical colleges’ student body are dual-enrolled high schoolers, the state is below the national average of 20%.
“We hope to be able to say, statewide, that dual enrollment courses are available for high school students with no cost to parents and their students,” Hardee previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
The best way to do that, Hardee said, is not to grow class sizes but to offer a wider range of classes.
Nearly 109,000 juniors and seniors attended South Carolina’s public high schools this past school year, according to the latest figures from the state Department of Education. About one-sixth of them are taking classes at the state’s technical colleges.
Trident Technical College has the largest number of dual-enrolled students — about 3,200. While the smallest program, Williamsburg Technical College, has just shy of 300 students. The 16 schools combined offer more than 850 courses.
The colleges will split the funds based on their total enrollment, Hardee said. The formula is weighted, however, to award more on a per pupil basis to rural colleges where it costs more per student to teach. Those colleges located in rural areas with a smaller tax base also tend to have less financial support from the counties and school districts they serve.
In those districts where students’ expenses aren’t totally covered, the technical colleges may choose to use their share of the state money to fill in the gap.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/students-at-tech.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

But she's faced criticism for CT's high electric costs and for deleted text messages.","Gov. Ned Lamont gave the state’s top utilities regulator, Marissa Gillett, another two years at the helm of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority on Monday, despite recent criticism over her transparency and Connecticut’s high electric costs. 
Gillett, 38, has led PURA since 2019 when she was chosen by Lamont. She previously worked as an advisor to the Maryland Public Service Commission and for an energy storage trade association.
Over the last few years, Gillett has developed an increasingly fraught relationship with the state’s two largest utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid, each of which own both electric and gas operations in Connecticut. Utility executives have accused Gillett of wielding excessive control over cases before regulators, and of making decisions that undermine the companies’ financial health and access to capital.
In April, Gillett’s nomination to a second, 4-year term as a member of PURA’s board was confirmed by lawmakers over the opposition of most Republicans. Her separate appointment as chair, however, is not subject to legislative review.
Lamont has consistently defended Gillett’s approach while singling out her background as a regulator, engineer and attorney who is willing to butt heads with the utilities.
“The utilities sometimes think she’s a little strong-willed, I understand that,” Lamont told reporters Monday, noting the companies have several pending lawsuits against Gillett and PURA.
“Let’s get this behind us so we can start working collaboratively,” the governor said.
In one of those lawsuits, brought by two gas companies owned by Avangrid, Gillett’s communications with two lawmakers who penned an op-ed harshly criticizing the utilities has become a point of contention. If Gillett helped to write the piece, the companies argue, it would reveal a bias that should have prevented her from ruling in cases that resulted in regulators cutting Avangrid’s gas rates by roughly $35 million.
Last week, an attorney for Gillett admitted in court that the chairwoman’s personal phone had automatically been set to delete text messages. That included messages with one of the authors of the op-ed.
Both Gillett and the authors of the op-ed have denied that she was involved in writing or editing the piece. A judge last week said he would allow attorneys for the utilities to question Gillett and her chief of staff under oath over whether she played any role in its creation.
In a statement released through a spokesperson Monday, Gillett said she was grateful to the governor for his continued support. 
“I look forward to working with my colleagues and the incredible PURA staff in furtherance of the important duties of the Authority,” Gillett said. 
Gillett’s critics, meanwhile, have latched on to the issue of her text messages to argue that she lacks transparency and has created needless controversies, all while electric rates in Connecticut remain some of the highest in the nation. House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, panned the governor’s decision after he previously called for Gillett to resign.
“The Governor’s decision to reappoint Marissa Gillett as PURA Chair is as baffling as it is predictable,” Candelora said in statement. “She misled legislators and the public — and even deleted records subject to Freedom of Information laws. That alone should prompt bipartisan outrage and a hearing before the very legislators who confirmed her nomination.” 
In a statement Monday, Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said, “Our expectations are for a fair, transparent, balanced and lawful regulatory environment, regardless of who serves.”
“We value strong, impartial regulation for the benefit of customers who rely on us for their electricity, heat, and water to be delivered safely and reliably,” Ratliff continued. “We are ready to work with partners in a constructive fashion to deliver cost-effective solutions for customers to provide them with stable bills and strong customer service.”
A spokesperson for Avangrid, which owns the electric utility United Illuminating, did not immediately comment on Lamont’s appointment Monday.
When asked whether he had any concerns regarding Gillett’s deletion of text messages, Lamont said he would wait for the matter to be adjudicated in the courts. Still, he said he would urge the chairwoman to be “fully transparent,” and offered another bit of public advice.
“Stay away from the press,” he said. “Stay away from those type of ways that people can say, ‘Oh, my God, you have a point of view one way or the other.’ Everybody in life has a point of view, I can’t deny that, but I don’t think you should be doing that in the press.”
Lamont said he is also close to making a decision on other appointments he has promised to make in order to fill current and possible future vacancies on PURA’s five-member board. Those picks would go before the General Assembly for confirmation. 
While declining to say who, exactly, he was considering, Lamont noted that Republican former lawmaker Holly Cheeseman of East Lyme has “a big following.” Lamont had previously promised to nominate Cheeseman earlier this year as part of a deal to ease Gillett’s confirmation. 
Lamont said that he would like to have his picks vetted and announced in time for them to be confirmed when lawmakers meet later this year in a special session, potentially in September.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_105-2025_0630-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 16:11:51.267990

Washington remains one of the 12 states and the District of Columbia who are home to more adults who oppose rather than favor Christian prayer in schools. More specifically, 61% of adults oppose allowing teachers to lead their classes in prayer that refer to Jesus with 37% in favor. Included in this list are California, Oregon, District of Columbia and much of New England.
Idaho is listed as one of 16 states populated by adults who are divided over prayers said by public school teachers that mention Jesus. The analysis found 44% opposing this kind of prayer in public schools with 55% who support it. Pew Research Center said this was not significant enough of a difference to place it in either category, factoring in the margin of error. States included alongside Idaho as divided are Montana, Arizona, New Mexico, Maine and Virginia.
The analysis — which came out of the Pew Research Religious Landscape Study published in February 2025 — went deeper and sought to answer what the percentages would be if the prayer in public school was more generic to “God” rather than to “Jesus.”
“Nationwide, a slightly larger share of Americans say they favor allowing teacher-led prayers referencing God (57%) than favor allowing teacher-led prayers specifically referencing Jesus (52%),” wrote Chip Rotolo in the June 23 Pew analysis.
Washington adults came significantly closer to the middle with this question with 41% still opposing prayer (compared to 61% opposing prayer with Jesus’ name) in public schools with 56% supporting them (compared to 37%).
This change may be owed to the religious life of non-Christian faiths in Washington. On the national level, when Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu adults were asked the question of teachers leading their classes in prayer to God but not a specific religion, the statistics in favor went up. While they didn’t go up significantly for Jewish adults (26% from 11%) and Buddhists (37% from 27%), the increase went to more than half in favor of prayer in school for Muslims (55% from 23%) and Hindus (56% from 31%).
When asked about generic prayers in public school, Idaho adults did not move the needle too drastically. However, they did move their state from the divided category into the in favor one,  with 58% adults in favor of prayer in public school (from 55%) and 41% opposed (from 44%).

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
What the end of the ‘roadless rule’ could mean for Utah’s national forests

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
Western states’ budgets, industries rely on federal lands. So does wildlife.

“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.













The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers





“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Don Bacon, R-Neb., is not running in 2026. Now it's a mad dash for both parties to fill an open seat in the midterms","Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon announce he's not seeking re-election at Eppley Airfield in Omaha on Jun 30. 2025.  (Aaron sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — It’s official. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is not running in 2026. 
The retired Air Force brigadier general announced his retirement from the House to a group of local reporters Monday, confirming leaks that emerged late last week in Washington, D.C., and Omaha, that his fifth term representing the Omaha area in the U.S. House would be his last.
“I hope to be remembered for … I’m a Christian, first … American, second … somewhere down here being a Republican,” Bacon told reporters. “It’s about doing the right thing … I’m a traditional conservative at heart.”
Infrastructure vote
Bacon held his announcement at under-construction Eppley Airfield, a backdrop he chose partly because he might have to fly back to Washington, D.C. for a vote on Trump mega-bill, and partly to highlight his pivotal vote helping pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which put him at odds with President Donald Trump.
Bacon touted his ability to pass 38 bills during his time in Congress and his willingness to work across the aisle.

Trump had tried and failed to get Congress to pass a similar bill while he was president the first time. He then tried to torpedo the bill when Congress had enough votes to pass it under President Joe Biden. Trump, after the vote, criticized Bacon publicly during a May 2022 visit to Nebraska, calling him “bad news.” His political team worked for years to recruit potential GOP primary challengers.
But Bacon kept winning and continued to publicly spar with Trump. He is one of a few House Republicans left who represents a true swing district. Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District backed Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Biden in 2020, and Trump in 2016.
Still, Bacon has proven a reliable Republican vote, often after receiving pressure from Trump and what he calls “reassurances” from House GOP  leadership that some of his concerns about proposals will be addressed.
Choosing batttles
Bacon told reporters Monday that he learned to “pick and choose” his battles. 
“If you’ve never fallen on your sword, there’s something wrong with you,” Bacon said. “If you fall on your sword every day, there’s something wrong with you.”
Several Nebraska Republican elected officials thanked Bacon for his congressional service. U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer said Bacon had “faithfully served our country and the people of Nebraska.” 
“I have enjoyed working alongside Don on many issues facing our nation, and I will miss partnering with him on solutions that strengthen our Nebraska communities,” said Fischer, who often calls Bacon by his Air Force call sign, “Bits.”
Many of Bacon’s critics have described the distance between his words and actions as hypocrisy. He has defended his record as one that shows independence and pragmatism. 
The House Majority PAC, an important political arm of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, issued a statement saying Bacon was running away. 
“After voting to gut health care and jack up costs for working families, Don Bacon is headed for the hills because he knows he can’t win,” the statement said.
No more two-year cycles

Bacon said he could win re-election, but said it’s time for “a new Republican” to hold the seat, one with the energy to handle the long days and year-round combination of constituent work and campaigning a swing district requires. 
Bacon says he sees himself as a “Reagan Republican.” He explains that as someone who does not give in to the impulses of isolationism or the temptations of assuming American military power endures without investment.  Local Republicans sometimes grew frustrated with Bacon. Some protested his office during fights over who should replace Bacon’s friend Kevin McCarthy as House speaker. He opposed populist U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.
The Nebraska Republican Party targeted Bacon after a Trump-focused leadership change in 2022. Bacon at times reminded his critics that in 2020 and 2024, in the 2nd District, he secured more votes than Trump. 
“I want to be a voice for traditional Republican views,” Bacon said Monday. 
Voters in a mixed district with a slight GOP lean after the most recent redistricting rarely punished Bacon for talking like a moderate and voting with conservatives. The 2nd District includes all of urban Douglas County and rural Saunders County and parts of western suburban Sarpy County.
Candidates lining up
Local conservatives, including Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding, former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei, have been discussed as potential  GOP primary contenders. Political observers expect one or more to join the race as early as this week, now that Bacon has announced. 
Harding issued a statement on social media after Bacon’s announcement, congratulating him on his retirement from Congress. He called Bacon a “true statesman.”
“Don has been a true servant leader for our community,” Lindstrom said.  
Already a group of Democrats is jockeying for the nomination. Omaha political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and State Sen. John Cavanaugh have announced bids. A third potential candidate, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades has said she is considering a House bid.
Also running are Democrats Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis.
Bacon rose to local prominence in the Air Force. He honed cyber expertise as some weapons of war shifted from bombs to keystrokes. He led the 55th Wing at Nebraska’s Offutt Air Force Base. But in local and national GOP circles he was known as the swing Republican who kept winning. He beat the last Democrat to serve the 2nd District, the late U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford.
He survived the “blue wave” of 2018 by beating progressive nonprofit executive Kara Eastman and beat her again in 2020. Then he twice defeated State Sen. Tony Vargas of South Omaha.
Bacon said he was unsure what he would do next, but added he liked leading and executive work, whether that in the private sector or another elected role, remains to be seen.  
“I look forward to being part of this community and expanding our friendships, Bacon said. “I am grateful to those who voted for me, and those who didn’t vote for me. I appreciate the opportunity to serve.” 
Not yet done
Bacon stressed on Monday that he is not done in the House, nor does he expect to coast to retirement. This week, he once again finds himself in a position to cast a potentially pivotal vote for a mega-bill at the heart of Trump’s domestic agenda. He reemphasized some of his concerns about the Senate version of the bill’s proposed cuts to Medicaid, but also highlighted the Trump tax cuts as a positive.
“Are we better off keeping the tax cuts permanent, keeping the inheritance tax off, keeping the investment tax credits on, and the things that we’re going to do for our military in this bill?” Bacon asked. “There’s a lot of great stuff in this legislation too.” 
Angie Bacon, after the news conference, said she was looking forward to spending more time with her husband. She said she had a list of chores for him to do around the house, starting with just being home.
She said the hardest part of serving — for a member of Congress and family, is being “willing to let them serve and sacrifice your time with them.”

(Provided/SC Department of Public Safety)COLUMBIA — Take a good look at the extra Highway Patrol cruisers on South Carolina’s roads for the Fourth of July, because the state’s public safety department wants to know whether they’re the best in the country.
For the 11th year in a row, the Department of Public Safety is vying for a spot on the American Association of State Troopers’ annual calendar of best-looking cruisers, which features the 13 state cruisers with the most votes. The Palmetto State has never appeared in the calendar, thought it came close in 2023, when its then-new Mustang cruiser landed in 14th place.
Anyone who doesn’t know what the cruisers look like can get a good look this weekend. As for previous holidays, the state Highway Patrol will have extra officers patrolling the roads, starting at 6 p.m. Thursday ahead of Independence Day through midnight Sunday, said spokesman Kyle McGahee. The extra cruisers will be monitoring for drunken drivers and other hazardous driving as more people take to the roads for the holiday, he said.
Alongside the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Natural Resources will increase the number of officers patrolling waterways for people boating under the influence and use planes to patrol state highways.
If those cruisers impress, people can vote on the association’s website. This year, Highway Patrol submitted a photo of one of its 2023 Mustangs alongside a 2024 F-150 truck. The truck was one of 35 the department started rolling out last year, replacing some of its older Dodge Chargers.
Voting for the 2026 calendar is open until 5 p.m. July 11. A person can vote once per device, meaning a single person can vote from both a laptop and a smartphone, according to the agency.
Calendars sold for $10 each last year. Proceeds from those sales go toward the American Association of State Troopers Foundation, which gives educational scholarships to troopers’ children nationwide.

(Courtesy of U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Alexx Mercer) New Mexico’s claims against Cannon Air Force Base for environmental and public health damage from so-called “forever chemicals” in groundwater will move to the forefront of a sprawling lawsuit.
New Mexico is part of multi-state litigation in North Carolina, which includes a combined 10,000-plus cases from across the country seeking damages from fire-fighting foam containing per-and-poly fluorinated alkyl substances — PFAS — at civilian and military sites.
A North Carolina-based federal judge gave the nod last week for New Mexico to proceed with its efforts to seek compensation from the federal government, which operates Cannon, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), often nicknamed the Superfund law, an environmental department news release stated Friday.
Out of more than 500 cases in the court, New Mexico’s will act as a test for how others will be decided, New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney told Source NM.
“New Mexico’s case was selected as a bellwether case to move forward within the multistrict litigation,” Kenney said. “So essentially, little trials are going to start happening in the South Carolina federal court; they’re going to be indicative of how large numbers of cases will proceed.”
If the judge determines Cannon had responsibility for contamination under Superfund law, the federal government will be required to compensate the state for ongoing cleanup, restoration or replacement of groundwater. The damages are being pursued through the New Mexico Office of Natural Resources Trustee, and would require clean up to “prepollution standards.”
“Everything is at stake for us in this multidistrict litigation,” Kenney said.
The outcome of the case could impact settlement negotiations with the federal government and manufacturers of the chemicals, according to the news release.
“For too long, the federal government has ignored its responsibility to clean up the toxic legacy it left behind in communities like Clovis,” Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “This case gives us the opportunity to establish once and for all that the United States can and will be held accountable for poisoning our water, harming our residents, and threatening our agricultural economy. We are proud to lead this fight — not just for New Mexico, but for every community impacted by PFAS contamination.”
New Mexico files new lawsuit against US Air Force over PFAS contamination

New Mexico’s reckoning with PFAS stretches back years.
Contamination from areas surrounding military bases infiltrated nearby dairy cows in Clovis, resulting in the euthanasia and disposal of more than 3,000 cows in October 2022. Recent studies found the plants and animals at Holloman Lake outside of Alamogordo contain the highest levels of measured PFAS in the world.
New Mexico joined multi-state litigation in North Carolina in 2019, but updated its lawsuit in 2024 requesting a judge to award monetary damages and compel cleanup across five military sites in New Mexico. So far, only the claims against Cannon are moving forward.
The State of New Mexico is embroiled in separate litigation in Denver federal appeals courts, after the Department of Defense sued the state, claiming it overstepped its authority it manding cleanup.
The development in the multi-state litigation comes as the state filed a new lawsuit last week against the U.S. Department of Defense in state district court. In contrast to the multi-state litigation, the damages available in state courts require cleanup to a lower standard, Kenney said.
“Regulatory standards don’t always get you the full remediation,” Kenney said. “Our state court claims and our multidistrict claims all around Cannon achieve different outcomes, but we want them all to proceed.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)We believe our families are worth fighting for and so is our future. That’s why our organizations came together this legislative session to insist that state lawmakers invest in all of us — the people of Washington state.
We, along with so many advocates and everyday people, reminded lawmakers they faced a false choice. Responsibly dealing with a budget deficit didn’t have to mean cutting funding from early learning and public schools, health care and support for people with disabilities, affordable housing programs and the jobs of state employees. 
Lawmakers could have made a different, better choice: find new sources of revenue that fund the programs and services people rely on. We insisted that legislators work to balance our state’s upside-down tax code — one that already favors the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations at the expense of everyone else. Spoiler alert: They did a bit of both.
Our tax code can only be described as upside-down and rigged to benefit those with the most. 
For almost 100 years, our tax code has relied heavily on three main revenue sources – sales tax, property tax, and business and occupation tax – that make for an antiquated structure that doesn’t reflect today’s economic realities. 
Our tax code asks those with the least to pay the highest percent of their income in state and local taxes. Working families are taxed at a rate up to six times higher than the wealthiest in our state. Even after the passage of the capital gains tax on the ultra-wealthy in 2021, our state tax code is still rated second to last in the country when it comes to tax fairness.
Simply put: Revenue collected into our state coffers can’t keep up with our real needs. From a growing population to increasing demands for state services to the effects of inflation, it costs more every year to meet the needs of Washingtonians. As a result, legislators face structural budget challenges year after year. While legislators this year turned to new and higher taxes to fill roughly $9 billion of a budget hole estimated to be $12 billion or more, they’ll have to solve the same problem again in the future.
Legislators started the session bolstered by an electorate that voted overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining the capital gains tax they passed in 2021. They proposed bold new progressive revenue measures that would have avoided cuts to vital programs and helped permanently address the structural budget issues that perennially plague state budget writers.
On the progressive revenue menu this year were new ideas like taxing Tesla and other electric car manufacturers who sell their excess zero-emission vehicle credits for huge profits. Lawmakers ultimately picked some low-hanging fruit. They closed tax loopholes, taxed synthetic nicotine products, extended sales tax to IT services, and raised taxes on alcohol.
Legislators also relied on more conventional – and popular – taxes like making the capital gains tax even more progressive by raising the rate for profits over $1 million. Lawmakers raised business and occupation taxes, adding surcharges for the most profitable corporations like financial institutions and advanced computing businesses.
Regrettably, some of the best ideas to pump the brakes on wealth inequality did not pass. The High-Earner Tax on Employers, which would have ensured our state’s largest businesses do their part, and a Financial Intangibles Tax on the ultra-wealthy did not survive. These policies would have raised the most revenue, made our tax code more equitable, and prevented cuts to vital services.
Still, we applauded legislative leaders and rank-and-file members alike for their work to save programs that working families depend on. Unfortunately, that turned to a slow clap as we watched a few of the state’s biggest businesses pick off key votes with their multi-million-dollar lobbying campaign. We wish the new governor had provided a clearer vision and direction to prevent harmful budget cuts.
In the end, legislators were forced to slash some services because they knew the governor would only approve a limited scope of revenue bills. They eliminated a program to support foster youth and delayed implementation of several programs, including early learning for kids from low-income households. They also made the biggest cut to abortion access funding in state history.
Our organizations are in this for the long haul, fighting for a Washington where everyone belongs and can thrive. We showed up in Olympia this session as parents, seniors, teachers, caregivers, and state employees, and thousands of us rallied, wrote letters, signed in, and testified in support of revenue over cuts.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)SHEPHERDSVILLE — With a third Republican candidate entering the race for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat next year, the jockeying for President Donald Trump’s backing is on. 
While neither Trump nor longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell will be on Kentucky’s ballot in 2026, their presences loom large over the next election cycle in the Bluegrass state. 
Nate Morris, a Lexington businessman, appeared before a crowd of more than 1,200 with Turning Point USA founder and conservative media personality Charlie Kirk in the Bullitt County seat Monday morning. Morris announced his candidacy last week on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast. 
Morris, along with Republicans U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, are hoping to succeed McConnell, who announced he would not seek reelection earlier this year. McConnell’s rise to power in 1984 ushered in the Republican Party of Kentucky’s rise to political dominance in the commonwealth. However, McConnell has lost voters’ approval in recent years.

Morris hopes to court Republican voters who are unhappy with McConnell’s tenure. During the Monday rally, Morris called on the Republican Party of Kentucky to deny McConnell a lifetime achievement award.
Morris also took issue with a letter from the state Republican party to candidates ahead of the annual Lincoln Day Dinner set for August. Morris said the letter asked candidates to not “speak ill of Republicans that are not running for office.” That would include McConnell, who Morris added is set to receive a lifetime achievement award during the dinner.
“I am calling on the Republican Party of Kentucky to rescind the lifetime achievement award for Mitch McConnell,” Morris said to applause from the crowd. “And I’m asking the other two guys in the race, Daniel Cameron and Andy Barr, to do the same thing. And if they won’t, I want to hear why.”
Morris dropped his first TV ad Friday morning, saying he is “here to take out the trash,” including McConnell’s. Morris, who rides a garbage truck and picks up trash in the ad, founded waste and recycling company Rubicon. 
After the rally, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Kentucky told the Kentucky Lantern that the letter “was simply a request — not an attempt to police candidates’ speech.” Political parties often do not back candidates until a nominee is chosen for a general election. 
Kirk throughout the rally criticized McConnell, particularly for not backing Trump in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. McConnell, as the Senate Republican leader, later called the event “a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election.” McConnell disputed Trump’s claims that he won the 2020 election and has been an opponent of U.S. isolationism and a  strong supporter of Ukraine in its war with Russia, in contrast to Trump on the campaign trail last year. McConnell also voted against confirming Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump has criticized McConnell multiple times over the years, even though McConnell played a key role in confirming the Supreme Court justices who have been upholding some of Trump’s controversial actions. 
“He’s willing to actually call out the McConnell mafia that have been running this state for so long,” Kirk said of Morris. 
The Republican candidates have been trying to distance themselves from McConnell in hopes that a Trump endorsement in Kentucky — a state that the president has carried since the 2016 election — would bring the seal of approval from the state’s GOP voters. 
  Kentucky’s U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie was one of two Republicans to vote against the spending and tax package that President Donald Trump was urging the House to pass. The House approved the bill 215-214 early Thursday morning. In March, Massie spoke to reporters after casting the sole Republican vote against a bill that averted a government shutdown.

Meanwhile, Trump has his eyes on another Bluegrass Republican — U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of the 4th Congressional District. In recent weeks, Massie has become a thorn in the president’s side, by opposing Trump’s domestic policy bill and criticizing the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Trump’s political allies have launched a PAC to wage a primary war against the Northern Kentucky congressman, starting with a $1 million ad buy. 
When asked about Trump’s involvement in Massie’s primary after his own rally, Morris said Republicans have “to stand with the president, period.” 
“We got to get along as a party,” Morris said. “We’ve got the political winds at our back, and we’ve got to use this momentum to get stuff done and get the agenda done that the people of Kentucky voted for.”
State Rep. T.J Roberts, R-Burlington, said before Morris’ rally that “Thomas Massie has my complete and total endorsement.” Roberts, who was elected to the state House in 2024, has close ties to the congressman. 
“He really represented MAGA before MAGA was even a thing,” Roberts said of Massie. “He has consistently worked to fulfill President Trump’s agenda, and I really hope that the two can get back to working together. I stand with President Trump, I stand with Congressman Massie, and I don’t think it’s difficult to stand with both.”

On the U.S. Senate race, Roberts said he views the election as a chance to allow the Kentucky GOP to “choose its new path forward.” Roberts said that he doesn’t think “it’s truly possible to move past someone who really built the infrastructure,” like McConnell, but today’s Republicans are more conservative than they have been in recent decades. Roberts, one of the young members of the state legislature, added that his generation has been impacted by a growing national debt and inflation as the result of a government that “has consistently ignored the young.” 
“Yeah, we’re absolutely moving on, and it’s time to make sure that young Americans get their representation in Washington, D.C., get their representation in Frankfort,” Roberts said. “I think my election was a show of that, and I think 2026 is going to be a show of that, too.” 
Another GOP state lawmaker, Rep. Josh Calloway, of Irvington, said that he is “excited about a once in a 40-year opportunity” with the open U.S. Senate seat for Republican voters. The result could have implications not just for Kentucky, but the nation as a whole. 
“People are flocking in here,” Calloway said as attendees looked for seats before the rally. “Charlie Kirk is here. And yeah, things have changed in Kentucky to some degree.” 
Morris doubts that his McConnell bashing will turn away Kentucky Republicans or hurt his campaign.
“Look, I think that the numbers speak for themselves. I’ve seen them,” Morris told reporters. “Mitch McConnell is one of the least popular politicians in the history of America, and I think here in Kentucky, I don’t think it’s any different.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4414-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

Plagued by major differences over issues like tax policy and pay for teachers and state employees, House and Senate Republicans were unable to reach agreement before commencing their summer break and so the state will continue to limp along on the old budget for the time being.
Republicans did however find common ground on several conservative culture war priorities like weakening gun laws, banning diversity, equity and inclusion, and targeting the rights of transgender people and immigrants, and this past week, NC Newsline caught up with Wake County State Senator Lisa Grafstein to learn more.

(Getty Images)I worked underground in the mines for 20 years, starting in 1977. Then I spent almost two more decades fighting for the safety and health of coal miners in the U.S. and around the world. I’ve seen a lot of hardship in this line of work. But nothing grinds a man down like black lung. It steals your breath, your strength and your ability to work — slowly and cruelly.
That’s why I am speaking out against the cuts to Medicaid in what they’re calling the One Big Beautiful Bill that the Senate will be voting on soon. That bill will hurt us in two big ways.
First, the bill imposes new “work requirements” to receive Medicaid. This may sound reasonable on paper but, here in West Virginia, it will do real harm. Miners with black lung disease are very sick, for very long, before they get “approved” as having a disability and are able to receive benefits. The company doctors make it so hard to qualify that I have known many people who have died before they got their benefits. It takes an average of seven years for a miner to get a final decision on his black lung claim. Seven years.
During that time, the miner usually can’t get disability benefits, because the system hasn’t classified him as being sick. But it is also damn hard for him to work, because it is damn hard for him to breathe. What keeps those men alive — and sometimes their wives, kids, and grandkids — is Medicaid. It covers their oxygen, their inhalers, and their hospital visits. It keeps people alive. It helps entire coal communities.
But under the new process in the One Big Beautiful Bill, getting and keeping Medicaid will get tangled up in red tape. People would be required to report their work each month to keep their health care. It they don’t submit the paperwork on time, if they get confused by the online portal, if they miss a deadline — they lose their health care.  
Miners are awesome, competent people. But many older miners do not have Internet access. Some never finished school. These are proud, working men, but filling out government forms online every month is not something they were trained for.
And if they lose coverage because of a mistake in reporting? They’ll get sicker. They will end up in the emergency room — or suffer in silence at home. Some people might say that miners won’t have to comply with these requirements. But that’s not at all clear. And what kind of paperwork will be required to be exempted? How long will that take? There are too many unanswered questions. The only thing that is clear is that these men will lose coverage and their health will be jeopardized even more.
The second big problem with the One Big Beautiful Bill affects all of us. Rural hospitals and clinics depend on Medicaid. In much of West Virginia, Medicaid provides the backbone of our health care system. These cuts to Medicaid will close more clinics, close rural hospitals and leave many of us having to travel miles to get even emergency health care.  
I am proud to have spent my life fighting for the health and safety of coal miners. In coal country, we know what it means to sacrifice your health for your job.  We should honor that sacrifice — not make people jump through more hoops to prove they are worthy of health care.  
If these cuts to Medicaid go through, more miners will die waiting for treatment. More of our clinics and hospitals will close their doors. And all West Virginians will suffer.

(Getty Images)I returned home to the United States from Scotland in March of 2020 with my master’s degree and a lump in my breast I had yet to discover.
The next day, the world started to shut down from COVID-19. Three weeks later, I discovered that lump and my cancer journey unofficially started. On my 34th birthday I underwent an MRI, got my diagnosis and it became official. My world suddenly looked nothing like it did a few weeks earlier when I boarded that airplane.
As a student, I was covered by Scotland’s national plan and had yet to get settled with a plan back home. When I was diagnosed, hospital staff helped me apply for Medicaid. I was worried people would look down on me. 
Some people think not having insurance all ties back to not having a job. That is one of the reasons a person might have Medicaid coverage, but it covers so many others as well, including seasonal workers in tourism, like me, commercial fishing and energy as well as children, women who are single moms and folks in nursing homes. More than half of Alaska employers do not provide benefits as part of work compensation. 
I think of all the times people are out of work, like I was, through no fault of their own. It’s not laziness or lack of ability, but simple timing. My husband is a doctor and we spent a month without health care when he was moving from one job to another. There’s absolutely no reason someone should risk death because they’re between jobs. 
All my doctors and other medical staff took great care of me, and the treatments and technology they used to beat back — and ultimately defeat — my disease would not have been possible had financial barriers been in place, even partially.
Access to Medicaid may well have saved my life, and it certainly has saved the lives of others. Having access to Medicaid allowed me to make decisions about my treatment without worrying about cost, debt, or financial ruin. A cancer diagnosis is enough to worry about, without wondering which treatments you can afford without potential bankruptcy. That’s a dark choice and not one anybody should have forced upon them by something like a cancer diagnosis.
Six years later it saddens me to think this program could soon be unavailable to other folks in my situation. The proposed cuts to the federal Medicaid program could put significant limitations on what we in Alaska call Denali Care and Denali KidCare. If passed, the “Big, Beautiful Bill” could make it so that health care coverage will be financially out of reach for many, including seasonal workers like myself. As a sea kayak guide, I do not have benefits through work but am fortunate enough to be insured through my husband’s employment.
The bill’s $1.1 tillion in Medicaid cuts will remove coverage from more than 25,000 in our state, but the downstream effects will hurt far more folks than just those who currently access care through the program. New data from the University of Alaska Anchorage indicates an estimated 3,000 jobs will be lost and uncompensated care costs to Alaska hospitals will result in increased premiums for folks on private insurance plans, which will lead to fewer people being able to afford those and so, yet another wave of uninsured. Alaska will be one of the hardest states hit in percentage of jobs lost and the financial hit to our economy is estimated at more than $320 million annually.
The cost to our state will be staggering yet our federal lawmakers seem to be on board with it despite warning signs coming from all angles — health care providers, economists, business leaders and even the Alaska Legislature, which passed a resolution asking Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich to fight the bill on their behalf. 
I sometimes think that my cancer journey has been pretty “easy” compared to what some people go through. I did have three surgeries to get it properly removed, but I didn’t need chemo, and I had a great support system. 
But that’s the point, right? It’s cancer. No one ever really has it easy. And thankfully Medicaid is there to take away one aspect of it that could make everything so much harder.
If our lawmakers hear our voices above those of the other D.C. power brokers, they’ll know the best decision.
I hope Medicaid is there for those who need it for generations to come.

Utah and other states have pushed the federal government to hand over public lands, and a sweeping proposal in Congress could put millions of acres up for sale. (Photo by Spenser Heaps /Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.

“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.

“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.










The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers


“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress (Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline).HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding in fiscal year 2025, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)An 82-year-old woman has died from injuries she sustained during a firebombing attack in Boulder earlier this month, when a man targeted peaceful marchers who were calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. 
Karen Diamond died of severe injuries, according to a Monday statement from the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office. The office has identified 29 victims of the attack on the Pearl Street Mall, 13 of whom were physically injured.
“This horrific attack has now claimed the life of an innocent person who was beloved by her family and friends,” Michael Dougherty, the district attorney, said in the statement. “Our hearts are with the Diamond family during this incredibly difficult time. Our office will fight for justice for the victims, their loved ones, and the community.”

Dougherty added, “Part of what makes Colorado special is that people come together in response to a tragedy; I know that the community will continue to unite in supporting the Diamond family and all the victims of this attack.” 
Diamond was a participant in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, an organization that has led weekly walks in the city’s downtown area for nearly two years in support of the release of hostages taken by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. There are still 50 hostages in Hamas captivity, according to The Associated Press.
The suspect in the attack allegedly told police that he targeted the demonstration because he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.”
Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian citizen, has been charged as the suspect in the attack. He now faces first-degree murder charges, as well as federal hate crime charges and more than 100 state-level criminal charges. A preliminary hearing in the state case is set for July 15.

,DC,2025-06-30 18:13:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate kicks off vote-a-rama on massive tax and spending cut bill,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-kicks-vote-rama-massive-tax-and-spending-cut-bill,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate launched a marathon amendment voting session Monday during which lawmakers will debate dozens of proposals from Republicans and Democrats that could significantly reshape the “big, beautiful bill” even as a final vote nears.The vote-a-rama is expected to last throughout Monday and potentially into Tuesday, challenging senators who aren't accustomed to having to stay on the floor for all hours of the day and night. At the end, the Senate will vote on final passage and if the tax and spending cut bill is successful it will be taken up next in the House, possibly as soon as Wednesday morning.The first big debate and vote Monday centered around Republicans’ decision to use current policy instead of current law to determine the bill’s fiscal impacts.Congress has long used current law to determine how much legislation will add or subtract from annual deficits, especially when it comes to the budget reconciliation process that is being used for this bill.But since Republicans’ 2017 tax law was set to expire at the end of the year, using the current law baseline showed significantly higher deficits than using current policy — which could prove to be a political problem.The debate, wonky even for the Senate, could have ripple effects in the future, especially if Democrats ever get unified control of government and use the change in process that GOP lawmakers set this time around for their own policy goals.Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said during brief debate before the vote that using current policy would allow the GOP to make many of the tax levels in the 2017 law permanent, instead of having to sunset them to comply with reconciliation rules.“What I’m trying to do, and I’m very happy about it, is to make sure the tax cuts don’t expire 10 years from now,” Graham said.Reconciliation bills cannot increase the deficit after the 10-year budget window ends.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York spoke out against using current policy over current law, rebuking his Republican colleagues, though his arguments were ultimately unsuccessful. “Republicans are doing something the Senate has never done before — deploying fake math, accounting gimmicks to hide the true cost of the bill,” Schumer said. “Look, Republicans can use whatever budgetary gimmicks they want to try to make the math work on paper but you can’t paper over the real-life economic consequences of adding tens of trillions to the debt.”The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its current law score of the bill on Sunday, showing the legislation would add $3.253 trillion to deficits during the next decade.Senators voted 53-47 along party lines against overruling Graham’s decision to use current policy.Narrow majoritySenators spent the next few hours debating Democratic changes to the bill that would have addressed Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. But no Democratic proposals had been adopted as of Monday afternoon and Republicans had yet to start voting on their own amendments.Once both sides exhaust themselves, the Senate will move on to a final passage vote. With a narrow 53-seat majority, GOP leaders can only afford to lose three members and still have the bill pass with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.Two Republican senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky — already indicated they’ll oppose the bill when they voted against advancing it late Saturday night. Altering the bill could cause issues for other senators, making the entire process a headache for GOP leadership.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech that the core of the sweeping package is focused on avoiding a cliff created when Republicans approved lower tax rates during President Donald Trump’s first term.“This is about extending that tax relief so the same people that benefited from it back in 2017 and for the last eight years don’t end up having a colossal, massive tax increase hitting them in the face come January 1,” Thune said.Schumer sharply criticized the policy changes and spending cuts in the mega-bill, saying they would lead to fewer people being able to access safety-net programs, like Medicaid, which provides health insurance coverage for low-income people and some people with disabilities, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food assistance for low-income people.“How can any senator go home and tell their constituents, ‘I’m sorry, I took away your health care because I wanted to give tax breaks to billionaires?’” Schumer said. “And yet Republicans are dead set on walking off a cliff by passing a bill they know will be ruinous to their own constituents.”‘Wraparound amendment’Depending on how popular an amendment is and exactly what aspects of the legislation it seeks to change, it could increase or decrease the number of GOP senators willing to vote for the final version of the bill.Republican leaders will want to fend off all Democratic amendments, though if some do get added, Thune can use a procedural tactic called a “wraparound amendment” at the end to cut any problematic changes by wiping out Democratic amendments with a majority vote.In addition to providing an opportunity for senators to debate nitty gritty policy details, the vote-a-rama serves a political purpose for Democrats, who will try to get at-risk senators to take votes that can then be used during the midterm elections to try to sway voters. Those amendments will mostly focus on Maine’s Susan Collins after North Carolina’s Tillis announced his retirement Sunday.While Democrats have more incentive for so-called “gotcha amendments” since they’re trying to flip the Senate from red to blue, GOP leaders may also bring up amendments challenging vulnerable Democratic senators, like Georgia’s Jon Ossoff.And since the opportunity to put up as many amendments as a senator pleases is rare, both Democrats and Republicans may have an eye on purple-state lawmakers up for reelection in 2028.",,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

The attacks on trans people at the North Carolina legislature are clearly part of a coordinated national campaign from the political right that has also impacted a number of other institutions. This week marks the end of Pride Month and it’s clear that the anti-LGBTQ movement led by the Trump administration has managed to temper the support of some traditional Pride Month supporters in the corporate community.
That said, as NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield learned in a conversation with Equality North Carolina executive director Eliazar Posada, many other Pride supporters have stepped up their efforts and despite the actions of some companies and developments at the legislature, the energy, enthusiasm, activism and long-term optimism among equality supporters in North Caroline remains high and on the upswing.

The Iowa Board of Massage Therapy recently charged Phelan Hudson of Ames with failing to exercise the expected degree of care for practitioners, and with habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs.
According to the board, two separate complaints were filed against Hudson in 2023. During the subsequent investigation, the board says, it was determined that Hudson inappropriately draped a client in preparation for a massage and then “made physical contact with parts with the client’s body that were not typical of the client’s expectations.”
In addition, the board alleges that during its 2023 investigation, it was determined that in 2019, a year after he was first licensed by the board, another of Hudson’s clients had filed a complaint alleging Hudson had been falling asleep during a massage.
In response to that allegation, the board says, Hudson disclosed, in “full transparency,” that there was a strong possibility he was under the influence of drugs while at work and giving massages.
In order to resolve the case, Hudson recently agreed to surrender his license.
Other recent actions against state-licensed massage therapists include:
— Meifang Pan of Sioux City, who was the subject of a 2024 complaint to the board. The board alleges that during its investigation of the complaint, it was determined that Pan owned and operated Asian Herbal Massage at 3130 Floyd Boulevard in Sioux City where, in August 2023, local police investigated reports of prostitution and other illegal activity.
Court records indicate that an undercover officer was offered sex by an unlicensed massage therapist at Asian Herbal Massage, after which police seized $4,416 in cash from the business, as well as lubricants and condoms. The employee was charged with prostitution, according to court records and board documents, but the disposition of that case is unclear.
According to police, at least two other employees of Pan’s business were also offering massages without a valid license. Pan allegedly admitted she was aware her workers were not properly licensed and was charged with aiding and abetting, a serious misdemeanor. She later received a deferred judgment in the case, according to board records.
The board recently charged Pan with knowingly aiding, assisting, procuring, or advising a person to unlawfully practice as a massage therapist; permitting an unlicensed employee to perform massages; negligence in the practice of the profession; and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the profession.
To settle the case, Pan recently agreed to voluntarily surrender her license.
— Katisha Knight of Ames, who was charged with practicing massage at some undefined point between 2014 and 2025 while her license was on “inactive” status. The board alleges that in January 2025, it received three complaints against Knight related to allegations she was practicing massage therapy without an active license – which she allegedly admitted. She was then charged with representing herself as a massage therapist while her license was inactive, suspended or revoked.
To settle the charges against her, Knight recently agreed to pay a $300 civil penalty. Her license has been reactivated by the board.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/massage-getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 15:01:55.564690

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The United States Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a previous court’s decision to return Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case against Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline to state court. 
The Court’s decision comes months after arguments resumed in state court, where Judge James S. Jamo has yet to rule on motions from both the attorney general’s office and the Canadian energy company.
Nessel first filed her case aimed at shutting down the more than 70-year-old Line 5 in 2019, citing concerns that the dual pipelines in the Straits of Mackinac could rupture, resulting in a catastrophic oil spill in the waters where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet.

After more than a year of litigation, Enbridge filed a successful motion to have the matter heard in federal court. While Nessel filed a motion to return the case to state court, her initial request was denied. She was later granted interlocutory appeal, allowing a federal appeals court to determine the proper venue for the case before it was fully litigated in federal court. 
Nessel argued that Enbridge failed to abide by the 30-day deadline to request a move to federal court, filing their motion at the end of 2021. 
The Court of Appeals ultimately determined the matter belongs in state court, agreeing that the pipeline company had missed the deadline and later rejecting Enbridge’s request for a rehearing. 
In an email, Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company was encouraged that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Sixth Circuit’s decision, arguing it conflicts with two other federal courts of appeals decisions, which determined there are exceptions to the 30-day limit.
“The Supreme Court review will resolve this conflict in the courts of appeals,” Duffy said. 
He noted the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to review the matter would not impact the company’s other case against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Department of Natural Resources Director Scott Bowen, over the governor’s decision to revoke the company’s permit to operate Line 5 on the lakebed beneath the Straits of Mackinac.

In a recent study, researchers found more pediatric firearm deaths in states with looser gun laws (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images).More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

4-year-old son, Anh Hoang, who had received only the first of the measles vaccine’s two
doses. Nguyen took his family to a primary care clinic, where his son got his second shot.
He was surprised when his insurer did not cover the vaccine — and its $1,400 price tag.
(Scott Dalton for KFF Health News)In the early days of the West Texas measles outbreak, Thang Nguyen eyed the rising number of cases and worried. His 4-year-old son was at risk because he had received only the first of the vaccine’s two doses.
So, in mid-March, he took his family to a primary care clinic at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.
By the end of the visit, his son, Anh Hoang, had received one shot protecting against four illnesses — measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. He also received a second shot against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough, as well as a flu shot. His twin daughters, who had already had their measles vaccinations, got other immunizations.
Nguyen, who is a UTMB postdoctoral fellow in public health and infectious disease, said he asked clinic staff whether his family’s insurance would cover the checkups and immunizations. He said he was assured that it would.
Then the bills came.
The Medical Procedure
The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 and became part of the combination measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine in 1971. Today the vaccine against chickenpox, or varicella, is sometimes combined into what is known as the MMRV vaccine.
A first dose of the measles vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months, with a second between ages 4 and 6. Experts may recommend vaccinating children at younger ages during an outbreak — like the ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, which has led to more than 1,200 cases, 750 of them in Texas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 95% of the cases have occurred in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccine status is unknown.
Recommendations affecting administration and insurance coverage are made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. In mid-June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the committee, adding vaccine skeptics. The new panel, which met last week, is expected to scrutinize past recommendations, including for the MMR vaccine.
The Final Bill
UTMB billed $2,532 for the boy’s office visit and three shots. The MMRV shot alone was billed at $1,422, plus $161 for administering it.
  Because of gaps in their insurance coverage and what an official with the health providerdescribed as billing errors by the primary care clinic, the Nguyen family of Galveston,Texas, ended up owing nearly $5,000 for checkups and immunizations for their threechildren. That included about $1,400 for an MMRV vaccine for 4-year-old Anh Hoang,administered amid the ongoing measles outbreak. (Scott Dalton for KFF Health News)
The Billing Problem: Coverage Gaps and Provider ‘Errors’
There are guardrails in the U.S. health system intended to prevent recommended vaccines from being prohibitively expensive. They did not help the Nguyen family.
Their health plan, purchased from insurance broker TaiAn for Nguyen’s wife and children and administered by the International Medical Group, does not cover immunizations. And, initially, the family was not offered assistance under the Vaccines for Children Program, a federally funded effort, created after a measles outbreak more than 30 years ago, that provides free immunizations for uninsured and underinsured children.
So the family was exposed to the sticker shock of U.S. medical care without insurance, with providers setting prices. In this case, UTMB’s price for the child’s MMRV shot was about $1,400, more than five times what the CDC says it costs in the private sector.
Nguyen was surprised when their insurer did not pay anything, leaving bills for his three children’s checkups that, combined, were close to $5,000.
He said the family’s income, from his job in UTMB’s labs, is less than $57,000 a year. Nguyen’s job provides him health insurance, but he balked at the $615 a month it would cost to cover his family, too, and instead purchased the one-year policy from TaiAn, which totaled $1,841. The policy covers certain types of office visits, emergency room care, hospitalization, and chemotherapy, but not immunizations or checkups.
Nguyen and his wife, who are from Vietnam, are living in the country on temporary visas while he completes his studies. In Vietnam, Nguyen said, the total cost of the preventive care his family received at the clinic would probably be no more than $300.
He was concerned about the high prices set by the clinic for the vaccines, particularly during a measles outbreak.
“It’s insane,” he said.
Carly Kessler, a spokesperson for International Medical Group, confirmed in an email to KFF Health News that the family’s plan does not cover preventive care, including immunizations.
After UTMB was contacted by KFF Health News, its vice president of clinical contracting strategies, Kent Pickering, looked into the matter. “This situation should not have happened” but did so because of “a series of errors,” he said in an interview.
Most insurance offered in the U.S. must cover, without copays, a variety of preventive care services — including the measles vaccine — under rules in the Affordable Care Act. But some plans are exempt from those rules, including short-term plans or travel insurance. International students on temporary visas do not have to buy an ACA-compliant plan during their first five years in the country.
But what about the cost of the vaccines?
Hospitals and other providers may set their own prices for services, creating price lists called chargemasters. Insurers negotiate discounts for services they agree to cover. People with no insurance coverage are generally on the hook for the full amount.
“One of the most frustrating parts of our health care system is that people who don’t have health insurance coverage have to pay far more than even a health insurance company would pay,” said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
While prices can vary, the CDC’s Vaccines for Children Program price list shows the MMRV vaccine — also known by the brand name ProQuad — costs about $278 in the private sector. Consumer prices for ProQuad at Galveston-area pharmacies range from about $285 to $326, according to the prescription cost-tracking website GoodRx.
UTMB’s Pickering told KFF Health News that, initially, the Nguyen family’s insurance was entered incorrectly by the clinic staff, so they did not pick up that his plan didn’t cover vaccines. If they had, UTMB likely would have checked whether the Texas Vaccines for Children Program would cover the cost of the shots, charging only the program’s small administration fee.
A second error was uncovered when Pickering looked into the bill. He said UTMB’s chargemaster had been updated a few months earlier and the vaccine prices for those who do not receive shots through the children’s vaccine program were listed at incorrectly high amounts, resulting in the price Nguyen’s son was charged.
Pickering said the prices had been corrected, though he declined to cite exact figures.
The Resolution
In addition to contacting the insurer, Nguyen reached out to the financial offices at UTMB, asking for a reduction or waiver of the fees.
In mid-May, UTMB sent Nguyen a revised bill for his son’s office visit. It applied a 50% self-pay discount, which its website says is offered to those who are uninsured. His revised total was $1,266, $711 of which was for the MMRV vaccination.
“I expected them to waive the vaccination cost for my children or at least reduce it more, especially for MMRV vaccine,” said Nguyen, noting that his family would still be strapped trying to pay their bills.
After Pickering spoke with KFF Health News, a customer service representative reached out to Nguyen, waiving the cost of the vaccines. His new bill was $202.75 for his son’s office visit, as well as similarly smaller amounts for his daughters’ medical care.
The Takeaway
Medical billing experts say it’s always a good idea to check with your insurer before elective treatments like checkups or vaccinations to find out what is covered and how much you might owe.
International students and others who purchase non-ACA-compliant plans, such as short-term coverage, should carefully review their benefits, because there are often limitations.
For some services, including vaccinations, there may be lower-cost options.
Constance Almendarez, the immunization manager for the Galveston County Health District, said in an email that many public health departments, including Galveston’s, offer free vaccinations through the children’s vaccine program to those 18 and under who are eligible, including people without insurance or whose insurance does not cover vaccines.
But those programs are potentially threatened as the Trump administration institutes layoffs of federal workers and moves to cancel grants to health departments.
Finally, you can ask for a discount. Medical providers may offer self-pay discounts for patients who are uninsured or underinsured, or charity care policies to those who meet specified income requirements.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new statewide cellphone ban received mixed reviews from the Oklahoma City Board of Education while it implemented the policy on Monday.
The board voted 5-1 to restrict student cellphone use throughout the entire school day. Students will be allowed to have cellphones or other personal electronic devices on school premises, on school transportation and at school-sponsored activities, but they are forbidden from using the devices from the morning bell until dismissal at the end of the day. 
All Oklahoma districts have to implement a similar policy to comply with Senate Bill 139. The state Legislature and governor passed the law in May to ban cellphone use in public schools for the 2025-26 academic year with the goal of reducing distractions and behavioral issues in the classroom. 
After 2025-26, local school boards will have the choice to pick a different policy or continue with the same restrictions.
Responses from the Oklahoma City school board were a mix of intrigue, resignation and even frustration with the statewide mandate. 
“I’m pretty excited to hear about student outcomes and how this particular policy will affect that,” board member Jessica Cifuentes said.
Oklahoma City, with just under 33,000 children enrolled, was the largest district still permitting student cellphone access until the new law took effect. A growing number of districts, including the state’s largest, Tulsa Public Schools, already had begun implementing restrictions on cellphones.
Oklahoma City school board member Mike Shelton, a former state lawmaker, cast the only no vote against the new rule.
“I don’t disagree that we should pass a policy, but I’m not for the Legislature dictating what’s going on at the Oklahoma City Public Schools,” Shelton said during the board’s discussion.

Had a majority of the board voted against the policy, “we would put the district in harm’s way,” board Chairperson Paula Lewis said, though she said she does “respect not liking the Legislature telling us what to do.”
The new state law is unequivocal that, for the next academic year, all Oklahoma public schools must ban non-school-issued personal electronic devices except in emergency cases or for students monitoring a health issue.
Shelton also expressed concerns that schools could apply the cellphone ban and student discipline unevenly across the sprawling district.
District administrators and principals “will attempt to be on one accord” when putting the policy in practice at individual schools, Superintendent Jamie Polk said. Polk also pledged to update the board twice this school year on the policy’s implementation and its response within schools.
The new law requires districts to enforce the cellphone ban with disciplinary procedures.

General counsel Tony Childers said Oklahoma City schools will apply the district’s existing conduct regulations, which outline expected responses and punishment based on the severity of a student’s behavior. 
He said the district is “not looking at out-of-school suspension” to punish violations of the cellphone ban.
In-school suspension, detention, phone calls home and loss of privileges are some discipline options for repeat offenses, according to the district’s student code of conduct.

(Photo courtesy Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren’s Facebook page)A wildfire that erupted over the weekend on the Navajo Nation near the New Mexico border has grown to more than 6,200 acres, according to the latest updates.
The Oak Springs fire began Saturday a few miles southwest of Saint Michaels, Ariz. and cast smoke throughout much of the area over the weekend, including nearby Gallup. Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, in updates posted on social media, said wood haulers in the area may have started the fire, though its cause is still officially under investigation.
More than 400 people have responded to the fast-growing wildfire, which is 0% contained. On Monday, in response to the rapid fire spread, a complex incident management team took over the fire, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The Navajo Nation is ordering people in Hunter’s Point and Oak Springs west of mile marker 12 on Navajo Route 12 to flee, along with Saint Michaels’ residents along roads 603, 604, 605 and Navajo Telecommunications Road. An evacuation center is housed at the Window Rock Fighting Scouts Event Center on Navajo Route 12 south of Window Rock High School.
According to Nygren, 23 people sought shelter at the events center on Monday morning.
The fire is the biggest on the Navajo Nation since June 2020, according to a Source review of National Interagency Fire Center records, and is already the second-biggest in more than a decade. The biggest fire, the Wood Springs 2 Fire, burned about 20 miles north of the Oak Springs Fire, consuming more than 12,000 acres.
Crews assigned to the Oak Springs fire are prioritizing protecting the town of Saint Michaels, the corridor along highway 12, including homes and pipelines.
A public meeting will be held at 6 p.m. Monday night at the Fighting Scouts Field House, according to a news release. It will also be streamed on this Facebook page.

Mike DeWine to veto provisions in the GOP-passed state budget that they say would “destroy” them. Amid cuts to their expected funding, levies are being restricted from making the ballot.
School districts are scrambling to fight against the $60 billion operating bill.
“All signs lead one to believe that the real plan is to destroy public education in Ohio in this budget,” Cleveland Heights-University Heights City School District Board Member Dan Heintz said.
Public schools are facing hundreds of millions of cuts to expected school funding. Plus, the state wants to take away some of their savings, capping the carryover revenue at 40% and refunding to taxpayers anything above that.
Districts will be left with two bad choices to make up the lost funds, Heints said.
“It will either come, again, from local taxpayers in the form of more and — let’s be honest — constant levies or it will not come,” he added. “Public school districts will be required to cut and cut and cut and cut until there is nothing left.”
House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said these changes are necessary since homeowners are struggling with property taxes skyrocketing.
“Not only do we have immediate tax relief, we have a new system that eliminates the ability for levies that go on, an emergency levy that never [goes] away,” Huffman said.
Also under the budget, access to the ballot will be even more difficult. Districts will no longer be able to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy.
The bill eliminates levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it prohibits them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
It also prohibits a school district from submitting any current expense levy to voters if it has a general fund carry-over balance of more than 100% of general fund expenditures in the preceding fiscal year. It excludes renewal levies, though.
Even if voters pass a new school levy, the bill allows county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
“If their state of desperation, if that’s what you would call it, can be properly conveyed to the voters in their district, and if it is desperate, I think voters will get that,” the speaker said, adding that some schools won’t see a reduction in funding compared to last year.
Schools need to prove they need the money, which Heintz said he understands — but that levy fatigue is real.
“He’s forcing us into a situation where we will have to go to voters every 2 years and that’s just too much to ask,” the board member said. “It’s too much of a burden.”
Instead of focusing on the mission of the schools, the district and families have to spend time considering a levy campaign, or the superintendent needs to worry about cutting extracurriculars or teachers, he said.
Huffman argued that voters should have all the choices possible since it is their money.
“The best economic decisions get made in a household,” he said.
Heintz and the public school districts are left with one final plea.
“Governor, you have an opportunity to secure your place as one of Ohio’s greatest governors, and the place to begin to be remembered is with the youngest Ohioans,” he said, speaking directly to the governor through our interview. “With a stroke of a pen, you can make it right.”
It’s expected Gov. Mike DeWine will sign the budget and issue his line-item vetoes ahead of the deadline Tuesday.

He said he is also joining the board of an unnamed Second Amendment advocacy organization and moving his firearms training business, Team America Tactical, to Arizona. Armagost is one of the staunchest gun rights advocates in the Legislature. He formed the Second Amendment Caucus last summer, and he sponsored successful legislation this year to felonize all firearm thefts.
He also brought a resolution in 2024 to impeach Secretary of State Jena Griswold after she supported the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove President Donald Trump from the state’s primary ballot.
Armagost was first elected to the Legislature in 2022.
“It has been a privilege to serve with Representative Armagost. His knowledge with regard to law enforcement and public safety made him a tremendous asset to our caucus,” House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese said in a statement. “He will certainly be missed, and I wish him all the best in future endeavors.”
Armagost is the second lawmaker to step down following this year’s regular legislative session. Former Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen resigned earlier this month.

Susan Collins (R-ME) talks with reporters following votes at the Capitol on February 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)“What will Sen. Susan Collins do?” is a question that is once again at the forefront of many political watchers’ minds.
The Senate is in the midst of debating Republicans’ “big, beautiful” reconciliation package, which foists food assistance costs onto states, includes $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid as well as new taxes on renewable energy projects, and will add roughly $3.3  trillion to the national deficit over 10 years, all to pay for an extension of the tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term as well as a dramatic expansion of federal immigration deportation activities.
Just as with the 2017 effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Collins cast a decisive vote against, along with Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, we are in an every-vote-counts moment.
Throughout the negotiation process, Collins has expressed concern about the impact the bill would have on rural hospitals and on some Medicaid recipients, though she does support adding work requirements to the low-income health care program. On Saturday, she voted along with the majority of Republicans to begin debate on the package but said her vote on the motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”
She said she would be filing “a number of amendments,” during the vote-a-rama process, which is expected to last throughout the day Monday with a final Senate vote on Tuesday.
One of those amendments, released Monday, would create a new 39.6% tax bracket for individuals earning more than $25 million and joint filers earning over $50 million and use that to double the proposed $25 billion relief fund for rural hospitals likely to be impacted by the Medicaid cuts as well as changes to state taxes on health providers.
The senator’s office did not say whether she will still vote for the bill if her amendments do not pass.
Collins, who will be on the ballot again in 2026, won her last reelection on a campaign promise that she would use her seniority and authority as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee to deliver for Mainers. 
It is not at all clear how this legislation, even with this proposed tax on the ultra wealthy, does that, given the sheer size and scope of the cuts on the table. In a letter sent last week, Gov. Janet Mills warned Collins and other members of Maine’s congressional delegation that “states like Maine do not have the financial resources to absorb cuts of this magnitude.”
Particularly pointing to proposed federal cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Mills wrote that if enacted “these measures will eliminate vital support from thousands of families, children, and seniors across Maine, strain the finances of state and local governments, destabilize safety net programs for vulnerable populations, and seriously harm our economy.”
After announcing he would not seek re-election, Collins’ colleague, North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, took the Senate floor Sunday night to warn that the current bill would “hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.” Tillis encouraged other senators to eschew the self-imposed July 4 deadline and “take the time to get this right.”
“We owe it to the states to do the work to understand how these proposals affect them,” Tillis said.
Collins also seems to know that passing this bill will be devastating for her state. But the distance between knowing and doing is vast. 
Mainers have been here before — with the weight of substantial federal upheaval seemingly resting on the shoulders of our sole Republican representative. It’s not only reminiscent of the Affordable Care Act vote, but also those times she did not go against the grain, such as the 2018 confirmation vote for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (when Collins said she was assured he was committed to precedent on Roe), and in 2020 when Collins voted against Trump’s impeachment because she believed he learned “a pretty big lesson.” 
I wonder if, after her previous acquiescence to the Trump administration, Collins has learned her lesson.
Sure, Collins has the power to get an amendment passed, but she can also stop this train wreck, or like Tillis encourage her colleagues to go back to the drawing board, because the impacts of this one vote are likely to be felt for years to come.

These include a ban on certain vaping products, changes to automotive insurance policies, and transportation commerce tax.
Here’s a look at a few and what they mean for North Carolinians.
Vape ban

	
Then-Gov. Roy Cooper signed a bill regulating the access of “alternative nicotine products” for youth during the North Carolina General Assembly’s previous session.
The regulation’s wording specifically targets products that aren’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration, describing alternative nicotine products as ones containing nicotine but not tobacco, and are intended for human consumption.
The law technically went into effect on May 1, but includes a 60-day grace period (see page 8). This offers retailers time to adjust after the Department of Revenue publishes the name of approved vape products on its Vapor Certification Directory.
Several were certified May 1, while others were not certified until May 29. It is unlawful for stores to sell products that don’t appear on the list.
There is, however, a loophole. Companies are able to apply for premarket approval and sell their items prior to receiving a decision from the FDA.
Automobile insurance policies

	
North Carolina drivers could see increased insurance premiums due to policy changes taking effect on Tuesday.
At the moment, insurance policies are required to cover minimum liability limits of $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident for bodily injury, as well as $25,000 per accident for property damage, according to the North Carolina Department of Insurance.
A new law will require an increase in minimum limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. The minimum limits for property damage will go up to $50,000.
There will also be an inexperienced operator surcharge for drivers with less than eight years of experience, a raise from the current standard of less than three years of experience. This will only apply to drivers who are first licensed on or after July 1.
The surcharges for years four through eight will be less than surcharges for years one through three, and the new surcharges will gradually lower as the years of driving experience increase.
Transportation commerce tax

	
North Carolina residents can expect higher bills on ride share services and taxis.
A new law implements transportation commerce tax, which is placed on the gross receipts from for-hire ground transport service, according to the North Carolina Department of Revenue. This includes the trip fare, booking fees, surcharges, fuel charges, cleaning fees, and wait time fees.
The tax is due as long as the passenger boards the vehicle, regardless of if the service is completed.
Exclusive ride services — one where an individual or group requests a ride to a destination without being matched with other passengers by the transportation network company, which would result in a single fare paid by the party — would charge a 1.5% tax rate while there’s a 1% tax rate for shared ride services.
For shared ride services, the transportation network company would connect a passenger with another passenger along the planned route. Each separate rider or party would pay a separate fare.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1688-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 14:05:32.181588

Trump signed two immigration-related orders on Monday in an event closed to press photographers. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Gov. Ron DeSantis says he’s spoken with President Donald Trump ahead of his scheduled visit Tuesday to the immigration detention center the state has built in the Everglades.
The presidential visit will take place on the same day the detention center, nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz,” is set to open with a capacity to hold 3,000 immigrants in temporary structures, DeSantis said.
“What will happen is you bring people in there,” DeSantis said during a press conference in The Villages, where he signed the new state budget. “They ain’t going anywhere once they’re there, unless you want them to go somewhere, because good luck getting to civilization.”
The president is “very excited” about authorizing the National Guards to act as immigration judges, an idea the DeSantis administration has been publicly pushing for since March, DeSantis said. But the governor also criticized other states’ lack of action in helping Trump realize his campaign promise of mass deportations.
A federal judge could issue an order to stop the opening of the Everglades detention center following a request for emergency intervention from environmental groups suing state, local, and federal entities over concern about damage to the delicate ecosystem of more than 96% wetlands.
Ongoing protests against the immigration detention center are scheduled to take place Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
“We would not have agreed to do it at that site if I thought that somehow it was going to negatively impact all the great work we’ve done on improving and restoring the Everglades,” DeSantis said.
The detention center is at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport, where environmental concerns led to cancellation of a planned massive jetport during the late 1960s. According to the airport’s website, roughly 900 acres of the 24,960-acre property has been developed.
DeSantis said waste from the site would be self-contained and transported out of it.

An evacuation center is set up in Window Rock.,"Smoke rises from the Oak Springs Fire that ignited Saturday on the Navajo Nation a few miles from the New Mexico border. It's already the second-biggest fire on the Navajo Nation in more than a decade, according to a Source review. (Photo courtesy Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren's Facebook page)A wildfire that erupted over the weekend on the Navajo Nation near the New Mexico border has grown to more than 6,200 acres, according to the latest updates. 
The Oak Springs fire began Saturday a few miles southwest of Saint Michaels, Ariz. and cast smoke throughout much of the area over the weekend, including nearby Gallup. Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, in updates posted on social media, said wood haulers in the area may have started the fire, though its cause is still officially under investigation. 
More than 400 people have responded to the fast-growing wildfire, which is 0% contained. On Monday, in response to the rapid fire spread, a complex incident management team took over the fire, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
The Navajo Nation is ordering people in Hunter’s Point and Oak Springs west of mile marker 12 on Navajo Route 12 to flee, along with Saint Michaels’ residents along roads 603, 604, 605 and Navajo Telecommunications Road. An evacuation center is housed at the Window Rock Fighting Scouts Event Center on Navajo Route 12 south of Window Rock High School.
According to Nygren, 23 people sought shelter at the events center on Monday morning. 
The fire is the biggest on the Navajo Nation since June 2020, according to a Source review of National Interagency Fire Center records, and is already the second-biggest in more than a decade. The biggest fire, the Wood Springs 2 Fire, burned about 20 miles north of the Oak Springs Fire, consuming more than 12,000 acres. 
Crews assigned to the Oak Springs fire are prioritizing protecting the town of Saint Michaels, the corridor along highway 12, including homes and pipelines. 
A public meeting will be held at 6 p.m. Monday night at the Fighting Scouts Field House, according to a news release. It will also be streamed on this Facebook page.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/514448347_1305764674883814_342490005963268734_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 14:05:32.181588

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.


“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Brad Little ordered flags to be lowered at half-staff.

The order remains in place until the day after the memorial service, which has not been scheduled. 
In a statement, Little said the entire state is grieving after the ambush.
“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” the governor said. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”
Little asked the public to join him and the state’s first lady Teresa Little in praying for the victims and their loved ones.
As the U.S. Senate worked early Monday to advance a massive spending and tax cut bill, both of Idaho’s U.S. senators led a moment of silence to honor the victims of Sunday’s attack. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, asked fellow senators to send prayers for the full recovery of the injured firefighter who was released from surgery, along with the victims who died, their families “and the entire North Idaho community grieving this heinous act.”

U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the attack despicable and urged prayers.
“This evil attack on the people who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving our communities is despicable, and it’s not Idaho,” Risch said. 
In updates Sunday evening, Kootenai County law enforcement officials said a dead man with a rifle was located nearby on Canfield Mountain, near where the fire was reported earlier in the day. Late Sunday, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said law enforcement believe the shooter suspect started the fire, describing the event as an ambush.
The injured firefighter faced a critical injury, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post at 10 a.m. Monday Mountain time. But he was in stable condition, local Sheriff Norris said late Sunday. More specific information about his condition and identity has not been released.

The brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, was still burning late Sunday because the active shooter situation delayed firefighting efforts. The fire was estimated to be 15-20 acres by the Idaho Department of Lands in an update at 10 p.m. Pacific time Sunday. The fire’s cause remained under investigation. 
The Idaho Department of Lands is managing the fire, and the agency has the resources currently needed to respond, Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post at 10:24 a.m. Mountain time. 
“Should additional support be required, requests will be made through the appropriate channels,” the office said. “We kindly ask that individuals and organizations refrain from reaching out with resource offers, as their team is receiving a high volume of inquiries.”

In a moment that demands clarity, collaboration and courage, too many of our most visible Black leaders are caught in performative conflicts that trade strategy for spectacle. From city government to the county commission, from the Capitol to the sanctuary, we’re witnessing a crisis not just of policy but of purpose. And Black people in Memphis are paying the price.
Black leaders in Memphis are clashing over what liberation looks like spiritually, economically, and environmentally. The deeper issue may not be the conflict itself but the way we’re engaging it. If we’re not intentional, our disagreements can distract from our collective purpose and diminish the trust our communities place in us.
Take the escalating tensions surrounding xAI’s controversial development in South Memphis. Billionaire Elon Musk’s tech company is constructing a massive supercomputer facility in one of the most disinvested, environmentally burdened Black communities in the city. While Mayor Paul Young has leaned into economic development messaging, Rep. Justin Pearson has sounded the alarm about public health risks and procedural failures, even as organizations like the NAACP prepare to sue.
Yes, there have been public meetings and forums held by advocates for xAI — Young and the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce — and by those concerned by it. I’ve attended some of them. I’ve spoken directly with both organizations. But symbolic appearances are not the same as substantive collaboration. The longer this divide festers in the public eye without coordination, the easier it becomes for corporate interests to exploit the cracks in our collective leadership.
The county budget fight shows a similar pattern. Earlier this week, the Shelby County Commission approved a nearly $2 billion budget with no increase in the property tax rate, a move praised as “fiscally responsible” by County Mayor Lee Harris. But critics like Commissioner Charlie Caswell and several community coalitions have rightfully questioned how so-called “austerity” politics serve the very people who are most harmed by underfunded services, neglected infrastructure, and stagnant wages. 
This isn’t just about spreadsheets. It’s about values. Flat taxes mean flat services. And in communities already flattened by disinvestment, that’s not neutral. That’s negligent.
Then there’s the spiritual arena, a realm that should model moral clarity but often mirrors the same divisiveness. Some of our most well-established Black denominational institutions — including the National Baptist Convention, USA, the National Missionary Baptist Convention of America and the Church of God in Christ — have aligned themselves with corporate partners like Target, accepting funding under the banner of progress, while simultaneously side-stepping grassroots protestors, organizers and younger clergy who have kept the moral fires of justice lit in the streets.
We cannot afford to be this divided, not now, not ever. And we especially cannot afford to confuse:

Personal platform-building, which often centers ego over equity’
Prophetic work, which risks popularity for the sake of truth’
Public witness, which calls power to account with transparency’
Political pragmatism, which should never become an excuse for moral compromise.

Let me be clear. I’m not critiquing from the sidelines. I’ve been in conversation with Young and Pearson. I’ve shared meals, attended meetings, and extended invitations to work through these tensions in ways that are principled and people-centered. The exception is Harris. I’m still working to set up a meeting with him.
What worries me most is how these feuds are beginning to calcify, not around ideas, but around identities. We’re slipping into factionalism. Into camps. Into cults of personality. And while we subtweet each other and swap shade in interviews, Black communities continue to suffer under systems that do not pause while we figure out how to play nice.
This isn’t just about unity for unity’s sake. This is about the utility of our power. It’s about whether we are capable of moving together with enough alignment and enough discipline to shift policy, redistribute resources, and dismantle systems of harm. That’s the work. That’s the call.
Family feuds are fine for entertainment. But for Black freedom? They’re a death sentence.

,Source New Mexico,2025-06-30 16:49:23+00:00,Source New Mexico,Joseph Shepard sued by the New Mexico State Ethics Commission,"Joshua Bowling, Searchlight New Mexico",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/06/30/joseph-shepard-sued-by-the-new-mexico-state-ethics-commission/,State Ethics Commission sues former Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard,"A new lawsuit by the New Mexico State Ethics Commission alleges former Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard used American Disabilities Act funds to build a patio where he hosted his daughter's wedding reception (photo courtesy Searchlight New Mexico)In addition to staying at five-star resorts, buying luxury furniture and traveling the world on the taxpayers’ dime, former Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard also took money intended for building an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant walkway and ramp and used it to build a patio near his house where he could host a welcome event and dancing for his daughter’s wedding, a new lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit, filed quietly by the New Mexico State Ethics Commission on June 27, alleges that Shepard violated the state Governmental Conduct Act, which regulates how employees at all levels of New Mexico government comport themselves. It raises concerns about many of the expenditures first reported in 2023 by Searchlight New Mexico, including nearly $28,000 on exotic furniture from Seret and Sons in Santa Fe.


This article first appeared on Searchlight New Mexico and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.


But it also reveals previously undisclosed spending by alleging that he took “at least $177,404.83” in funding meant for an ADA-compliant ramp and walkway and instead spent it on a patio to host events that were part of his daughter’s wedding in May of that year. It accuses him of directing employees to say that the flowers he bought for the wedding were actually meant for use during graduation ceremonies and that “no one will know the difference.”
“As WNMU President, Shepard had a practice of authorizing university expenditures from which he benefited that were only loosely connected to university purposes,” the 106-page lawsuit alleges. “While a university president has wide latitude to authorize university expenditures for university purposes, the Governmental Conduct Act places a limit on the expenditure of public funds for a private purpose. Shepard transgressed that limit.”
In early November 2022, then-WNMU Capital Projects Director Joseph Holguin was in communication with a contractor about the ADA-compliant ramp project, the lawsuit states. On Nov. 12, 2022, Shepard learned that his daughter was engaged; within weeks, the lawsuit alleges, he began sending her videos of the campus, touting it as a potential wedding venue.
“In one video, Shepard walks through phase one of the capital project, saying that a patio expansion near to the … property would be done in time for the wedding, suggesting the area as a potential venue for wedding related events, and conveying that hosting the wedding at WNMU would cost his daughter nothing,” the lawsuit says. “It would cost WNMU and the public, however.”

In early December 2022, the Shepard family “canceled wedding-related reservations in Arizona, and Shepard planned that WNMU would be the venue for at least some wedding-related events,” the lawsuit alleges.
That same month, Holguin learned that the contractor working on the walkway and ramp couldn’t complete the final phase of the project for less than $300,000. “The $300,000 threshold is significant, because the staff of New Mexico’s Higher Education Department must approve any alterations to university capital projects or site improvements costing over $300,000,” the State Ethics Commission said in its court filing. Holguin was then “directed to reduce the scope of the project to the sidewalk connecting a driveway to the extant patio and a retaining wall to protect the sidewalk from erosion. Yet, not long after that direction, the scope of the capital project grew to include not only a walkway but also an extended patio adjacent to the … property for the purpose of hosting wedding-related events.”
Email correspondence at the time shows Holguin raising concerns that the contractor’s quoted price for the ADA-compliant ramp had increased along with the scope of the job. “Add of change order for irrigation and added electrical scope,” he wrote in a 2022 email to Shepard. “Over 300K … I am not confident we are in a good place to move forward with the number of revised proposals.”
Not long after, Shepard began calling Holguin nearly every day. At one point, the lawsuit says, Shepard insisted that this project be hurried up “because he [Shepard] only had one daughter.”
“On several occasions I personally saw or experienced Dr. Joseph Shepard, then-president of the university, misusing the resources of the university, including employee time,” Holguin is quoted as saying in the lawsuit.
As university president, Shepard lived in an on-campus house. The construction project connected his home to an adjacent building with a large brick walkway and patio. On June 28, the lushly landscaped patio was decorated with overhead bistro lights, fire pits, umbrellas and cushioned patio furniture.

  The patio Shepard’s daughter used for her wedding reception.
As the project progressed, Shepard allegedly “micromanaged” the construction, “including grading changes, utility line adjustments, custom landscaping, and new brickwork — all of which incurred additional costs and further departed from the original ADA-focused plan.” All of this allegedly led to several “sewer breaks” and depleted the university’s inventory of bricks, leading to more purchase orders and more strain on public coffers, the State Ethics Commission claimed.
Despite the delays allegedly caused by micromanagement, the construction was completed in time for the wedding. Emails between Holguin and Kelly Riddle, the university vice president of business and finance, show him fretting about the timeline.
“The site grading changes he made earlier in the day resulted in numerous sewer breaks; this morning, our team is onsite making repairs and lowering the gas line. Additionally, I am concerned that we cannot get the additional concrete. Other jobs are pulling trucks from Deming and Las Cruces,” Holguin wrote to Riddle in April 2023. “There is the possibility we may not have this work done by graduation. However, I am confident everything will be completed for the wedding reception.”
All of this, the State Ethics Commission argues, fits a pattern of Shepard using public dollars for private enjoyment — while finding tenuous connections to the university’s betterment to justify the purchases.
“With respect to the wedding and the patio, Shepard continued the practice of identifying ostensible WNMU purposes to justify expenditures of public funds that were, in fact, intended for a private benefit,” the filing says. “During a meeting with WNMU staff about the wedding, Shepard told WNMU staff members that if anything Shepard purchased for the wedding could be used for university fundraising, he should not have to pay for it.”
His daughter’s wedding invitation and schedule — which features a photo of the couple in front of what appears to be the base of the Superstition Mountains as seen at Lost Dutchman State Park in Apache Junction, Arizona — directs guests to park near Shepard’s residence for the festivities. “Yes,” the invitation reads, “it does show as ‘President’s Residence’ on Google Maps haha.”
The itinerary shows the patio would get a lot of use over the course of the weekend. “This event will be outdoors so bring layers if it gets chilly!” it instructed guests. “We’re planning for a food truck dinner, fire pit and dancing/casual hanging out. If you own cowboy boots, this maaaay be a fantastic time to plan an outfit around them.”
Shepard did not respond to a request for comment.
Shepard-lawsuit
 
After Shepard resigned from his post in December, Searchlight reported, he and his wife, former CIA agent-turned-author Valerie Plame, bought a former wedding venue in Embudo, between Santa Fe and Taos. The terms of Shepard’s departure granted him a $1.9 million severance payment and a new teaching job as a tenured professor with an annual salary of $200,000.
The State Ethics Commission’s suit is the latest action taken against the former WNMU president. In January, Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a civil suit against him and the university Board of Regents — all of whom have since left their posts — and seeks to claw back the $1.9 million severance payment Shepard received upon leaving the job. Shepard has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, but Judge Jarod K. Hofacket has not yet issued a ruling.
The commission opened its investigation into Shepard in November, after the Office of the State Auditor released a scathing report that accused WNMU leaders of improperly spending more than $360,000. Its lawsuit seeks a $250 payment from Shepard for each confirmed violation of the Governmental Conduct Act (capped at $5,000) and for him to pay restitution to WNMU for the construction of the patio.
As for the ramp that was supposed to be built in compliance with the ADA, a law that’s been on the books since 1990, authorities say it’s still nowhere to be found.
“Upon information and belief, WNMU has yet to construct an ADA-compliant ramp for the … property, as originally intended in phase two of the construction project,” Friday’s lawsuit says.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Joseph-Shepard-patio-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 13:08:15.336950

(Joshua Haiar/SD Searchlight)Dusty Johnson will run for governor of South Dakota next year, he confirmed Monday during a campaign event in Sioux Falls.
The announcement was a formality after Johnson was widely rumored to be a candidate and said last week that he planned to make a political announcement Monday.
The 48-year-old Johnson, a Republican and married father of three from Mitchell, currently serves as South Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He said in a press release Monday morning that it’s been “the honor of my lifetime” to serve in Congress, “but it’s time for a new chapter — a chapter that drives South Dakota to a brighter future where we build better schools and safer communities, a chapter that governs with conservative principles to create new jobs, new businesses, and new opportunities in every community, and a chapter where being a workhorse, not a show horse, still means something.”
Johnson is serving his fourth term in Congress. He previously worked as an executive of Mitchell-based telecommunications company Vantage Point Solutions from 2014 to 2018, as chief of staff to then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard from 2011 to 2014, and as an elected member of the state Public Utilities Commission from 2004 to 2011.

Gov. Kristi Noem resigned earlier this year to become secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in President Donald Trump’s administration. Her lieutenant governor, Larry Rhoden, succeeded her and is serving the remainder of her term through next year. Rhoden has not announced whether he will be a candidate to keep the job.
Two other men have already declared their candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor: state House Speaker Jon Hansen and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden. Republican voters will pick their nominee in the June 2, 2026, primary election.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old college student Robert Arnold has announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor.
Johnson’s decision to run for governor will open up his seat in the U.S. House. Last week, Republican state Attorney General Marty Jackley said he plans to seek that office next year, which will create an open race next year for attorney general.
Other major offices up for election next year in South Dakota include the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mike Rounds, who is expected to seek reelection. Democratic businessman and former state trooper Julian Beaudion is seeking his party’s nomination to challenge Rounds. Brian Bengs, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat against U.S. Sen. John Thune in 2022, has said he will run as an independent next year against Rounds.

MDEQ put the warning in place on June 5 after third-party utility JXN Water notified the agency of a “catastrophic” sewer failure at the critical West Bank Interceptor.
“Recent samples of the Pearl River, within the area of the extended advisory, indicate the impact of the untreated sewage has subsided and sample results have returned to pre-incident levels,” the agency said in a June 27 press release.
A 2019 advisory for the river, which runs from Hanging Moss Creek in the northern tip of Hinds County to the Byram Swinging Bridge, is still active. It warns the public against swimming, wading, or fishing in the water because of “ongoing sanitary sewer overflows around the City of Jackson.”
JXN Water discovered the most recent failure on May 28. The malfunction led to the release of between 10 million to 20 million gallons of untreated sewage into the Peal River each day, according to MDEQ. JXN Water stopped the overflow on June 6, nine days after discovering the issue.

Ethics complaints filed with the Vermont Senate against Sens. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, and Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, allege they used their positions on a critical committee negotiating the final form of a wide-ranging education bill to advance provisions that benefited the private schools they are associated with.
Beck, the Senate minority leader, is employed as a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy. Bongartz, the chair of the Senate Education Committee, served almost two decades on the board of Burr and Burton Academy, and has done paid consulting work for the Maple Street School in Manchester.
The complaints, filed with the Senate’s Ethics Committee by Friends of Vermont Public Education board member Geo Honigford, allege that both senators violated ethical standards set forth in state law by negotiating this session’s major education reform bill in a committee of conference — which was charged with reconciling differences in the House and Senate versions — despite their associations with private schools, called independent schools in state law.
The Legislature passed the bill June 16, and Gov. Phil Scott is expected to sign it into law Tuesday.
Honigford, in an email to Senate Ethics Committee members, wrote that the two senators “used their positions to advance provisions that directly benefited the schools they are associated with.”
“I believe this crossed a line,” Honigford wrote. “Vermonters should be able to trust that lawmakers are working in the public interest, not using their influence to benefit their employers or clients.”
Beck, in a phone interview, brushed aside the alleged conflict, saying that “every senator has a connection to their school districts, to their schools.”
“They’re going to advocate for their schools. I would expect nothing less,” Beck said. “That’s what we’re supposed to do. We’re supposed to represent and advocate for our area. I’m no different than that.”
“I do happen to work at a school, but there are other people in the Legislature that work in schools, and we defend our schools and we defend our districts and our towns that make up those districts,” Beck added.
Bongartz, meanwhile, in a phone interview, called the complaint filed against him “complete garbage” and an “amateurish attempt at intimidation.”
“I just think that bringing this level of attempted intimidation to Vermont politics is something I thought I’d never see in this state,” he said. “This is just beyond the pale and completely baseless.”
He added that the “problem is that I understand independent schools, I understand the critical role they play in the areas they serve, and they don’t like that.”
“They don’t like the fact that I’m an articulate voice for something that they don’t like,” he said.
Earlier this month, Bongartz, Beck, Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, and three House members served on the Committee of Conference that shaped the final contours of H.454, the landmark education reform bill set to transform the state’s public education system.
Among its many components, the bill set new limits on which independent schools would remain eligible to receive public funding in the future and how much they would be able to charge. 
The final version of the bill requires that a task force set to craft new school district boundaries include at least one option that maintains the current supervisory union and supervisory district administrative structure, which would support the continuation of historic tuitioning arrangements with independent schools.
In a press release announcing the ethics complaints, the Friends of Vermont Public Education alleged that both senators either fought against, or advocated for, changes that would benefit the independent schools they work for.
Bongartz, for instance, fought to set the threshold for public tuition eligibility for independent schools at 25%, “a number many observers couldn’t explain,” the release said.
“It turns out Maple Street School, one of his clients, has 33% of its students publicly funded. A higher threshold, like the 51% number proposed by the House, would have cut off their public dollars,” the group alleged in their press release. “The lower threshold preserved them.”
Beck, meanwhile, pushed for increased funding for independent career and technical education centers and high schools, including a provision allowing independent schools like St. Johnsbury Academy and Lyndonville Institute — which operate such centers — to set their own tuition rates for public school districts who send students there, according to their release. 
No similar language applies to public high schools with career and technical education centers in the bill, though the legislation does not specifically address how the amount paid to them will be set. Legislators plan to take on that task during the 2026 session.
“St. Johnsbury Academy stands to lose significant taxpayer support under the bill’s new funding formula,” the release reads. “Beck’s efforts helped insert carve-outs and funding increases that will cushion that impact and protect the school’s revenue.”
Beck downplayed that allegation, saying that he was simply “advocating for the status quo.” 
Public and independent career and technical education programs in Vermont are allowed to set their own tuition rates, he said.
“If I had gone in and tried to get something new, like some special good deal for St. Johnsbury Academy, maybe that would be a different story,” he said. “But, effectively, all I was advocating for is the status quo, which is that they get to be able to set their tuition as a CTE center, just like a public school CTE does.”

“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
Living longer
People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
Uncertain grants
Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help to shore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
Skipping pills
In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

Rick Scott talking to reporters and supporters outside La Teresita restaurant in Tampa on Nov. 5, 2024. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A dozen members of Florida’s Republican congressional delegation announced Monday morning that they support the GOP-written economic and domestic policy bill dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and urged their colleagues to do likewise.
The U.S. Senate is poised to vote on the bill later on Monday. If approved,  it would bounce back to the U.S. House for consideration. Republicans aim to place the bill in front of President Trump by July 4.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will lower taxes for hardworking families, seniors and small businesses, protect Medicaid and strengthen America’s border security,” their letter reads. “We are committed to seeing this bill become law on behalf of all Floridians.”
Signing the letter were Aaron Bean, Vern Buchanan, Byron Donalds, Neal Dunn, Randy Fine, Carlos Giménez, Mike Haridopolos, Laurel Lee, Anna Paulina Luna, Brian Mast, Jimmy Patronis, and Daniel Webster.
Eight Florida House Republicans did not. They are Kat Cammack, Maria Elvira Salazar, Mario Diaz-Balart, Gus Bilirakis, Scott Franklin, Cory Mills, John Rutherford, and Greg Steube.
Medicaid cuts
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has said that the Senate bill would cut more than $930 billion from Medicaid. But the Florida congressional Republicans say in their letter that the bill is “protecting and strengthening for American citizens who need it by rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, and implementing common sense work requirements.”
Florida Sen. Rick Scott and several other GOP members of the Senate announced on Sunday that they are introducing an amendment that would end the existing system under which the federal government pays 90% of the costs in states that have expanded Medicaid based on the Affordable Care Act.
Beneficiaries enrolled before Dec. 31, 2030, would be grandfathered in at the existing rate, but new enrollees would see their medical costs reimbursed at the lower Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate, which could be as low as 50%. The CBO says that the amendment, if passed, would save an additional $313 billion in federal spending, according to The Hill.
“Critics of the bill’s Medicaid fixes fail to mention the millions of able-bodied adults who access Medicaid while refusing to work,” the Florida Republicans assert in their letter.
“Through the Affordable Care Act, Democrats expanded Medicaid eligibility to include any adult earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level and below. Florida has not opted to expand Medicaid to this population. The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that less than $1.5 billion of federal Medicaid dollars are spent on childless, non-working, able-bodied adults in Florida — less than in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, Michigan and Arizona.
“This means that Floridians’ federal tax dollars are subsidizing Medicaid for able-bodied adults in less populous, Democrat-run states. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act institutes common-sense work requirements that will increase labor participation and reserve Medicaid dollars for those who need them most: the elderly, pregnant women, pregnant women, disabled Americans and needy children.”
The Florida Republicans in their letter also highlight provisions that would eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay for low- and medium-wage workers.
“Over 193,000 workers across the Sunshine State are employed as restaurant servers, making Florida one of the states with the highest employment level of waiters and waitresses,” the letter reads.
“Tips account for approximately 21.3 percent of Florida restaurant workers’ incomes, meaning these workers depend heavily on customer generosity and see significant unpredictability in their earnings. Similarly, Floridians who receive overtime pay, including our brave men and women in law enforcement, go above-and-beyond every day to make ends meet. Exempting tips and overtime pay from federal income tax will bring financial stability to hundreds of thousands of Floridians.”
Polls show opposition to the legislation
All members of the Florida Democratic congressional legislative delegation opposed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” when it came before the House on May 22. They all are expected to oppose it again if the Senate passes its version of the bill this week.
The legislation is viewed unfavorably by 64% of Americans, according to a KFF health tracking poll of 1,321 adults conducted June 4-8, with a margin for error of three percentage points.
Another survey conducted by Fox News of 1,003 registered voters found that 59% oppose the bill with just 38% supporting it. That survey was conducted between June 13-16.

The VA announced in March that it would no longer cover gender affirming care for trans servicemembers or vets, but that people who were already receiving the medicine would continue to.
Army veteran Jane Doe was one of the people who had been getting the meds for years. WSHU has granted her anonymity due to her fear of retaliation from the Defense Department.
When she went to refill her prescription, Doe’s pharmacy told her her insurance no longer paid for her medication. She appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals, but didn’t hear back, so she sued the VA. Within a month of the lawsuit, the VA acknowledged it had made a mistake in removing Doe’s coverage.
“Having dealt with government as closely as I have over so many years in the military, I never expected them to just so quickly be like, ‘Yes, we were wrong,’ and walk away and grant the request,” Doe said.
Doe’s lawyer, Hillary Browning from the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School, said systemic safeguards have to be put in place to keep this from happening again.
“Our hope is that they sort of learn their lesson, and if they didn’t learn their lesson, they see that there are veterans out there who are willing to hold them to the policies that they’ve put in place,” Browning said.
Doe and her legal team say they don’t know why the decision was made so fast. But Doe said it shows that the uphill battle was worth it.
“Just because the government is a Goliath doesn’t mean that David doesn’t win sometimes.”
The VA was invited to participate in this story, but the request was declined.

View and rate the answers from Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, whose two-term administration ends Tuesday.","Q: Why are there so many traffic lights out in the city?
A: Aging infrastructure, vehicle collisions and arsonists.
Q: Where do I go if I want to get a pothole fixed?
A: Call 311.
Q: Why do you hate white people?
A: I do not hate white people.


These are some of the questions folks had recently for outgoing Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba – and his answers.
In 2024, Lumumba began an initiative called “Ask Antar,” in which residents could submit inquiries and concerns through the city’s website.
The city received more than 180 questions. Mississippi Today requested and reviewed them all and found that in the last year, Jacksonians have had the most curiosity and frustration about accessing services and responsiveness from City Hall, housing and homelessness, and street conditions.
Lumumba, whose two-term administration ends Tuesday, responded to about a fourth of the questions, plus more submitted through social media, across 15 video segments on the city’s YouTube page. In many videos, the mayor explained processes – such as how environmental courts determine what to do about derelict structures or why Jackson Police Department is unable to address squatting unless it receives a report from the owner of a specific property.
Another theme among his answers was that the administration is not in control of all functions people had complaints about – like in the case of water rates now governed by private manager JXN Water, or street lights on interstates that are a state responsibility. He also said the administration did not have resources to address all problems – potholes, for example.
Mississippi Today went a step further, contacting people who submitted questions. Of the two dozen who responded to the news organization, most had no idea the mayor had answered their questions.
“Why is it you replied to my email, yet I never heard from the city of Jackson?” said one person, who had asked in December about the broken stop light at the intersection of Woodrow Wilson and State Street.
For those whose questions Lumumba answered, we directed each person to the corresponding video and asked them to rate their satisfaction with the answer on a scale of 1 to 5.

Mississippi Today requested an interview with Lumumba to discuss our findings, but city spokesperson Melissa Payne said he was unavailable. Lumumba lost reelection during the April Democratic primary and was working on transitioning out of office to make way for Mayor-elect John Horhn. Lumumba’s last question-and-answer segment was posted April 20, two days before he lost in the primary runoff.
Three residents made submissions to Ask Antar seeking space to hold dance classes in the city, and recent high school graduate Javion Shed asked about what the mayor is doing to combat youth violence and introduce positive activities for teens. 
“As a teen in Jackson, you’re always plagued with, what can I do on the weekends, where can I go to just relax, have a great time, and not worry about the fear of violence or the fear of someone I know getting killed?” Shed told Mississippi Today.
In response to Shed last October, Lumumba said the city was developing a curfew center, where teens who may otherwise end up at the youth detention facility could be taken instead to receive services. Shed ranked the response a “solid 4” out of 5. Amid turmoil in the city’s Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery, though, the center Lumumba described has yet to open.
Several residents raised concerns with a lack of communication and listening among the administration. Referencing a three-year fight between the mayor and city council over renewing the city’s garbage contract, which led to trash pickup interruptions in 2023, one resident wrote that the mayor’s “antics and over-complication of intent” created a “4-lane thoroughfare for justified criticism of the ability of African Americans to use critical thinking analysis, and compromise to would-be detractors.” 
Another wrote, “When you become Mayor, we become Mayor was part of your campaign slogan at one point … Why can’t you listen to the recommendations from us via our Council Person?”
Others said they were unable to reach city officials to answer questions or receive basic city services. There were inquiries about getting an electrical pole removed, about repairs to a water meter and about where to drop off old paint cans “now that the household hazardous waste dropoff is closed due to fire.”
“Why don’t the traffic office answer the phone??????” one resident wrote.
One woman who submitted a question about the federal corruption allegations against Lumumba, for which he’s pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to face trial next summer, admitted her intent was to troll the mayor.
But many more of the submissions conveyed the serious and dire conditions some Jacksonians are living in.
Last July, Carlyn Cornelius submitted concerns about the unhoused population near his mother’s house in west Jackson stealing trailers and cars, burning copper and dumping antifreeze. He told Mississippi Today that a year later, the problems remain.
In his submission, Corneluis said he’d called in reports of these activities to law enforcement, the fire department, Public Works, environmental authorities and the owner of the property, but received no help.
A few days later, another person submitted to Ask Antar, “I need a place to live. I am homeless.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/30075547/ask-antar.jpg,,,2025-06-30 12:16:26.476340

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Heather Cessna is resigning as executive director of the state public defender’s office after years of warning apathetic legislators about the constitutional crisis they created by persistently underfunding her agency.
Cessna said the Legislature’s refusal to adequately support public defense work will result in criminal cases being dismissed because there are no attorneys available to represent impoverished defendants.
“It is not a question of if it will happen,” Cessna said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “It is a question of when and where. And I can tell you we are on the verge of that every single day in every jurisdiction.”


Friday was Cessna’s last day at the Board of Indigents’ Defense Services, the public defense agency she has led since October 2019. She is preparing to join the faculty at Washburn University School of Law.
Cessna has appeared annually before the Legislature to warn lawmakers of the inherent constitutional crisis they created by underfunding public defense for 30 years — while prosecutors have enjoyed unchecked power to file more and more criminal cases, she said.
Lawmakers have refused to add sufficient resources to Cessna’s budget. This year, they responded to her call to action by cutting her budget by 1.5%.
The U.S. Constitution guarantees defendants the right to legal counsel and a speedy trial, and 84% of adult felony cases in Kansas require appointed counsel.
Cessna’s agency employees 300 workers, including defense attorneys, mitigation specialists, investigators and legal assistants. Her office also provides administrative oversight for the 350 private attorneys who are willing to be appointed to cases. Combined, they are expected to handle 30,000 criminal cases per year, Cessna said.
“One of the most frustrating parts of the legislative session this year was sitting through some of our budget hearings, where individuals who I’ve had this conversation with over and over again, who we’ve filed testimony in front of, we filed reports in front of, we’ve been very clear at every step along the way that we are in a constitutional crisis right now,” Cessna said. “And the fact that we’re holding it together with duct tape and bubble gum doesn’t mean that it’s less of a constitutional crisis.
“And yet, there were conversations during our budget hearings about how, ‘Well BIDS is not in a constitutional crisis right now. So how is the impact of this budget decision gonna put them in a constitutional crisis next year?’ And it was about all I could do to keep from coming unglued during that conversation, because I don’t know how much more clearer I could be about it.”
  Heather Cessna says public defenders in Kansas face unacceptable caseloads. “It has turned into a system where we tend to triage cases instead of actually representing people,” she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Her cries for help were underscored earlier this year when the Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center at Southern Methodist University in Texas released a 23-page report on the public defense crisis in Kansas. The report highlighted the “dire shortage” of public defenders, work stress caused by high caseloads, and the likelihood that the crisis is about to worsen.
The report found that public defenders in Kansas handled an average of 170 cases per year. If they worked 40 hours per week for all 52 weeks of the year, they would spend an average of 12 hours on each case.
“As a result, people accused of crimes in Kansas face tough choices,” the report concluded. “Will they languish in jail, waiting for their attorney to have time to defend them? Will they consider pleading guilty despite possible defenses, risking incarceration, fines, and a loss of rights, just to put the criminal court process behind them?”
Cessna put it this way: “It has turned into a system where we tend to triage cases instead of actually representing people.”
She said the standard to provide minimally competent counsel for a low-level felony case is 33 hours per attorney. The minimal standard for a first-degree murder case would be 240 hours, she said.
“So 12 hours is absolutely a crisis, and that’s one of the reasons why we have repeatedly gone over and asked for additional staffing from the Legislature,” Cessna said. “Because the truth of the matter is we’ve got too many cases coming in to these jurisdictions, they’re being charged, and we don’t have the number of staff that we need to be able to support those caseloads.”
She said lawmakers have been unwilling to support public defense in part because “our clients are not the most popular people, and it is not usually a popular topic to add money into criminal defense.”
“Now, I will counter that by saying that the vast majority of our clients are presumed innocent, and that’s an important thing to remember when we’re talking about public defense,” Cessna said. “These are people who have not been convicted of a crime.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6260488-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-30 11:08:09.492057

YWCA Delaware has named Carolann D. Wicks, P.E., as its new Board President, ushering in a new chapter of leadership for the nonprofit dedicated to eliminating racism and empowering women.
Wicks, a longtime advocate of YWCA Delaware’s mission, officially assumes the role on July 1, succeeding Karen Smith, whose eight-year board tenure included three years as president.
The Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to empowering women, young women, and girls. The organization focuses on eliminating racism, empowering women, and promoting peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all.
“I’ve always believed that when women are empowered, entire communities thrive,” Wicks said. “Serving on the YWCA Delaware Board allows me to be part of lasting change. I want the next generation of women to have even more opportunities to lead and succeed.”

Smith led the organization through a period of growth and resilience, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, while helping expand advocacy efforts and extend services to more than 42,000 clients.
“Karen’s legacy is one of strength, impact, and community,” Wicks said. “I am honored to follow in her footsteps and build upon the incredible foundation she and others have laid. As Board President, I’m committed to ensuring that our programs remain strong and that our future remains bright.”
Wicks joined the board in 2018 and has since served in several leadership roles, including Board Treasurer, Executive Board Member, and President-Elect. She brings with her an extensive background in public policy, infrastructure, and operations.
Currently the Chief Operating Officer of The Reybold Group, Wicks oversees multiple departments, including marketing, HR, and property management.
Her career includes a term as Delaware’s Secretary of Transportation and a senior policy fellowship at the University of Delaware’s Institute for Public Administration. In 2002, she made history as the first female Chief Engineer of DelDOT.
Wicks has received multiple accolades for her service and leadership, including Delaware Engineer of the Year, induction into the First State Hall of Fame, and the prestigious Order of the First State.
Her civic contributions also include board positions with NCC Habitat for Humanity, Pennoni Engineering, the 4-H Foundation, and the University of Delaware.
YWCA Delaware CEO Melissa Gonville praised Wicks’ appointment, citing her background in policy and operations as key to the organization’s long-term goals.
“As we continue to adapt in today’s ever-changing nonprofit landscape, we’re staying focused on the long-term growth of our programs,” Gonville said. “Carolann’s expertise in infrastructure, policy, and community impact will help us strengthen our foundation and reach even more people in need.”
As Board President, Wicks is expected to focus on sustaining the organization’s core programs while helping chart a strategic path forward amid a changing nonprofit landscape.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-1.jpg,,,2025-06-30 11:08:09.492057

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ tax and spending cuts package, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
Fate of public land dispute remains unclear as politicians cheer dismissal of ranchers’ charges

“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”

Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.










The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks.


– Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers


“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

Lowry Barnes (Courtesy of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences)Dr. C. Lowry Barnes will become the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ interim chancellor on July 11, according to a Monday news release from the UA System. 
Barnes, a professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at UAMS, replaces Dr. Cam Patterson, who served as chancellor and UAMS Health CEO for seven years before announcing plans earlier this month to step down for personal and medical reasons. Patterson’s last day in his current role is July 10, and he will return to a faculty position in cardiology at UAMS, according to the release. 
“Dr. Barnes is a nationally known orthopaedic surgeon whose name has been synonymous with UAMS and success at that campus for many years,” UA System President Jay B. Silveria said in the release. “I trust his knowledge, passion, and leadership to steer the state’s only academic health sciences center during this time of transition.”
UAMS chancellor stepping down after 7 years, returning to faculty

The planning process for a national search for UAMS’ next chancellor is underway, and an advisory search committee was named Monday. The committee will help develop a short list of candidates for Silveria to consider before presenting his selection to the UA Board of Trustees for final approval, according to the release.
Barnes is a UAMS graduate and a fellowship-trained, board-certified orthopaedic surgeon specializing in joint reconstruction and replacement surgery of the hip and knee. He joined UAMS in 2014 as professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. In 2017, he was invested in the Carl L. Nelson, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Orthopaedic Surgery. 
He also serves as the director of the Musculoskeletal Service Line at UAMS Health, and is the founding director of the Orthopaedic and Spine Hospital at UAMS, which opened in 2023.
“My passion for serving patients has always extended beyond my immediate work to a drive and ambition to make UAMS and this state better places,” Barnes said in the release. “I’m honored to have been considered to take on this challenge…Working under the transformative power of the UA System, we will continue to expand our efforts to improve the health, health care and wellbeing of all Arkansans.”
The search committee will soon begin by working with a search firm to finalize a chancellor position profile and advertising the open position to open the search process, according to the release.

(Screenshot)Two firefighters have been killed and another is injured after crews in North Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response.
Kootenai Health spokesperson Kim Anderson said three victims were brought to the Coeur d’Alene hospital, the Associated Press reported. Two were dead on arrival and the third is being treated for injuries, Anderson said, according to the AP.
The injured firefighter has been released from surgery, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a 9:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday press conference. Information about his injuries or their extent was not released.
“He is fighting for his life but is in stable condition,” the sheriff said.
The fire was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near the east side of Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene. The shooter opened fire around 2 p.m., Norris said. The sheriff said he believes the two incidents are related.
“We do believe that the suspect started the fire, and we do believe that it was an ambush and that it was intentional,” Norris said. “We do believe he started it, and it was totally intentional, what he did.”
At about 8:50 p.m. Sunday, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that a responding SWAT team located a dead man with a rifle nearby on Canfield Mountain.
A shelter-in-place order from the Kootenai County Emergency Management system has now been lifted, according to the sheriff’s office.
However, the brush fire, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, is still burning because firefighters had to suspend their response while the shooter was still active.
“There is still an active wildfire on Canfield Mountain,” Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a Sunday night post on Facebook. “Local residents should be prepared and ready in the event that the situation escalates. Please continue to follow official sources for accurate information.”
Fire crews were unable to access the fire until it was deemed safe at around 7:30 p.m., the Idaho Department of Lands said in a press release.
“Crews estimate the fire to be about 15-20 acres, with numerous snags and steep terrain,” the press release says. “Additional resources including aircraft, heavy equipment, water tenders, engines, hand crews and a Type 3 Incident Management Team are on order and anticipated to work the fire tomorrow.”
The cause of the fire remains under investigation, the Department of Lands said in the release.
The Canfield Mountain area has been designated a no-fly zone, “including a strict prohibition on drone use,” the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in Sunday night press release. “Unauthorized aircraft or drones in the area pose a serious risk to firefighting and law enforcement operations.”
The sheriff urged the public to wait until official information is released by law enforcement to donate to funds to benefit the victims’ families. Scammers have been known to take advantage of tragedies like this and start GoFundMe fundraising campaigns without the consent of the families, he said.
 North Idaho shooter opens fire on firefighters responding to emergency call

“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said.
The responding fire crews, which included three engines, were dispatched from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue and the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.
One of the firefighters killed was from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, while the other was from the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department. The injured firefighter served the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, Norris said.
“There is a belief that (the shooter) ran and shot, so we don’t know what (evidence) we might be collecting once the fire threat diminishes,” Norris said.
Norris said the suspect’s body was removed from the scene to preserve it due to the threat of the fire.
The sheriff held two press conferences on Sunday: one at 4:30 p.m. Pacific, and one at 9:30 p.m.
“We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris said at 4:35 p.m. Pacific time. “This is an active situation. We have multiple agencies that are on scene from local and federal authorities, and we are prepared to neutralize this suspect who is currently, actively shooting at public safety personnel.”
The sheriff said “it appears modern-day sporting rifles are being used” in the attack.
Norris initially said law enforcement was unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers, but at the evening press conference, he said the ongoing investigation was pointing to one shooter. At the afternoon conference, he said officers and deputies were reporting from the scene that the shooter was “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said at the afternoon press conference. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Authorities are unsure whether the shooter was killed by responding officers or if he killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Norris said. He said an autopsy of the suspect’s body is scheduled in Spokane and would offer more information on how he died.
Multiple local North Idaho, state and federal agencies — an estimated 300 law enforcement officers, some from as far away as Montana — responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, said in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.
 Idaho officials respond to Coeur d’Alene shooting

Kootenai County Commission chairman Bruce Mattare said the shooting was “senseless and tragic beyond words.”
“June 29,2025, is a day that we will not forget in this community,” Mattare said at the evening press conference. “It is the day evil showed its face and we lost two outstanding professionals of the highest quality, and I cannot fathom why anyone would commit such a heinous act.”
The commissioner said this kind of “senseless violence is unheard of here” and does not reflect Coeur d’Alene as a community.
“When you hear how others portray the people who live here on the news, it’s not true,” Mattare said. “What happened here decades ago is not reflective of the fine people who live here today. And I want everyone to know that this is a wonderful place to live, to raise your family and visit.”
He stressed that resources were being provided at the state and federal level to investigate the killings and fire.
“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a post on X. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure and process the scene.
“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Rep. Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, both R-Idaho, also posted on X that they are monitoring the reports on the incident and are praying for the first responders and their families.
“I am monitoring the horrific reports out of Coeur d’Alene this evening,” Crapo posted. “I urge local residents to follow recommendations of law enforcement. My prayers are with victims and first responders.”
In a statement at 7 p.m. Sunday, Idaho House Republican leadership said they were “shocked by such a vicious attack.”
“We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues,” the statement said.

With limited progress made this legislative session, it’s unclear what pathway the state has for meeting its emissions targets.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  The clean heat standard is dead. What comes next?.","Vermont, the state with the lowest overall carbon emissions in the country, has become a national leader in efforts to address climate change. But this year, lawmakers were subdued about further efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions. 
One reason was that the political climate had changed. 
Democrats lost more seats in Vermont than anywhere else in the country last November. The state faced multiple lawsuits against its landmark plan to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their contributions to a warming world. Gov. Phil Scott, a legion of heating fuel dealers and a media campaign run by a conservative super PAC convinced voters that the state’s plan to reduce its second largest source of fossil emissions — heating — was too expensive to be implemented. 
“Everyone knew the plan was dead the day after the election,” said Matt Cota, a member of the Public Utility Commission’s Clean Heat Technical Advisory Group that studied the proposal, known as the clean heat standard.

At the national level, fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas — the largest drivers of climate change and increasingly expensive energy sources to produce and burn — strengthened their foothold in the U.S. economy when President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency on the first day of his second term. 
In Vermont, meanwhile, action on climate quieted, and perhaps the state’s most comprehensive plan under consideration to reduce emissions entered a state of limbo. The clean heat standard, half a decade in the making, would have established a wonky credit market to regulate the heating of air and water in buildings like homes and hospitals. But it was neither adopted as law nor formally repealed this legislative session. 
Instead, key lawmakers shuffled the plan into the dusty corners of committee. Advocates and lawmakers do not expect it to reemerge.
The program’s failure could leave the state with fewer options to reach the goals of the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act, which legally mandates reducing emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by the midcentury. Critics say the state already missed the first deadline, and the first lawsuit against the state has already been filed. 
Under the shadow of that deadline, why did the clean heat standard fail, and what might Vermont do next?
An incentive structure
Vermonters are among more than 10 million households, largely in New England and the Midwest, still dependent on heating fuels, like oil or propane, according to a May 2025 national report from RMI, an energy think tank. Most of the households that use heating fuels live in single-family homes and skew more rural, older and more likely to live on a fixed income.
The clean heat standard, also known as the Affordable Heat Act, was compelling because it relied on incentives. Instead of a simple tax, or fee, on heating bills, like the charge Vermonters see on their electric bills to fund efficiency programs, the program attempted to promote efficiency through a credit system.
“The first conversation was, how can we reward these heat fuel dealers performing this efficiency work, this good work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by creating an incentive structure?” Cota said.
Fuel dealers have long delivered the fossil fuels to heat individual homes through Vermont’s long winters. But these fuels and the people who distribute them are less regulated than other forms of energy like electricity. The standard would have created a registry that tracked fuel dealers and worked to help them acquire credits.

Each “clean heat credit” represented a unit of greenhouse gas emissions eliminated because of actions taken by fuel dealers. Details like how fuel dealers could earn such credits were still in the works, but the intention was to push fuel dealers to promote weatherization and more efficient heating systems like cold-weather heat pumps. Then customers could access state incentives to help pay for them. (Additional incentives of up to $2,000 for heat pumps once available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act are now on the Trump administration’s chopping block.)
Switching to more efficient heat pumps could reduce energy bills by an annual average of $990 in Vermont, according to the RMI report on heating fuels. Across the country, customers could save an average of $15,000 over the life of the heat pump. If all delivered fuels were replaced with heat pumps, the country would save nearly $8 billion in energy costs, according to the report.
But program expenses rose because of possible subsidies prioritizing low- and middle-income Vermonters. As fuel dealers looked at taking on the costs of the program, it seemed clear that some of those costs would have to be passed onto customers, according to a January report submitted by the Public Utility Commission. The kind of credit system had also never been done before, and Vermont would have had no other state’s model to rely upon, which also increased overhead costs.
“Modeling a complex sector-wide program is extremely difficult and relies on a number of assumptions that could vary widely from real-world implementation,” wrote the public utility commissioners in the January report to the Legislature. They told lawmakers their estimates should be taken as “very rough.”
Customers would pay approximately $0.08 more per gallon of fuel oil in 2026, according to the report, or about $56 for residents who bought an average of 700 gallons to heat their home. If customers continued to use fossil fuels instead of taking advantage of incentives to switch to other options, the cost could rise to $0.58 per gallon, or about $406 more by 2035 for the same amount of fuel.
For the first decade, the commission’s report estimated the program could cost the state, including those costs to customers, as much as $956 million. The commission did not recommend implementing it. 
‘They just parked it’
While that number is large, whether it’s considered affordable depends on a number of factors like how Vermonters heat their homes, the flexibility of their spending, and whether they use state incentives to lower their fossil fuel use.
But the governor took the position that the plan was unaffordable no matter what. In 2022, Scott vetoed the bill’s first version, H.715, and that veto was sustained by a single vote in the House. 
A year later, in May 2023, it became the Affordable Heat Act, or S.5, a bill that set up the clean heat standard for further study but did not implement the program. Scott again vetoed the bill, but this time he was overruled by the then Democratic supermajority in both chambers. 
That new law, Act 18, gave the Public Utility Commission and two advisory groups 18 months to figure out the details. In the 2025 legislative session, once the commission issued its January report, little action was taken. Another bill, S.65, would have repealed the clean heat standard completely but never made it out of committee.

While the commission’s final report was in development, the conservative super PAC Americans for Prosperity, funded by the Koch brothers, launched a $60,000 digital and mailer campaign claiming the standard would “skyrocket” Vermonter’s utility bills and “wreak havoc on Vermonters’ wallets.”
That campaign skewed the definition of affordability and promoted misinformation, according to advocates of the law. But the Green Advocacy Project, a pro-clean heat group, contributed three times that — $180,000 — to a Vermont super PAC to boost candidates supporting the program.
But even that didn’t help incumbents like Chris Bray, the former Democratic chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy who served in the Legislature for more than a decade. He lost his November race. In early June, Bray said part of that loss had to do with the campaign against the clean heat standard. 
“The fossil fuel industry was vehemently opposed,” Bray said. “It would’ve been the country’s first assessment on fossil fuels designed to look at their emissions impact and translate that into a variable fee.” 
Bray had pushed back against the argument that the program was unaffordable. He asked lawmakers to consider not just the climate impacts but the volatile pricing of fossil fuels. During the winter of 2020 through the winter of 2023, the cost of heating oil more than doubled, according to numbers Bray compiled from the Department of Public Service and Joint Fiscal Office. 
While the governor often cited a potential $4 per gallon increase in fuel costs, far more than what the final commission report concluded. 
If he’d continued on as chair, Bray wanted to see his committee push the standard forward by working out wonky details like how much a credit would cost and how they could be obtained. But too many Democrats lost, he said, and the ones who remained were chastened by the governor’s claims that the program was unaffordable. 
“They just parked it,” Bray said of Democrats. 
There wasn’t enough movement on climate and environmental work this session because legislators were playing defense rather than going on the offensive and continuing to try and make progress, Bray added.
Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, who took over as chair of the Natural Resources and Energy Committee after Bray lost his seat, said the standard wasn’t a great fit for Vermont at this time. Because Vermont would be starting the standard from scratch, there were high overhead costs, and it would be easier if another state enacted the law first, she said.
“Nobody wanted to move forward with implementing it this session,” Watson said. But she largely blamed state leadership.

“It’s unfortunate that we’re limited by a governor who doesn’t want us to do the hard work of getting Vermonters off of expensive, price-volatile fossil fuels,” Watson said. 
At a conference in June at the University of Vermont, Lt. Gov. John Rodgers repeated these talking points, claiming that consumers, not oil companies, would have to pay for the clean heat standard. 
“Every oil company has said, ‘This is our business. If we have extra cost we have to pass it on to the consumer,’” Rodgers said in an interview afterward. “But there are people in the Legislature that are saying ‘oil companies are going to pay for it,’ and it’s just a false narrative.”
He said the Affordable Heat Act should be repealed because Vermonters couldn’t afford it. 
When asked if paying roughly $50 a year on heating oil was unaffordable — which Vermonters would pay in 2026, according to the PUC — Rodgers said he would have to go back to the report. 
“I thought it was much more than $0.08,” Rodgers said, adding that if there was a real benefit from the standard, he might consider $0.08 a gallon affordable. 
‘There isn’t currently an active plan’
As Vermont creeps toward its self-imposed, legally binding emissions deadlines, pieces of its first plan to mitigate its contribution to climate change continue to fall away. 
In 2021, a multistate pact to create a cap-and-invest program that would have reduced emissions from transportation, called the Transportation and Climate Initiative Program, crumbled. Another plan to phase out the use of gasoline-powered cars and trucks is under direct threat from the Trump administration. Now, the clean heat standard appears to be scratched off the list. 
Last Tuesday, in a courthouse in Montpelier, Vermonters began to see the first skirmishes in what could be a long, drawn-out battle if the state doesn’t come up with new ideas for meeting its goal. 
“There’s a mechanism in the Global Warming Solutions Act where there’s accountability for exactly this, where you have a governor obstinate against climate goals,” Sen. Watson said. “It’s played out in Massachusetts and maybe it needs to play out here.” 
That mechanism is a citizen lawsuit. 
Jenny Rushlow, an attorney in the clean energy and climate change program at the Conservation Law Foundation, successfully litigated that Massachusetts case. 
Now, her group is in the first stages of a suit filed against Vermont’s Agency of Natural Resources, the state body in charge of implementing those reductions. The suit, filed in September 2024, alleged that the state was on track to miss the January 1, 2025, target to reduce emissions by 26% below 2005 levels. 
The agency sought to dismiss that suit, and now both parties await the judge’s decision. If he denies that motion, the Conservation Law Foundation’s case — which argues that the review was so insufficient it was rendered invalid — would proceed, according to Elena Mihaly, the vice president for the organization in Vermont, after oral arguments on the motion.

“There isn’t currently an active plan for how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the thermal sector at the level that’s required,” Rushlow said. “The clean heat standard was the focal point for reducing emissions from that sector, and it died under pressure from outside fossil fuel interests and misinformation about the cost of the program.” 
But Mihaly said no part of this lawsuit hinges on whether the clean heat standard passed, nor could a judge siding favorably with her foundation force the Legislature to pass the standard or the Agency of Natural Resources to adopt it. 
Instead, the latest focal point in the Global Warming Solutions Act is the new Climate Action Plan set to be published on July 1, which will reset the state’s priorities in reducing emissions. That plan is developed by a 23-member Climate Council legally obligated to produce the plan every four years. Now the council is considering a modified clean heat standard, according to Cota, who serves on the council.
While the clean heat standard could have been a key mechanism to help them meet the emissions goals of the Global Warming Solutions Act, “it was not ever going to be the silver bullet,” Watson said.
A leaky roof
With limited progress made this legislative session, it’s unclear what pathway the state has for meeting its emissions targets.
“When you look at what this Legislature did — or more accurately didn’t do — on climate this session as compared to the last few years, it’s a stunning reversal,” Rushlow said. “That being said, the Legislature doesn’t have a supermajority, and Gov. Scott loves to veto, particularly on issues related to the environment. So it’s completely understandable that they were not confident in their ability to make progress on climate this session.”
In lieu of meeting the state’s climate goals, Scott and fellow lawmakers have tried to cripple the Global Warming Solutions Act. During the legislative session, the House Energy and Digital Infrastructure Committee took up H.289, a bill that never made it out of committee but is intended to defang the Global Warming Solutions Act.
In March, Jared Duval, a member of the Vermont Climate Council, testified on the bill, telling lawmakers: “It is important that we remember that there are costs not just to action, but of inaction.” 
He gave an example: If you have a leak in your roof, there’s a cost to get it fixed. But the cost of damage to the roof from inaction is far greater than the cost of the repair. 
“It’s too bad, because the problem didn’t go away, but it’s just being ignored for a while,” Bray, the former lawmaker, said. “It’s just going to be more expensive to address for having put it off. But ultimately, unless we’re going to accept the idea that we’re going to destroy the planet on our watch, we’re going to have to do better.”

FELTON — Three years ago, Danielle Smith was driving through Elkton, Maryland, when she saw something that caused her to hit her brakes: a father playing with his young son on a sad excuse for a playground, all faded plastic and neglect, in a low-income apartment complex that had clearly seen better days.
For Smith, who had spent years in commercial real estate finance working for publicly traded companies, something clicked. That fleeting moment crystallized what would become her mission: creating affordable apartment communities people could be proud to call home.
“That was really the inspiration behind starting the company,” says Smith, the 35-year-old founder and sole owner of Carson Development.
Fast forward to today, and that same Elkton property has come full circle. Danielle acquired it last July and has completed a substantial rehabilitation, including a brand-new playground and basketball court. It’s a poetic closing of the loop that represents everything her company stands for.
Before launching Carson Development, Smith had climbed the ladder to become director of finance for the publicly held Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, handling acquisitions, dispositions, and financing for regional malls. Prior to that, she managed similar functions for grocery and Walmart-anchored shopping centers for the Kronke Group in Missouri.
The pivot required new thinking, especially when it came to funding a startup in a capital-intensive industry. Her advice to aspiring entrepreneurs is blunt: “However long of a runway you think you need, double it and however much capital you think you need, quadruple it, and then just hang on and you’ll be okay.”
She learned this lesson the hard way. Her initial cash projections were off by about 400%, she admits with a laugh. “Everything, if I look back to 2021 and 2022, even where I thought our projects would be, I was very wrong,” she admits with a wry laugh.
Take something as seemingly straightforward as letters of credit. “I was used to working for an organization where you could just call the bank and get an unsecured letter of credit,” Smith explains. As a small business owner, however, she suddenly needed 100% security behind every financial instrument — cash reserves she hadn’t anticipated needing.
“Things that I didn’t think would require capital all of a sudden became very large and real numbers,” she says. “That was cash that I had never foreseen being required to complete a project.”
Smith didn’t jump in blind. She created a financial three-legged stool: personal savings, a personal line of credit, and term loans from friends and family who believed in her vision. For years before taking the plunge, she moonlighted as a student of the low-income tax credit program, squirreling away money.
“Prepare. And then when you make the leap, be in a hundred percent,” she advises aspiring entrepreneurs. “Commit yourself to that. Whether that’s time with your family or a lifestyle that you once had, there’s a lot of sacrifices that go into that.”
When she finally launched Carson Development in January 2021, one of her first priorities was building the right team. By May, she’d hired experienced multi-family developer Max Friedman.
The financial high wire act nearly came crashing down when her company was closing on its first Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project in Maryland. State officials raised concerns about Carson Development’s experience and qualifications, suggesting they bring in a more established developer as a partner.
“At that point, I am all in — hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. I’ve maxed out my credit line. I haven’t paid myself in two years,” Smith recalls. “I remember feeling like I could not stomach the idea of everything that I had put into this and all the hard work that my team had put in and part of our fee or control going to someone who hadn’t done anything.”
That moment crystallized her realization that her risk tolerance was higher than most. “With small-business owners, I think sometimes people forget that you personally guarantee everything and there’s a risk that goes with that,” she says.
Fortunately, they were able to close as the sole developer, but the experience was humbling. During such challenging moments, she finds strength in her company’s namesake.
“The company is named after my 5-year-old son Carson,” she says, her expression softening. “And his name on the door is what gets me through those moments that you feel pretty defeated as a business owner.”
Her company isn’t a one-trick pony. Smith’s portfolio spans both affordable housing (serving populations at 80% or below of area median income) and what she calls “workforce housing”  (serving those at 80-120% of area median income) across Delaware and Maryland. They’re juggling acquisition-rehab projects like the one in Elkton and ground-up construction like the Reese Apartments in Felton — two three-story garden-style buildings with 24 units each.
The Felton location wasn’t chosen randomly. Smith explains that Delaware State Housing Authority uses a points system for its competitive funding process and Felton sits squarely in what bureaucrats call an “area of opportunity” — essentially the state’s way of waving a flag saying “build here please.”
“We are a small company competing against more established development companies who have a lot more capital,” Smith explains. “I know that I cannot possibly fund land in some areas of New Castle County or parts of Sussex County. I would love to be able to develop in Eastern Sussex County; unfortunately we just aren’t quite there yet. But that’s not to say we won’t be there very soon.”
As a woman in a male-dominated industry, Smith has faced her share of assumptions. “The only time I really feel it is the first time I meet someone. They usually don’t realize that I own the company,” she says. “But once we start working together, it’s been pretty seamless.”
The confidence that now radiates from her didn’t materialize overnight. “First, I was very insecure about it, but now I’ve realized that that was something that was within me,” she reflects. “Being confident and knowing that we have a great team, we know what we’re doing, I deserve a seat at this table, and I’m not one to sit silently.”
What sets Smith’s approach apart from many developers is her personal involvement. She walks through every unit in properties her company acquires. She attends community events and participates in construction punch list walkthroughs.
Finding the sweet spot between big-picture vision and nitty-gritty execution remains her ongoing challenge. “We are very much still in the startup phase, and I find myself sometimes getting in the weeds,” Smith admits. “I have to remember that I need to delegate tasks and give my staff the space they need to do what they do best.”
She makes design decisions based on her own experiences as a mother, like adding washer-dryer hookups in units even when it increases costs without adding points in competitive state funding applications.
“I know we can’t afford washer-dryer in units. That is not going to happen in our budget,” Smith explains. “However, I can afford to put the hookups in the unit. I’m not receiving any points from the state on our competitive application, there was no advantage to doing that. It’s just increasing construction costs.”
But Smith isn’t driven by spreadsheet logic alone. “I remember having a young baby who in the middle of the night, onesies are coming off, and walking to a laundry facility just isn’t really practical.
“I want someone to be able to drive into one of our communities and not know it’s affordable housing,” she says.
The former finance executives has undergone her own internal renovation when it comes to defining success. “When I first started, I thought success would be defined by my balance sheet,” she says. “What I’ve learned is that it’s more through impact… seeing a family who was struggling to find housing and we’ve been able to house them in one of our communities or drastically increasing the quality of life for a family through our rehabs.
The impact has exceeded her expectations. “When I first started, I don’t think I realized just how much this would change the lives for certain people or just how much me putting the work in or putting the focus on a particular community can change that community,” she says.
Smith has been called “an unusually involved owner who cares a lot” — a badge she wears proudly. Carson sometimes joins her at work sites, donning his construction hard hat and  helping clean his mom clean units with his mini-Swiffer.
As Carson Development continues to grow, Smith remains focused on investing in her team through compensation, education, and leadership. “Investing in your core team is, I think, the number one priority,” she says.
That impact has come full circle in Elkton, where a father and son (or mother and child) can now play on a brand-new playground — one built by a developer who saw not just dilapidated property, but a community worth investing in.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-30-at-10.02.10-AM.png,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

Hepper has resigned from Beneficient rather than subject himself to questioning about business transactions involving Beneficient. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The CEO of financial services firm Beneficient resigned rather than face questions by attorneys about accounting problems at the company, whose holdings include a Kansas bank charter that exempts dealings from regulatory oversight.
Brad Heppner’s departure from the Dallas-based company he founded reinforced concerns that Beneficient could collapse and break its commitment to provide financial support to the development of rural Kansas communities.
A Beneficient filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission included a copy of an email sent by a law firm representing Heppner that said he was stepping down June 19 as CEO and board chairman. The SEC document said Heppner refused an interview request from lawyers hired by Beneficient’s audit committee. The filing, posted Wednesday, also said Heppner declined to transfer control of preferred stock in Beneficient and to surrender shareholder voting rights to company stock.
Heppner’s resignation email said Beneficient managers pressured Heppner to resign by threatening to publicly disclose that he didn’t want to answer questions about his financial past.
In addition, the email said, Heppner was convinced it might be prudent to shut down Beneficient.
“Mr. Heppner believes that the only viable course for the company at this point is an orderly wind down of operations,” the email said.
Heppner was the face of Beneficient in the years since Kansas issued a banking charter to a Beneficient subsidiary. The charter allowed Beneficient to broaden the reach of a business in which it exchanged cash or stock for high-value illiquid assets, such as venture capital or private equity. Photos and video of Heppner now have been scrubbed from Beneficient’s website.
Heppner was a divisive figure in Kansas politics, with some lawmakers optimistic about the state reaping financial benefits from the company’s expansion and other legislators skeptical about the company and its executives.
“This is an embarrassment to the state of Kansas,” said Rep. John Carmichael, a Wichita Democrat who opposed granting Beneficient special business status in Kansas. “The whole house of cards is rapidly falling down. I hope, at some point, there is an accounting from the members of the state Legislature who were asleep at the wheel.”

Big promises, questions
The Republican-controlled Legislature, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and residents of Heppner’s hometown of Hesston were convinced to invest political capital in the potential of Beneficient making a fortune from deals with big-time investors eager to swap their illiquid assets for stock or cash. The key incentive was that Beneficient would funnel a percentage of that fortune to rural communities like Hesston in the form of economic development grants.
Bipartisan legislation signed by the governor guaranteed Beneficient a coveted Kansas banking charter that exempted the company from standard state regulatory supervision, including fundamental “safety and soundness” principles. In Kansas, the Office of the State Bank Commissioner is responsible for issuing charters, or business licenses, enabling companies to make loans and provide other financial services. Kansas’ stamp of approval was important because Beneficient could present the charter as evidence of legitimacy to potential clients.
Heppner joined with Kansas political allies to successfully promote the idea they were on the verge of creating an asset-swap industry that would be the envy of other states.
In 2022, Heppner said the juggernaut would be so successful that 50 copycat companies would be operating in Kansas within two years. Other than Beneficient’s own subsidiary, no such companies exist.
Hesston Rep. Stephen Owens, a Republican who was at the forefront of Beneficient’s lobbying campaign to land a Kansas bank charter, said up to $1 billion would flow through Kansas within a decade via investors from California, Florida, Hong Kong, Russia and elsewhere. Owens, now a member of the Kansas Senate, speculated that Beneficient’s activities would cause millions of dollars to be earmarked for economic development in Kansas, with a sizable chunk directed to revitalizing Hesston.
Four years into this unprecedented public-private alliance, Beneficient’s prosperity gospel has been tarnished by fallout from the bankruptcy of Beneficient’s former parent company, lengthy federal investigations, a dizzying number of lawsuits, cratering of Beneficient’s stock price, layoffs involving dozens of employees, talk of Beneficient eventually descending into insolvency and, now, Heppner’s exit.
“I’m told they are on the verge of collapse,” said Cody Morton, a former Beneficient financial services professional among one-time employees who prevailed in Texas wage disputes against Beneficient. “I think Kansas is going to look stupid.”
Morton said he raised concerns about allegedly improper business practices with supervisors at Beneficient before resigning. He said he was among former Beneficient employees who spoke with the FBI about the company.
Kansas Rep. Rui Xu, a Democrat from Westwood, said he wasn’t concerned the state of Kansas would be financially liable if Beneficient’s business collapsed in Texas. Heppner and his backers in the Legislature said Beneficient’s collapse wouldn’t leave Kansas holding a damaged subsidiary. In fact, Heppner told lawmakers: “The regulator would not need to step in ever and oversee a failing institution.”
However, Xu said that wasn’t sufficient to quell his interest in what options would be available to the Kansas banking commissioner if Beneficient faltered.
“Do you have the ability to dissolve the charter?” Xu asked.
His question has no clear answer because Beneficient lobbyists successfully blocked inclusion in state law of an exit plan if calamity struck.
State banking commissioner David Herndon’s staff pressed lawmakers to create a plan of action in case Beneficient or its subsidiary, Beneficient Fiduciary Financial, faltered. He repeatedly warned the Legislature to strengthen regulatory oversight of Beneficient’s operations in Kansas.
“Exempting any regulated financial institution from the banking code in essence allows that financial institution to claim it is regulated but not actually be regulated,” Herndon said.
In frustration, Herndon recommended repeal of the state law authorizing Beneficient’s subsidiary to possess the bank charter.

Stock price collapse
Derek Fletcher, Beneficient’s chief fiduciary officer and president, said in an interview before Heppner’s resignation that it would be wrong to read too much into persistently negative publicity about Beneficient and its corporate leadership.
“I know a lot of folks in Kansas are concerned,” Fletcher said. “We’re optimistic about Beneficient.”
He said there was no threat to Beneficient’s economic development commitments to Kansans, specifically a promise to build a grocery store in Hesston.
“They’re not dependent on Beneficient continuing as an operating company,” Fletcher said.
Beneficient’s stock price, trading under the ticker BENF, topped $660 per share when the company was taken public less than two years ago. Its value on Nasdaq plunged to a new low of 26 cents per share June 24, but had hovered around 33 cents per share since March. At the close of Friday, BENF was trading at 29 cents per share.
Fletcher said Beneficient joined Nasdaq as a publicly traded company during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for GWG Holdings, which was Beneficient’s former parent company. The 2022 bankruptcy included allegations Heppner and others operated GWG as a Ponzi scheme and stripped GWG of cash to the betterment of Beneficient. GWG’s bankruptcy trustees have clawed back tens of millions of dollars from those responsible for the bankruptcy, which left GWG shareholders with potential losses of more than $1.5 billion.
In March, Beneficient settled with GWG’s plaintiffs for $50.5 million to be paid from a corporate insurance policy. That agreement didn’t require admission of wrongdoing. Plaintiffs who purchased GWG bonds could expect to receive $31 for every $1,000 invested in GWG — or 3 cents on the dollar — under this payment from Beneficient.
“We’ve had to dedicate a lot of time and resources to that matter,” Fletcher said. “Getting that behind us in a favorable way, which we believe this would do, allows us to completely focus 100% of our effort and our resources on growing and building the business.”
The Dallas Business Journal reported Beneficient’s stock performed the worst among 119 publicly traded companies in the Dallas-Fort Worth area during the first half of 2024. In April 2024, Beneficent responded with an 80-to-1 reverse stock split to convert every 80 shares to a single share. The transaction allowed Beneficient to avoid the ignominy of being delisted by Nasdaq.
In November, Heppner used a visit to Topeka to inform the Legislature that election of President Donald Trump could ignite interest in U.S. mergers and acquisitions and prompt a surge in demand for asset-swap deals capable of being handled by Beneficient.
“Beneficient is perfectly situated to provide the earlier liquidity from those alternative assets,” Heppner said.
Nasdaq notified Beneficient a month later the company would be held accountable for failing to comply with a requirement that its Class A common stock price hold at $1 or higher for at least 10 consecutive business days. Beneficient was given until mid-July to meet the price criterion or again face dismissal from Nasdaq.
Beneficient recently disclosed to the SEC that an ouster from Nasdaq and exclusion from a supplemental exchange could make it “extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares.”
 
‘Not a dollar’
Morton, the former Beneficient financial services professional, left the company after more than three years without thousands of dollars in bonus compensation that was owed to him.
Morton filed a claim with the Texas Workforce Commission that resulted in an order concluding Beneficient executives “acted in bad faith” and were obligated to make good on unpaid earnings to Morton. The commission declared Beneficient violated the Texas Labor Code and instructed the company to pay a $1,000 administrative penalty.
Morton, who obtained an $88,540 judgment against Beneficient, has yet to be paid despite months of legal proceedings. 
“If they choose not to pay these wage claims … then that is downright loathsome,” Morton said. “When I joined the Beneficient Company, I thought I was joining my dream job. I was wrong. The worst place I’ve ever worked. It was a fantasy land.”
Some of his former Beneficient colleagues faced similar situations.
“There’s a lot of frustration on our side,” said former Beneficient employee Nick Anderson, who hasn’t received any of the $73,000 he said the state workforce commission determined he was owed by Beneficient.
The experience of battling Beneficient management about bonuses promised in writing by a company executive was so ugly some former employees declined to be publicly identified as claimants.
“We, as a company, don’t believe these claims are valid obligations,” Fletcher, Beneficient’s president, said in an interview. “As a public company, we have a duty to our shareholders to really defend the company.”
Fletcher said he would put the number of Beneficient wage claims at one-half dozen.

‘Special place’
The image of a company dodging pledges made to their own personnel stood in contrast to the vision of wealth development articulated by Heppner and Fletcher, as well as state politicians and lobbyists, who pitched the bank charter idea four years ago. Beneficient gained political leverage by pouring tens of thousands of dollars into Kansas Republican and Democratic PACs in addition to individual contributions to politicians. That includes $15,000 to both the Democratic and Republican state parties. The Democratic governor’s reelection campaign got $30,000, while Derek Schmidt, the attorney general and GOP candidate for governor, took in $24,000.
Lt. Gov. David Toland, who also serves as secretary of the Kansas Department of Commerce, testified to the Legislature that the business pitch by Beneficient produced this initial reaction: “Sounds amazing, but what is the catch?” Toland said the state agency vetted Beneficient’s proposed bill and concluded it was a “unique opportunity to assemble the first comprehensive statute that makes it possible for us to welcome” Beneficient and comparable alternative asset companies to Kansas.
Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican from Andover, used his influence at the Capitol to usher the legislation forward. He issued a letter that declared a series of lawsuits tied to Heppner or Beneficient were inconsequential to development of the company’s business model in Kansas.
A unanimous Kansas Senate and a bipartisan coalition of 103 Kansas House members bought into the idea of awarding Beneficient Fiduciary Financial a charter under a pilot project exempting it from some regulations applied to traditional banks and trusts. Kelly, the governor, signed that measure in 2021 and a subsequent bill making the charter permanent.
In 2022, Heppner confidently told lawmakers Beneficient was on the cusp of expanding its work with wealthy individuals or financial institutions eager to unlock the value of illiquid assets. The model would deliver prosperity from Heppner’s office on North Saint Paul Street in Dallas to Main Street in Hesston, he said.
“My hometown of Hesston holds a very special place in my heart,” Heppner said. “Years of underinvestment has seen our Main Street shutter key shops and businesses.”
Heppner predicted a proliferation of similar Kansas-chartered companies would follow in Beneficient’s footsteps. By law in Kansas, they would be known as a TEFFI, or Technology Enabled Fiduciary Financial Institution.
After nearly four years, Beneficient stands as Kansas’ lone TEFFI. State officials say they’re unaware of any other TEFFIs in the United States.
The promise Beneficient building an alternative asset empire, with Kansas as a hub in that world, has been tempered by harsh realities. In 2023, the company laid off about 45 employees. There was an SEC investigation of Beneficient, which began in 2021 and reportedly closed in 2024. Former employees of Beneficient said agents of the FBI interviewed them, but the status of that inquiry was unknown.

‘What’s going on?’
El Dorado Republican Sen. Michael Fagg said the value of seed money generated by Beneficient for economic growth shouldn’t be dismissed by critics. He said the company’s commitment to revitalizing Hesston was extraordinary.
“We wouldn’t have any of this,” he said. “We’re trying to promote a new idea.”
Whenever alternative assets were placed with Beneficient, state law says, 2.5% of financing for the deals had to be funneled to a Kansas economic development fund.
The statute also said the Department of Commerce would receive $250,000 of the $1 million in regulatory fees Beneficient annually paid to the State Banking Commission. The annual payment would be assessed June 30 with payment due July 15.
Beneficient’s TEFFI, so far, provided more than $3 million for economic development grants to 90 projects statewide. In January, the Department of Commerce allocated $22,500 grants to a dozen entities, including the Haskell Township Library. Grants for “community vibrancy” projects were made to Neodesha, Conway Springs and Burrton. Each required a 10% local match.
If Beneficient folded, however, the annual revenue for economic development projects would vaporize.
Beneficient has yet to deliver on the central trickle-down promise made to the 3,400 residents of Hesston — construction of a grocery store in town. A potential retail operator was identified and work to acquire property has been ongoing. Four years into the partnership with Beneficient, the company’s president wouldn’t commit to a deadline for the store’s opening.
“The challenge is that not all that is visible. It really presents questions of, ‘What’s going on?’ ” Fletcher said.
During the 2025 legislative session, Beneficient sought greater regulatory liberties, including an exemption on lending limits. House Bill 2235 stalled, suggesting shine may be wearing off the TEFFI experiment.
Democratic Rep. Virgil Weigel of Topeka said he questioned the viability of Beneficient’s strategy as far back as 2021, when he was one of 20 legislators to vote against the TEFFI Act. Controversy that followed Beneficient all the way into 2025 affirmed that assessment, he said.
“I was very skeptical with the whole thing,” Weigel said. “Quite frankly, I haven’t heard anything that has changed my mind.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heppner16x9crop-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

(Getty Images)Four unvaccinated Kentuckians have contracted the highly contagious measles, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) announced Friday. 
Three of the four cases were from the same household in Woodford County and the fourth, unrelated to the others, is in a Todd County person who was exposed while traveling internationally, the cabinet said. 
Kentucky has now reported six cases this year amid a decline in routine preventative vaccinations. None of the four had been vaccinated against measles, the cabinet said. 
Measles is extremely contagious and is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect nine in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. 
“Measles is a serious disease,” Dr. Steven Stack, the public health commissioner and newly-appointed cabinet secretary, said in a statement. “Fortunately, people can avoid measles through safe and effective vaccinations. We urge all parents to have their children vaccinated to ensure they are protected from preventable diseases like measles.”

GUEST

Michelle Wu



THE JOB OF mayor often comes with bright lights, with the city as the stage. 
That’s confirmed by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s schedule – which in one day may include a coffee hour with constituents in South Boston, a GBH studio appearance in Back Bay and a Battle of Bunker Hill remembrance in Charlestown. Exposure like that is a big advantage for any elected official seeking another term, as she is attempting to fend off a challenge from nonprofit executive Josh Kraft. (CommonWealth Beacon has reached out to the Kraft campaign to invite him on The Codcast.) 
But Wu is also a self-described introvert. She didn’t get into the grip-and-grin tumult that defines city politics until after she arrived in the Boston area for college more than 20 years ago. She ran for City Council in 2013, and once in office, built towards a run for mayor. 
In that first campaign trail for her as a candidate, she ended up losing her voice by election day in 2013. “It was because in that year I probably had spoken more words than in all of the other years of my life combined, just campaigning and going around,” she said during a recently taped interview on The Codcast. 
“I definitely have had to really learn how to feel more comfortable doing public speaking, seem more comfortable doing public speaking, but a lot of it is practice,” she said. “And a lot of it is just feeling really excited about others, say, in the neighborhoods and in the people that I get to meet on a day-to-day basis.” 
Wu also discussed why she enrolled as a Democrat, and how she interprets recent polling showing that while New England voters are unhappy with the Trump administration, they’re even more upset with Democrats.  
“It’s not about a particular party or affiliation, but it’s things aren’t great right now, and there are reminders of that all around every single day … and we all need a reason to have hope,” she said. “We all need proof that forward momentum is still possible. And I think city government has a really key role to play in that, because this is still the level of government where you can get things done, where people can still come together across differences.” 
During the episode, Wu also talked about her first politically-tinged event (4:15), whether super PACs should exist (23:30), and her media diet (30:40).

(Photo provided by SC DMV)COLUMBIA — Sitting inside a South Carolina’s drivers’ licensing office to await your turn could become a thing of the past.
The budget that takes effect Tuesday allows the state Department of Motor Vehicles to begin raising the money it needs to upgrade software systems that are roughly three decades old.
DMV Director Kevin Shwedo said he doesn’t know of any state in the nation other than South Carolina still operating on a system developed in the ‘90s. But that’s about to change over the next five years as the DMV prepares for a nearly $100 million overhaul.
Leaders of SC courts, DMV warn what could happen if ‘ancient’ technology isn’t upgraded

Shwedo, who’s led the agency since 2011, warned legislators earlier this year that putting off upgrades could have dire consequences.
Wait times could soar again, he said, reminding legislators of the four-hour waits before the current computer system went live statewide in 2002. (Reducing the lines became part of then-GOP-nominee Mark Sanford’s winning campaign to oust Gov. Jim Hodges that year.)
And some of South Carolinians’ most sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, birth certificates, passport numbers, marriage licenses, and divorce papers, could be targeted by hackers.
The Legislature agreed, giving the DMV the OK to increase document fees by $4 and raise the necessary funding to build and maintain a new system expected to last two to three decades.
What’s next?
Shwedo points to South Carolina’s population growth over his tenure, from 4.6 million in 2010 to an estimated 5.5 million in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Yet the number of people working for the DMV statewide has changed little since it became a stand-alone agency in 2003, when Sanford signed the DMV Reform Act.
That leaves the agency turning to technology to make up the difference, transferring more services online to meet demands.
The DMV’s goal for wait times inside its branches is under 20 minutes. But actual waits vary. People are encouraged to check online for the number of people in queue and wait times at their local branch. At the Shop Road location in Columbia, for example, the maximum posted wait Monday morning was 25 minutes.
The upgrades should allow for most services to be done online, negating the need to come in at all, Shwedo said.
“We want to transition from ancient technology to one that will bring the DMV into your home,” Shwedo said. “I don’t want you to come to the DMV any more than you want to be there, which means I want to create more opportunities for you to interface with the DMV online. This technology will allow us to get there.”
Shwedo envisions a security system that verifies residents’ identity by tracking and identifying phone numbers when people come in or multi-factor identification when they sign in through the DMV website.
SC DMV announces new security features for licenses. They’ll arrive via mail.

He also hopes to install kiosks in county tax offices, so when people pay their property taxes they can print out their new registration on the spot.
Finally, the state is working on a virtual driver’s license and ID card, one that can be linked with other state licenses people may hold, such as a hunting and fishing license or a concealed carry permit.
A big expense
The problem is it’s a lengthy and expensive project.
DMV services are heavily intertwined with those of other agencies, such as taxes and probate court and insurance.
Shwedo said the agency will spend the next year contracting out the project. After that it will take two years to code driver-related information and then two more years after that for vehicle-related information.
To pay for it, the DMV is bumping up fees for things such as vehicle history records, accident reports and copies of traffic tickets from $6 to $10. It marks the first time in more than 40 years that these fees have increased. It also puts South Carolina more in line with fees charged in other Southern states.
The agency anticipates it will raise an extra $12 million annually.
It has $44 million available to get started. That includes $26 million the Legislature set aside for the project in the last two budgets: $6 million in one-time aid last year and $20 million in 2023. The DMV has additionally squirreled away about $18 million through fees.
After the upgrade is complete, the additional fees will cover the system’s annual maintenance costs.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCDMV-Orleans-File-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

(Photo by Eric Pilgrim/U.S. Army)In a few days, the Howard County Council will have the opportunity to do something utterly sensible, at little or no cost to anyone: Discourage the use of a product that is demonstrably climate-changing, wildly unhealthy, increasingly expensive and occasionally blows up.
Too good to be true?  Not at all.
To achieve all that public good, all the council needs to do is amend the county building code to discourage new homes and buildings from burning methane (so-called “natural”) gas indoors. It shouldn’t even be a controversial idea.
But sadly it is. For nearly a century, the gas industry has bamboozled Americans into believing that burning this dangerous product is benign. Around 1940, a former employee of the American Gas Association gave the phrase “now you’re cooking with gas” to comedian Bob Hope, who then made it famous. In the 1970s, the AGA sponsored Julia Child’s TV cooking show featuring a gas stove and oven and made sure viewers knew it.
The often-seen phrases “natural gas” and “clean burning” are deceptive marketing tropes for a highly refined product whose burning causes immense damage to the climate.

Even as the scientific evidence of global climate disruption gets more frightening, big gas continues its decades-long campaign of confusion, much as the cigarette industry had done earlier. A chilling 1998 action plan from an American Petroleum Institute communications team makes the strategy clear: “Victory Will Be Achieved When … average citizens ‘understand’ (recognize) uncertainties in climate science.”
If you don’t care about the planet, focus on your family’s health. For decades, scientists have known that burning gas indoors causes respiratory harm, especially in kids.
The venerable American Lung Association recently told this to a federal agency: “Gas stove exposure can worsen asthma symptoms, wheezing, and result in reduced lung function in children and other vulnerable populations, particularly in the absence of ventilation and for children living with existing asthma or allergies. Additionally … research has established that exposure to pollutants emitted from a gas stove and other gas-powered appliances contributes to a variety of diseases including heart disease and stroke, asthma, COPD, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes, premature birth and respiratory infection.”
That’s just awful.
To top it off, burning methane gas in your home is increasingly expensive. A Maryland state agency has published an analysis showing that, within a few years, BGE customers’ monthly winter gas bills will grow to as much as FIVE TIMES what they are now, not because of the commodity price, but because BGE’s monopoly business model allows it to overhaul its ancient underground pipe system and bill gas customers for all its costs and profits.
Unsurprisingly, both the health harms and the skyrocketing gas bills fall hardest on the least well-off. Elected officials in Howard County and elsewhere strive to build affordable housing, but consigning residents of that housing to lifetimes of compromised health and unpayable utility bills is just a horrible idea.
Given the wide availability of efficient, cost-effective electric alternatives for heat, hot water and cooking, discouraging the use of this dreadful product in new homes and other buildings is a modest, reasonable policy step. Why wouldn’t any responsible government do it?
Public confusion, but also intimidating political and legal pushback.
Gas and building industry executives hire powerful lobbyists, and make corporate and PAC contributions, to preserve the status quo. Last year in Annapolis, more than 50 professional lobbyists were arrayed against the Better Buildings Act, which was similar to what the Howard County Council is considering now. Several industry groups, led by the National Association of Homebuilders, have sued both Montgomery County and Washington, D.C., for enacting bills to discourage methane in new buildings, part of a national legal strategy to prevent change.
Back in Howard County, dozens of concerned residents have attended recent council meetings to urge it to discourage gas in new homes and other buildings. Several have compellingly testified. A letter signed by 25 organizations, as well as a petition from 130 high school students, urged the council to act. Even so, it will take political courage for our small county council to slow down climate change, improve children’s health, lower many residents’ utility bills and promote social justice.
But Howard County has a thoughtful, progressive governing tradition, and there appear to be council members willing to resist the pressure. They can improve life for Howard County residents while showing Maryland and the nation how to promote the public good over special interests. If they do it, they deserve to be both celebrated and emulated by other state and local lawmakers.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5588392-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 10:12:08.091144

(Photo from Alaska Department of Public Safety)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.



We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Find out what happened to three men who were arrested in California and deported. Also: Marines at the border, the political and economic toll of the immigration raids and why Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News. 

After the arrest: In the past few weeks, federal immigration enforcement agents have rounded up 1,600 people — most of whom have no criminal conviction — during raids in Los Angeles County. CalMatters spoke to three people who were detained during the first weekend of the raids and deported to Mexico. Their reports suggest that agents are working under a new playbook that enables them to make arrests using dubious pretexts, and encourages agents to push people to sign removal forms before speaking with an attorney. Mauricio Oropeza, who has no criminal record, was detained while waiting at a bus stop after work. He was then shackled in chains and driven to an ICE tent camp in Texas. There, he signed voluntary removal forms before finally being allowed to make his first call to his family. Learn more about what happened to Oropeza and other immigrants like him from CalMatters’ reporters. 


Marines on the border: Dozens of Marines have been stationed at a Border Patrol station located in eastern San Diego County. Previously, the armed forces were kept away from civilian law enforcement, so this move signals a change in both how the Marines operate and President Donald Trump’s border strategy. A spokesperson for Newsom’s office said the Marines’ presence represents “mission creep.” Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.


Population shrink: During Trump’s first term, California’s population declined in part due to his administration’s policies that made it harder for foreign workers to enter the country. Now the state is bracing for a similar hit with his return, as deportations and limits to U.S. entry threaten the state’s economy and Electoral College clout. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn. 


Newsom sues Fox: On Friday the governor filed a lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the network of lying about the date Newsom last spoke with Trump on the phone, and for claiming the governor is lying about a call related to Trump’s deployment of federal troops in L.A.

CA braces for new fuel standard


Gas prices at a station in Victorville on May 19, 2025. Photo by Rene Ray De La Cruz, Daily Press via Reuters




The California Air Resources Board’s new rules for fuel standards take effect Tuesday. These rules aim to reduce air pollution but are controversial because they could also raise gas prices, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
The updated standard is expected to reduce carbon dioxide-equivalent gasses by an amount equal to the emissions of more than 120 million cars on average in a year, according to the air board. Gas prices aren’t expected to rise immediately due to the new rules, and it’s unclear whether they will since it depends on how much the oil industry passes costs onto customers when it buys credits. 
But when the fuel standard was last updated in 2011, a gallon of gas rose by an additional 9 cents. This update could add 5 to 8 cents per gallon, according to a UC Davis researcher.
Republicans have slammed the fuel rules, arguing that they would make the state even less affordable. GOP state Senate leader Brian Jones of San Diego called the standard, “nothing short of price gouging by Newsom.”

SEIU Local 1000, the union that represents state custodians, alleged in a complaint to the State Personnel Board that the contract between PRIDE and the California Medical Facility prison at Vacaville violated guarantees that those job positions be filled by union employees.
After multiple short-term contract extensions, the PRIDE contract ends July 1. Disabled environmental service technicians will work their last shifts inside the prison, clock out and walk to their vehicles unemployed.
The state posted multiple job openings for custodians at the prison earlier this month.
PRIDE claims their lost job positions will ultimately be filled by incarcerated Prison Industry Authority workers — and not SEIU members as intended. Prison officials said they wouldn’t comment, and neither would the state human resources department.
Heather Dunn, who has worked at Vacaville for more than five years, doesn’t know what the future holds or where her next job might be. As a 38-year-old single mom, she worries for her 2-year-old son. “He still needs the things that he needs. It’s going to be really hard to provide for him,” she said.

Dunn: “Before I came to PRIDE, it was very hard for me to keep and to find a job due to my reading disability.”

Ameer Habeeb, a 52-year-old service-disabled Air Force veteran, works with Dunn and will lose his position as an environmental services director. 

Habeeb: “PRIDE’s given me the opportunity to be accommodated and given me opportunities where I’ve been able to grow.”

PRIDE workers continue to plead with state legislators and Newsom to step in and help them keep their jobs.
Democratic Assemblymember Lori Wilson of Suisun City has a bill in the works to create pathways for disabled workers to be brought into the union so they can be included in state contracts.

(Photo courtesy of New Energy Equities)The Legislature passed a bipartisan energy bill during the special session June 9 without two provisions that Minnesota solar power advocates said would have threatened thousands of local jobs and limited consumer choice as the state transitions to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. 
“At the end of the day, clean energy goals don’t really mean anything if you don’t have a solar industry to develop projects,” said Logan O’Grady, executive director of the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association. 
Supporters of the discarded measures to sunset Minnesota’s popular community solar gardens program and reduce utility payments to rural and small-town solar customers said they were needed to keep power affordable during the clean power transition.
“These provisions are birds of a feather that both attempt to reduce the cost ratepayers pay for clean energy,” said Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato, chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities, Environment, and Climate Committee and chief Senate author of the 2023 clean power law. 
Frentz did not directly commit to bring up the measures again next session. But his committee “will do the same thing that I think all committees should do, looking at where we are as a state and deciding what we should prioritize,” he said. 
Earlier this year, Frentz’s committee voted 9-2 to advance a version of the 2025 energy omnibus with the net metering and community solar changes. A House version that did not include those provisions ultimately won out in special session negotiations.
Under current Minnesota law, community solar subscribers — including residential customers as well as businesses, nonprofits and government entities — pay solar garden operators a discounted rate for the power produced by their shares in the small arrays that dot fields and roofs around the state. They receive corresponding utility bill credits that can significantly reduce or offset the cost of electricity supplied by the utility.
The community solar program has grown dramatically since its 2014 launch, meaning Xcel Energy now pays subscribers hundreds of millions of dollars in credits annually. After years of legal wrangling, state regulators last year reduced the value of those credits in a move they said would save Xcel Energy up to $41 million per year. The ruling also expanded community solar eligibility to Minnesota customers outside Xcel territory.
Without the proposed changes, the average residential Xcel customer would have paid $7 per month in 2024 to support community solar subscribers, the Star Tribune reported. In 2023, Xcel estimated that community solar represented 20.5% of its electric fuel costs while providing about 3.8% of its electricity in Minnesota.
Frentz said this “cost shift” unfairly burdens regular utility ratepayers to benefit community solar subscribers, who make up a small minority of all Minnesota customers. A similar dynamic plays out between customers with onsite solar arrays, which receive “net metering” payments from local utilities that are generally much higher than the price utilities pay for power, he said.
“It’s around twice the cost that is then passed onto (customers) who did not agree to it and for the most part did not know about it,” Frentz said. 
Solar proponents say that’s not the full picture.
The cost shift is a “myth,” said Bobby King, Minnesota executive director for Solar United Neighbors, pointing to a 2024 Minnesota Department of Commerce study that said community solar would deliver nearly $3 billion in net benefits over 30 years.
In any case, last year’s Minnesota Public Utility Commission ruling and state legislation passed in 2023 went a long way toward addressing calls to reform the program, O’Grady said. 
The legislation, in particular, represented a hard-fought compromise between the solar industry and Minnesota utilities, ratepayer advocates and other groups, he said. It shifted responsibility for the program from Xcel to the Minnesota Department of Commerce; set declining annual caps on new statewide community solar capacity; significantly increased the maximum size of individual installations; and established carveouts for low- and moderate-income subscribers.
“The changes the Senate wanted to see already happened,” O’Grady said. “We didn’t love them all, but we agreed to them because we heard the message that they were needed.”
Further changes to community solar and net metering would constrain customer choice for customers who want alternatives to their local utility, he added. Reducing net metering payments lengthens the payback period for people who install solar on their properties, making those investments less appealing. 
Frentz argued this session’s debate was about leveling the playing field for all clean electricity sources in all parts of the state, rather than continuing to put a thumb on the scale for smaller-scale solar installations that today mostly serve Xcel customers. The promise of fairness and flexibility helped quell rural electric cooperatives’ and municipal utilities’ opposition to the 2023 carbon-free power law, he said.
Right now, the lowest-cost path to a carbon-free grid involves lots of large-scale wind, solar and battery power. But that could change as technological breakthroughs drive down the cost of other forms of power, like geothermal, Frentz said.
“Flexibility is the selling point,” he said.
Another threat: Republicans in Washington
Whether that flexible clean energy future comes to pass in time for Minnesota’s 2040 deadline depends to some extent on what happens in Washington, D.C. this summer. 
On May 22, the Republican-controlled House passed a sweeping budget that would rapidly phase out federal tax credits for wind, solar, geothermal and other carbon-free power sources. President Donald Trump urged the Senate “as soon as possible” to ratify the bill, which independent analyses say could dramatically reduce new clean energy deployments and add $33 billion to consumers’ annual energy bills by 2035.
Days later, Trump took executive action to force at least two aging, expensive coal- and oil-fired power plants to remain open past their scheduled retirement date, citing the “national energy emergency” he declared in the opening hours of his second term. 
If enacted, the Republican budget “would eviscerate our industry…we could see 75% of our members go out of business or get acquired by others,” O’Grady said. “To me, this is an anti-jobs bill.”
O’Grady’s focus right now is “putting names to faces” for GOP legislators whose votes could be decisive. A meeting between staff from top-ranking House Republican Rep. Tom Emmer and a dozen MnSEIA members representing about 2,000 jobs was cause for cautious optimism, and MnSEIA is encouraging members who do business in other GOP-leaning areas to engage with local representatives, O’Grady said.
No matter how the federal fight turns out, Minnesota’s solar industry is gearing up for another state policy bout in 2026.
“We fully anticipate this issue will be brought up next year and we will fight it,” O’Grady said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Long-Lake-CSG-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

No immediate hike in California gas prices will occur but Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature fear the effects of the clean-fuel program.


California’s revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard takes effect on Tuesday, despite fierce Republican criticism and increasing Democratic trepidation over its potential to raise gas prices.
The new rules — which expand a program to reduce climate-warming gases and clean the air  — ratchet up requirements for cleaner fuels and broaden a $2 billion credit market aimed at cutting emissions from cars, trucks and freight.
No immediate hike in gas prices will occur. Experts say the future impact is uncertain because it depends on how much the oil industry spends on buying credits and then passes it onto consumers.
The previous fuel standard, which was set in 2011, added 9 cents to the cost of a gallon; a UC Davis researcher estimates that the new one could add 5 to 8 cents per gallon.
The Newsom administration is bracing for more political attacks as Republican legislators have seized on the issue. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office issued a fact-check memo defending the rule and saying the impacts are exaggerated, while Republicans in the Legislature and Congress say it would damage the economy because Californians already pay the most in the nation for gasoline. State Sen. Brian Jones requested an audit of the rule, calling it “nothing short of price gouging by Newsom, hitting Californians where it hurts the most.”
Democratic lawmakers last week introduced legislation that would cap the price of the standard’s fuel credits in an effort to rein in price spikes at the pump. The measure is supported by one of the state’s most powerful Democrats, Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, who said it “will reduce costs for drivers across the Golden State while continuing to move our climate and energy goals full steam ahead.”
The new fuel standard is projected to reduce carbon dioxide-equivalent gases by 558 million metric tons through 2046, according to the air board’s economic assessment. Those reductions are equal to the emissions of more than 120 million cars on average in a year.  Some critics say that is an overestimate, because soybean fuels may not be as clean as reported.
Cleaner, low-carbon fuels include biofuels made from soybeans or cow manure. The program has been particularly successful in reducing the diesel fuels used by medium and heavy-duty trucks. Over the 13 years, it has displaced 25 billion gallons of petroleum fuels, according to the air board.
The new fuel standard was temporarily delayed earlier this year when the state’s administrative law office rejected it and sent it back to the air board to add more clarity to the rule. 
Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat, last month called for the resignation of California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph over concerns that the agency did not study the economic impacts of its new standard.
Randolph said in a statement that gas prices are “over a dollar per gallon cheaper than just a few years ago. Our efforts to deploy more zero-emission vehicles and reduce fossil fuel use is working to cut demand and create more competition in the fuels market, and the (fuel standard) is a big part of that effort.” 
In an unrelated action, California’s gasoline excise tax, which is adjusted annually, will increase by 1.6 cents per gallon on Tuesday. The tax is primarily used to pay for roads and highways.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/052925-Gas-Prices-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

Gavin Newsom’s office is making benefit deals with public employee unions that save money today in part by putting off payments that were meant to bring down costs tomorrow.

Gavin Newsom’s office is making benefit deals with public employee unions that save money today in part by putting off payments that were meant to bring down costs tomorrow.
His office this month negotiated seven agreements with unions that pause state spending for two years toward one of California’s largest long-term debts: the health care benefits civil servants receive in retirement. 
Newsom’s pause on the pre-funding payments for current workers has the potential to free up a lot of money. His office in May estimated those payments would cost the state more than $700 million in the new budget year.
But the promise to workers is massive: At the last official estimate, California would need $85 billion to pay for the retirement health care benefits it has promised to state employees. 
The governor’s move to suspend payments toward future retiree health care coincides with another big concession he’s asking from unions as he manages a $12 billion deficit. The new contracts include furloughs that trim take-home pay for public employees over the next two years and essentially negate the raises state workers are getting this year.
But six of the proposed labor agreements have a sweetener to ease the pain of the furloughs. 
Like the state, workers represented by those unions won’t have to pay anything toward their retirement health care for the next two years. Suspending that deduction puts between 1.7% and 4.5% of their earnings back into their paychecks. 
“For my members, the cost of living in the state is so high, it just gives them a little bit of relief in putting money in their pockets that wouldn’t be there otherwise,” said Ted Toppin, the executive director of the union that represents state engineers, Professional Engineers in California Government.
Service Employees International Union Local 1000, which represents about 100,000 California civil servants, announced Sunday that it also made a new labor agreement with the Newsom administration that gives workers a break on the retirement health care deduction for two years. Neither the union nor the state have said yet whether the agreement pauses what the state was supposed to pay for that benefit.
“This will boost take home pay,” the union said in its message to members.
Newsom’s predecessor, former Gov. Jerry Brown, created the plan to pre-fund retiree health care benefits by having both the state and employees chip in money every paycheck. He insisted on it in difficult labor negotiations that resulted in unions agreeing to what was then a new paycheck deduction.
Until then, California had paid for the retiree health care exclusively through the state general fund. Brown and others were concerned that the pay-as-you-go practice would eat up larger and larger slices of state spending because of the rising costs of health care.
This year, California expects to spend $3 billion on the health benefits its already-retired civil servants will use, up from $1.6 billion in the 2016-17 budget year.
The state calls that other post-employment benefits, or OBEB, meaning benefits in addition to pensions.
Over time, the contracts Brown negotiated would gradually create a trust fund for retiree health care and remove that expense from the pot of money the state uses for general government services. On the current timeline, that would happen some time in the late 2040s.
Toppin, who was involved in the Brown-era contract negotiations, said the state has flexibility to manage its goal for retiree health benefits.
“This is a long horizon,” he said. “At least for the state in this year and the near term the need is deficit reduction, and for my members the need is they gotta pay the bills.”
But it also comes with long-term risk and likely will delay the state’s plan to stop paying for retiree health care out of the general fund, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. 
“Suspending the state’s contribution to prefund (retiree health care) reduces costs today but contributes to a significant and growing unfunded liability and creates risk that the benefit will not be fully funded” by the state’s target date, legislative analyst Nick Schroeder wrote in an assessment of Newsom contract with the union that represents correctional officers.
The state expects to save about $100 million a year from the prison guard contract alone by suspending its payments toward correctional officers’ retirement health care.
Newsom previously allowed state workers to skip their paycheck deduction for retiree health care early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when his office negotiated labor agreements that included furloughs because of fears that the virus would trigger a painful recession. The state restored the money in the 2021-22 budget.
“The state remains committed to pre-funding retiree health,” said Camille Travis, the spokesperson for the state human resources department, in a written statement. “The suspension of contributions to the retiree health trust will help address the budget shortfall in the near term.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

(Photo courtesy of Tim Peterson, flown by Lighthawk)The U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture recently announced it would try to roll back the “roadless rule,” a decades-old policy that prevents road construction and logging on nearly 4 million acres of national forest in Utah. 
Brooke Rollins, the department’s secretary, called the rule “overly restrictive” and an “absurd obstacle” to forest management when she made the announcement during a Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico. The rule, she said, prohibits agencies from properly managing forests and preventing wildfire, while stifling the timber industry. 
Utah leaders celebrated the decision, with House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, calling it a “big win” for the state. 
But in Utah, proponents of the rule say it’s a vital tool for protecting the state’s forests, which in turn keep water clean, provide habitat for wildlife and allow recreation opportunities. 
“This rule protects almost half of the forest service land in Utah,” said Kate Groetzinger, communications director for the Center for Western Priorities. “This opens about half of Utah’s forest land to logging that has been previously protected. That can drastically change the feel of some of our most popular forests.” 
The scope of the roadless rule in Utah 
The roadless rule was established during the Clinton administration in 2001 and restricts road construction and reconstruction, and timber harvests, on roughly 58.5 million acres of the country’s national forests and grasslands. The goal, according to the forest service, “is to provide lasting protection” on some of the country’s most remote areas.  
Called inventoried roadless areas, the forest service created boundaries around roads and existing infrastructure to identify stretches of forest eligible for more stringent protection. Inventoried roadless areas are typically sorted into two categories — places where road construction or reconstruction is allowed, and places where it isn’t allowed. 
There are roadless areas along the Wasatch Front, in places like Big, Little, Millcreek and American Fork canyons; in vast sections of the Uinta Mountains; in southern Utah, near Moab and Monticello. They can be recreation hotspots, with some of the state’s most popular hiking trails on or near roadless areas.

Utah has roughly 8.1 million acres of national forest, according to the federal government, spread out across eight regions — Ashley, Caribou, Dixie, Fishlake, Manti-La Sal, Sawtooth, Uinta and Wasatch-Cache national forests. 
According to forest service data, about 4 million acres is inventoried roadless area — road construction and reconstruction is allowed on about 3.5 million acres, and prohibited on the remaining 446,000 acres. 
But according to Tim Peterson, the cultural landscapes director for Grand Canyon Trust, the distinction can be misleading. 
“We haven’t built a lot of new roads in our national forests over the last two to three decades,” said Peterson, who’s been involved in Utah’s roadless areas since the 1990s and helped conduct inventories for environmental groups. “Road building is so expensive and the forest service already has a maintenance backlog … we can’t even maintain the roads that we have, let alone build new roads.” 
Regardless of whether new road construction is or isn’t allowed, the rule generally prohibits timber harvesting in covered areas. There are exceptions, Peterson said, including mechanical thinning, removing trees killed by insects, or for fighting fire. 
In an email, Redge Johnson, the director of the Utah Public Land Policy Coordinating Office, acknowledged the exceptions, but said the state is still confined in its ability to manage forests to improve habitat and reduce fire danger.
“While the roadless rule allows for limited timber harvest it has so many restrictions it makes it nearly impossible for timber projects to be completed,” Johnson said. “Our forests are overgrown and unhealthy, it is past time that we start to actively manage our national forests.” 
Johnson shared a picture with Utah News Dispatch that he took while on a recent horsepacking trip through the Manti-La Sal National Forest, that shows an entire ridge with mostly dead coniferous trees. 
“Even though there are old logging roads on the ridge shown, we can not use them to remove the dead timber due to the restrictions from the roadless rule. Removing this dead timber would reduce wildfire risk, increase wildlife habitat and protect our watersheds,” Johnson said.

What’s next? 
Despite Rollins’ announcement, the federal government still needs to go through a formal process to rescind the roadless rule. 
That includes preparation of an environmental analysis, making sure the action complies with the Endangered Species Act, and consulting with local governments and tribes, according to the forest service. 
Johnson called Rollins’ announcement a first step. 
“Our office is awaiting more information on what the process will entail,” he said. 
Peterson noted that the Trump administration isn’t the first to try and rescind the rule. 
“It’s much more complicated than just saying you’re going to get rid of it,” he said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In 2005, the Bush administration tried to replace the it with the State Petitions Rule, which allowed governors to tailor their own national forest protections. Some states submitted plans that aligned with the original protections — others, like Idaho, asked for drastically reduced protections. 
The Bush administration’s rule was challenged in court and ultimately overturned.
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert also tried to petition the government for a Utah-specific roadless rule in 2019, which was ultimately unsuccessful. 
What to expect if the roadless rule is rescinded 
Assuming the administration is able to scale back the rule, there would be 4 million extra acres of forest service land in Utah that would be open for timber harvesting — the state says that would allow for increased wildfire mitigation and forest management. 
“We are excited with this new direction by the United States Department of Agriculture,  allowing the federal government, state partners and industry to address a variety of forest health and ecosystem services issues, like water quality/quantity, wildlife, forage and air quality,” said Johnson. “We are looking forward to engaging with the Trump Administration, USDA, and the Forest Service to promote healthy, diverse and productive forests here in Utah and across the country.” 
Rollins, in a recent op-ed for the Deseret News, said to date about 8 million acres of roadless forest around the country have burned in wildfire, and rescinding the rule would free up forest managers who she argues are constrained by the rule. 
The USDA also said rescinding the rule will help boost the state’s economy. 
“Utah alone estimates the roadless rule alone creates a 25% decrease in economic development in the forestry sector,” reads a press release from the department. 
Advocates for the rule, however, are skeptical. According to an analysis from the forest service, the roadless rule has led to an estimated reduction of just 59 jobs related to timber harvesting in Utah and Peterson said the logging industry in the state was never that robust to begin with.  
“There has never really been a huge timber industry in Utah,” he said, “and getting rid of the roadless area rule would not make for a big timber industry in Utah, because roads are so expensive to build.” 
If the forest service is serious about expanding timber harvesting, he said, it’s going to need a bigger budget. The agency’s deferred maintenance backlog for roads and bridges was estimated at $4.4 billion in 2022 and the president’s budget proposal would slash millions from forest service operations. 
“If we’re going to be building roads and doing timber sales, it’s not reflected in the budget that the administration has put forward to Congress,” Peterson said.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Powell-Point-in-Table-Cliffs-Henderson-Canyon-IRA-Dixie-NF-c-Tim-Peterson-Lighthawk-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

“We are currently awaiting the required list of nominations from the speaker, pro tem and lieutenant governor for this appointment,” a spokesperson from the Governor’s Office said.
Gwathney declined comment on Tuesday. She will continue serving as a member of the parole board until the governor’s office submits another candidate to replace her.

The former prosecutor’s six-year term overseeing the board has been controversial. Parole grants plummeted into the single digits during her term, though they have grown in recent years. Critics have laid much of the blame for declining parole rates at Gwathney’s feet. The board’s delays in updating parole guidelines drew sharp criticism from Democratic and Republican lawmakers, who made the board’s funding for 2026 contingent on the board drafting them.
“I don’t think there is a word that adequately describes how badly the last six years have been in terms of what the law was, what the goals were, and how, I am pretty sure, under her leadership, the parole board missed almost every one of those goals,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a longtime critic of both Gwathney and the current parole process.
“If there is a checklist out there for what is necessary to lose your job, I believe Leigh Gwathney hit every one of them,” he added.
New laws, declining numbers
Gwathney assumed office in 2019 after the Legislature approved an overhaul of the board. The move came after Jimmy O’Neal Spencer, was mistakenly released from prison in 2017. The following year, he murdered three people in Guntersville, including a seven-year-old child, during a series of robberies. A jury convicted Spencer of capital murder and sentenced him to death in 2022.
The 2019 law created a director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles and provided stricter rules for granting applicants parole, especially if they committed a violent crime. The legislation also established guidelines that would recommend if applicants should be granted parole or be denied.
The law required the parole board to update the guidelines every three years based on data to grant parole to applicants who are the least likely to be a threat to public safety.

The parole rate has declined dramatically since Gwathney was appointed to lead the parole board. According to data obtained from the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, the parole rate was 55% for 2017 before steadily declining for the next several years.
It was 53% in 2018, one year after Spencer murdered three individuals after earning release. It declined again in 2019 to 31%, to 20% in 2020, 15% in 2021, 10% in 2022 before reaching its lowest point to 8% in 2023. For 2025, the rate increased to 26%.
Matthew Mangino, a former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania who served for six years on the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, said in an interview that parole helps people transition from prison back into their community.
“It helps those individuals with re-entry skills, whether it is dealing with their criminal conduct in the past, finding a skill, or continuing rehabilitation or treatment,” he said. “And it is also an opportunity to monitor these people while they are on the streets to ensure they are not violating the technical aspects of their release or involved in other criminal activity.”
Criminal justice reform advocates said Alabama’s parole board made decisions that did not comply with established guidelines.
According to a September 2024 monthly statistical report, the guidelines recommended that 83% of applicants be granted parole for that fiscal year but the grant rate was 20%. That results in a conformance rate, the frequency with which the parole board follows its own guidelines, of 25% for that fiscal year.
For 2023, the guidelines recommended that 81% of applicants be granted parole while the board only granted parole in 10% of the cases, a conformance rate of 12%.
Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization, said the “unfortunate result” of the decline in paroles was that “more people are leaving prison at the end of their sentences with little or no parole supervision, which generally does not correlate with increased public safety.”
“The supervision and programming that comes from someone being granted parole generally means more services and more accountability for people leaving Alabama’s prisons,” she said. “A strong parole program with reasonable grant rates can contribute to public safety. Thousands of people exiting prisons, often after decades of living in violent, chaotic surroundings, with no supervision or programming generally does not.”

Some lawmakers also expressed concerns regarding the parole board’s decisions and the impact it has on the criminal justice system writ large, but especially on the violence and overcrowding within Alabama’s prisons.
“I am a second-chance person,” said Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro. “I believe that people deserve a second chance. And, at the end of the day, these people are going to get out at some point, whether they are going to EOS out, end of sentence, or they are going to die there. They are going to be released at some point in time. And so, I think when you continue to just deny people, deny people, when they have done everything that you have asked of them to do, it sends a bad message.”

Frustrations over guidelines

Some lawmakers have been increasingly frustrated with Gwathney and the parole board. Their frustrations culminated at a Joint Prison Oversight Committee meeting in October, when Gwathney gave what legislators considered evasive answers to direct questions.
Singleton said during an interview last week that he understood the difficulties of the job but that Gwathney and the parole board had not met his expectations.
“In the past, we have tried to get information, and we have not gotten the information,” Singleton said on Wednesday. “And when we have gotten information, it was misleading information.”
England was even more critical, accusing Gwathney of violating the law after the board went two years without updating parole guidelinesThe parole board in May proposed guidelines that will be submitted to public review, but England expressed doubts about their quality.
“It has been six years now, and what we have essentially done is waste time, a lot of money, and resources,” England said in an interview Wednesday. “Which includes changing guidelines and score sheets, depending on who was in front of her, so all that data is corrupted.”
Pennsylvania relied on guidelines to make parole decisions, Mangino said.
“We had the same numerical score that came from this guidelines process that would say whether someone was likely successful on parole or not,” he said. “You look at the crime, whether the defendant has taken responsibility for that criminal responsibility, you look at the actuarial tools as an aid to tell you what sort of risk, what sort of level of treatment someone might need, what medical health issues they have to deal with on the street.”
He also said that the state’s department of corrections would issue a recommendation for the parole board to consider.
“If you were going to go against the guidelines, you had to provide a written reason why you deviated from the guidelines,” Mangino said.
England has proposed legislation aimed at reforming the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles that would incorporate some of the factors Mangino used to guide his decisions.
The proposals included a validated risk assessment to guide parole decisions and to weigh whether a parole applicant is eligible for work release according to the Alabama Department of Corrections as factors for deciding parole. England also proposed legislation that requires members of the parole board to justify their decisions when they deviate from parole guidelines and allow applicants who have been denied parole to appeal their decisions to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.
Thus far, the bills have failed to pass the Legislature.

‘I don’t want to weigh in on that’

State senators who would approve the candidate for the board, whether Gwathney or someone else, declined to comment on her potential candidacy.
“I don’t want to weigh in on that,” said Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, last week.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, said that he would consider her if Gwathney is the nominee.
“I think she has done a pretty good job, pretty adequate,” he said. “I know she is criticized for not granting more paroles, but then again, not many of us are looking at the records either.”
Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, who publicly criticized Gwathney during the October meeting, said last week he was not willing to comment.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_016-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

The order put some universities on their heels, with Michigan State University abruptly canceling a Lunar New Year celebration due to the executive orders, later rescheduling the event following backlash from students. 
In the months since, the administration has issued a “Dear Colleague” letter providing educational institutions from pre-schools to universities with a Feb. 28 deadline to dispense with their diversity programs at risk of losing federal funding, arguing that these programs are discriminatory. 
Many colleges ignored the president’s demands, with the President of Western Michigan University instructing the campus to “please proceed as usual” according to a report from the Associated Press. 
In service of this decree, the United States Department of Education launched investigations into several universities across the country over race-based programming, opening investigations into Grand Valley State University and the University of Michigan on March 14. 
Less than two weeks later, the University of Michigan announced it would shutter its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Office for Health Equity and Inclusion, while halting its DEI 2.0 Strategic Plan.

Some public universities pull back on Juneteenth festivities
Juneteenth, celebrated annually on June 19, commemorates the date in 1865 when union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas and announced more than 250,000 enslaved Black people were free by executive decree. While the Emancipation Proclamation had taken effect more than two and half years prior, the order was not implemented in several places under Confederate control.
Juneteenth has been a federal holiday since 2021, and was celebrated in Michigan as an official state holiday for the first time in 2024. Although many state universities held panel discussions, showed documentaries, held workshops and spotlighted Black-owned businesses, there was a noticeable pull back among some universities this year, who either downsized from previous celebrations, or opted against celebrations entirely. 
While Northern Michigan University led festivities for the first time, and scheduled celebrations at Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Central Michigan University, Eastern Michigan University and Grand Valley State University looked similar to – or built upon – prior events, the University of Michigan’s celebration was notably smaller this year. 
In years past, the University’s Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives held a multi-day “Juneteenth Symposium” which included panel discussions, artistic performances and a Juneteenth Block Party in 2024. This year’s event was instead hosted by the University of Michigan Detroit Center, and featured two speakers focused on community resilience and local advocacy.

Brendan Kirwin, a spokesperson for the Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives, confirmed that they would not be hosting the symposium in 2025. When asked why the office had opted against hosting the event this year, Kirwin said the office was making some changes to its focus, and other offices the university is stepping into for the time being to assist.  
Juneteenth celebrations at Western Michigan University have looked different year to year, with the Black Graduate Student Association co-hosting events in 2021 leading up to, on and following the holiday. In 2022, the association hosted a Juneteenth Gala, while the university’s Merze Tate College hosted a Juneteenth cookout in 2023 and 2024. 
However in 2025, no events were listed on the university calendar. In a June 17 email, Paula Davis, Western Michigan’s associate vice president for strategic communications, said she did not know if the university was hosting any events. In a follow up email on June 20, Davis said as far as she knew, no events had been held or were planned. 
Michigan Technological University leadership in April discussed a number of policy changes brought on by the executive orders, including phasing out the Center for Diversity and Inclusion and moving its staff to new roles at the Center for Student Support and Mentorship. According to the Daily Mining Gazette, Vice President of Student Affairs Laura Bulleit assured panel attendees that Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth celebrations will still take place as long as they remain federal holidays.
While the university held events commemorating Juneteenth in 2023 and 2024, none were listed on the university’s event calendar for this year. University communications did not respond to multiple emails asking whether the university had any celebrations planned.

Part of a national trend
Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education said their members had seen a “troubling” trend of institutions scaling back or entirely eliminating academic or social support programs, including celebratory events. 
As far as why universities are scaling back, Granberry Russell referenced the demonization of the DEI acronym by conservatives and pointed to comments Trump made on Juneteenth where he declared in a post to his social media site that the nation has “too many non-working holidays.”
“Why choose Juneteenth, you know? And we’ll see if, if there’s something akin to that, if the Fourth of July falls on what is otherwise a working day,” Granberry Russell said. “I doubt very seriously that there will be criticism leveled against the Fourth of July as Independence Day.”
As part of the dilemma for universities concerning Trump’s executive orders, Granberry Russell noted the orders refer to programs such as “illegal DEI” and “radical and wasteful DEI” without offering any definition. 
The association, with the American Association of University Professors and other groups, is challenging those orders in court, arguing they unlawfully restrict speech, exceed presidential authority, and obstruct Congress’ constitutional power over government funding.
“The executive orders that we have challenged, for example, by President Trump, are intentionally vague and misleading, and I think as a result you’re leaving institutions in a state of ambiguity,” Granberry Russell said.
The executive orders, as well as prior anti-diversity initiative laws implemented in various states and others that have been introduced, are making it difficult for universities to determine what is permissible and what may trigger a lawsuit, Granberry Russell said.
While federal holidays serve as an opportunity to celebrate and commemorate events such as the end of slavery in the United States, that designation can also be seen as permission for universities to mark an event without a threat of that event being categorized as an illegal or wasteful DEI effort, Granberry Russell said.

However, celebrations can be held as a token gesture rather than an authentic acknowledgement, which is sometimes the case with federal holidays, Granberry Russell said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion programming and policies, alongside university celebrations, are a way of honoring the lived experiences and contributions different identity groups or communities have made to our democracy, Granberry Russell noted.
However, the pushback against these policies has isolated certain lived experiences based on gender, race or sexuality, deeming them wasteful or radical, Granberry Russell said.
She noted that it required the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the country to begin to move toward fairness and equal opportunity, Title IX to acknowledge that gender should not be a barrier to opportunities and pointed to the Americans With Disabilities Act as another law aiming to remove barriers and protect disabled individuals.
“These laws and celebrations and acknowledgements are intended to say, more broadly, you belong here. You are welcome here. We’re going to remove barriers and obstacles to your lived experiences. You should have the right to excel on your merit. That’s what this is all about,” Granberry Russell said.
While things may have started with opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, the outrage has extended far beyond those programs, calling the value of higher education into question, Granberry Russell said.
Eliminating programming that honors communities whose contributions were often left out of history is not a neutral step, and can be interpreted as forgetting about the contributions and sacrifices these communities have made, Granberry Russell said.
“We do have to ask ourselves, in higher education, what kind of learning community we cultivate when we choose silence over celebration?… This is not progress and it is not honoring the history and the lived experiences of those who have contributed to this country,” Granberry Russell said.

In NAACP v. Alabama, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the state could not compel the NAACP to release its membership lists. 
The lawsuit arose out of a lawsuit filed by Alabama Attorney General John M. Patterson, who claimed the civil rights organization had harmed the state’s reputation by promoting the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the admission of Autherine Lucy to the University of Alabama. 
Justices wrote that requiring the NAACP to turn over membership lists would violate the First Amendment, which promises the freedom of association. 
“It is hardly a novel perception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute as effective a restraint on freedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action,” the justices wrote. In the past, such exposures had led to members suffering “economic reprisals, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion and other manifestations of public hostility,” the justices wrote. 
The ruling proved a great victory for the civil rights organization, which enabled it to continue operating in Alabama.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06130723/Rosa-Parks.jpg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

But I’ve spent my adult life watching American presidents try to bomb the region into peace. It never works.
Which leaves me wondering how Alabama’s senators, who on paper have better sources than us Goat Hill wretches, think that President Donald Trump’s decision to attack Iranian nuclear facilities solved anything.
“President Trump is going to win the Nobel Peace Prize, no doubt,” U.S. Sen. Katie Britt said on Fox News last week. “He has brought peace to a region that needed stability.”
The bombs were still falling as Britt spoke.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“President Trump blew the hell out of them,” said Britt’s colleague, U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, on another Fox News network that same day. “And it’s obvious that that worked.”
That’s not at all obvious, actually. But it’s not international affairs that concern me here.
These are two of the most powerful people in the nation, with a responsibility to our state and an unparalleled opportunity to improve the lives of nearly 5.2 million Alabamians.
And what are they doing with that power?
Debasing themselves in public worship of a man with a bottomless sense of victimhood and a thoroughly selfish view of the world and those in it.
Of course, it’s no secret that Britt, Tuberville and almost every Alabama Republican gush over Trump and attack his enemies with the fervor of a Justin Bieber fan on Twitter in 2009. The median Republican position is that the president is infallible in word and deed.
That belief means embracing Trump’s fantasies. And prioritizing them over the needs of Alabama.
It’s not just Tuberville praising a military deployment against largely peaceful protestors holding “non-American flags.” Or Britt cheering as Trump attacks the federal department that feeds a lot of children in poverty in Alabama.
Just look at this congressional budget bill, looming over us like an avalanche.
They call it the “big beautiful bill” because Republicans never contest Trump’s perceptions of reality. Big, certainly, but not beautiful. The legislation contains provisions that are likely to do major damage to health care in the state and make it harder for hundreds of thousands of Alabamians to get food.
Tuberville has expressed some mild concern over cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the bill, less for the effect it could have on 752,000 Alabamians who depend on it for food than the costs Trump has proposed shifting to state government, which Tuberville would like to lead in about two years. Britt on Sunday said that would encourage states to put “skin in the game.” I don’t think a Legislature that refused federal aid to expand Medicaid can be trusted to do what Washington won’t.
But neither Tuberville nor Britt appear overly concerned over the bill’s broader rollback of health care provisions. The legislation proposes cutting over $820 million in state funding for Medicaid, which covers about 20% of Alabama’s population, most of them children, the elderly or those with disabilities.
That will curtail health care access, particularly in rural areas where hospitals are already struggling to survive and health care providers are few and far between. Nor does the bill extend enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of the year that give 170,000 Alabamians access to Affordable Care Act plans. All of this will mean less preventive care; sicker people; more emergency room visits, and greater strain on state hospitals.
The administration is also cutting billions of dollars in grants from the National Institutes of Health, money that supports institutions like the University of Alabama Birmingham, the state’s largest employer. Britt has signaled some unease about that, but the most she’s done is get HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — not someone whose word can be trusted — to mildly praise the work done at UAB. The administration shows no signs of backing off the cuts.
Neither Britt nor Tuberville seem interested in confronting Trump over any of this. Their priority is keeping the president happy. Tuberville even adopts Trump’s dehumanizing rhetoric about immigrants.
But the president is never happy. His re-election campaign ran on conspiracy and fear-mongering. Trump sees invisible cabals out to get him at every corner. He posts angry screeds at the slightest criticism. And he surrounds himself with flatterers who only speak in superlatives.
Our senators have joined this fawning choir. At our expense.
They’ve made Trump’s priorities — the ceaseless aggrandizement of Donald Trump — their own. Our senators have little to show for their time in office than an affirmation of the president’s paranoia and delusions.
So we get U.S. senators calling a man who unleashed bombs a peacemaker. Who shrug as he plans a major assault on Alabama’s well-being.
But no praise chorus can reverse the reality of the suffering the bill will unleash. Or erase the memory of who was responsible.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Katie-Britt-Tommy-Tuberville-composite-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

HB 178, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, and SB 166, sponsored by Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, would have required public K-12 schools to display an 11-by-14-inch poster of the Ten Commandments in common areas and classrooms where American history is taught.
The House passed its version of the bill 81-11 on April 22, but it never received a final vote from the Senate. Kelley said in an interview Wednesday that he and Gidley will bring the legislation back next year as is.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I wished we could have gotten it through the legislature this past session,” Kelley said. “I think we had reached a point where we would have accomplished that.”
Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays. Federal courts have allowed the displays of the Ten Commandments in historical contexts in schools but not as religious or moral displays.
The Louisiana Legislature passed a law in 2024 which, unlike the bills in the Alabama Legislature, required the document to be displayed in all classrooms. A federal court ruled last week that the law is unconstitutional, and violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, prohibiting the government from establishing a state religion or favoring one religion over another.
Despite the difference in the Alabama law, senior counsel Keisha Russell with the First Liberty Institute, a law firm that specializes in “defending religious freedom,” said that if the bill passes next year, it will still be challenged in court and likely deemed unconstitutional. She said in an interview Wednesday that whatever happens to a potential Alabama law will depend on what happens with the Louisiana law.
“I think it’s going to rise or fall based on what happens in this particular case with Louisiana, because the bills are pretty similar no matter what,” she said.
Kelley said he is not worried about an Alabama law being challenged in court, mostly because his legislation does not mandate the display in every classroom and because the intent is the historical context of the biblical text.
“I think ours is sticking with historical content, and so I think we’ll be fine with what we put together and the changes that we’ve made,” Kelley said.
A’Niya Robinson, policy and organizing director of the Alabama American Civil Liberties Union, said the ACLU has been opposed to the legislation from the beginning. She said that because the Ten Commandments is derived from religious text, it is inherently religious, not historical.
“I think that’s a really interesting argument to make, to allege that a document that has text that’s found in the Bible, in some folks’ Bible, is supposedly not religious,” Robinson said in an interview Thursday. 
Russell said that requiring the text to be displayed where history is taught would require the text to be in every elementary school classroom and some middle and high school classrooms.
“It’s still going to be virtually everywhere, right? Common areas, lunchrooms, all of that,” Russell said. “I think there’s a better argument to say you’re going to put it in all the classrooms than to say that you’re just going to stick it in like the locker room or the lunchroom, which is a common area. To me, that has less sort of academic value than if it’s in the classroom.”
Robinson said the location of a poster does not make its presence any more constitutional.
“There is still a captive audience there,” she said. “They have to go to school, they have to be in classrooms, and they still are going to have to look and see that poster every day if this bill were to be signed into law.”
Opponents of the legislation argued during public hearings that the version of the Ten Commandments in the bill combines multiple versions of the text and is not historical.
“This bill is a violation of the First Amendment and imposes a certain religious understanding of a certain text that has been hodged-podged together and linguistically abused and has no place in our public schools,” Rev. Julie Conrady, a minister with the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham, said in March.
 Kelley said Wednesday that the intent of the bill was manipulated to be religious, and that his intent is solely historical and based on the founding of American law and the Constitution.
“It’s just the manipulation of what the intention is, of what the words are by others is where the conflict comes in,” he said. “Anybody that has learned history from an early age, they learned how it’s influenced us.”
Robinson said that the first amendment was inspired by the founders’ belief that religion should be separate from government.
“If we want to talk about historical importance, then I think it’s important to go back to the founders’ original intent,” she said. “There’s so many different versions of the Ten Commandments depending on what particular faith or translation you subscribe to. So by only posting one version of the Ten Commandments in classrooms, then really you could say that politicians have crafted their own version of the Ten Commandments, and they’re trying to impose it on public school students throughout Alabama.”

Wes Moore is ambextrous must come in handy. Here he is signing with his left hand in his first bill signing in 2023. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Of the 300 bills with July 1 effective dates that were signed into law this year, most attention — and aggravation — will be focused on just one, the Budget Reconciliation and Finance Act of 2025, a 200-page bill that raises $2 billion in fiscal 2026 through a combination of new taxes and spending cuts.
And most attention in the bill that goes by its shorthand, BRFA, will be focused on a new a 3% tax increase on the sale of many informational technology services, which alone is expected to raise more than $480 million in new revenue that will help the state close a $3 billion budget hole it found itself in at the start of the year.
The bill also includes new, higher income tax rates for the highest earners and allows local government to increase the amount of income tax they collect. It also includes taxes on cannabis sales, mobile sports wagering and vehicle emissions inspections, among many others.
But the bulk of the new laws are not about dollars and cents. Also starting Tuesday are changes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s decade-long education reform plan; an expansion of solar-power siting options; a sweeping Chesapeake Bay cleanup bill; and a program to allow state funds to be used for abortions for uninsured and underinsured state residents.
The taxman cometh
For the first time, technology companies will have to pay a sales tax on their services. The tax, originally proposed as a 2.5% business-t0-business tax, was expanded to a 3% on all sales, money that supporters say is needed to head off funding cuts to critical programs in the state.
But critics say the tax — expected to raise $483 million in its first year, growing to $747 million by fiscal 2030 – is a job killer that will drive businesses out of the state. In floor debate on the House floor this spring, Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), the vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, took the remarkable step of announcing that he was relocating his tech business outside the state because of the tax.
The tax will apply to a range of services: cloud storage, data entry, data processing, media streaming data storage and technical support, telephone-based recorded information services, cryptocurrency mining, news and press clipping services, media archives such as for film and music, computer software design services, and dozens more.
Comptroller’s Office issues guidance to help businesses brace for 3% ‘tech tax’

Affiliated companies would not have to pay the tax among themselves, and the law exempts emerging technology companies located in the “Discovery District” in College Park. It also exempts companies such as IonQ and companies that do business with a developer of quantum computing technology, an industry that Gov. Wes Moore (D) has targeted for development as part of his efforts to diversify the state’s economy.
The tech tax is the biggest single in the BRFA, but it’s far from the only one. The new law also:

Creates two new upper-end tax brackets and increases the tax on them from 5.75% to 6.5%, while increasing the standard deduction from $2,500 to $3,350 ($6,700 for joint filers and some others), which is expected to bring in $344 million;
Allow local governments to raise their income tax from the current maximum of 3.2% of reported state income tax — the rate currently assessed by 18 of the state’s 24 jurisdictions — to 3.3%;
Raises the tax on mobile sports wagering from 15% to 20%;
Expedites the phase-in of higher vehicle excise taxes;
Increases the cannabis sales tax from 9% to 12%;
And raises the vehicle emissions inspection fee cap from $14 to $30.

The bill also allows the imposition of a $5 fee on the sale of new tires, to help support the Transportation Trust Fund, but that tax will not be assessed until Jan. 1, 2026.
New funding for abortion grants
A new law allows the Maryland Department of Health to release millions of dollars in unspent insurance funds that it hopes to use to fund abortions for uninsured and underinsured Marylanders.
Senate Bill 848 and House Bill 930 create the Public Health Abortion Grant Program, which will be used to help cover abortion costs for uninsured or underinsured Marylanders. The grant program will use $25 million that have been collected in premium surcharges that are required as part of the federal Affordable Care Act but have not been spent down.
That money is the $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy, to fund abortion services for their policyholders. But that fund has been growing by about $3 million a year, as collections have outpaced need.
Under this law, providers will receive the grant funds for providing abortion services for people who do not have insurance or whose health insurance does not cover abortions. While the law goes into effect July, the fund to create the grant program will not be established until September.
Solar bill powers up
Beginning Tuesday, local governments will have less say in the siting of large-scale solar fields, under a law that changes how Maryland regulates solar energy sites.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The law undoes restrictive zoning laws passed in several counties and sets uniform environmental standards for solar farm construction, including rules requiring buffers of trees and shrubs, and limiting the disturbance of topsoil.
The Renewable Energy Certainty Act was part of a three-bill energy package sponsored by Democratic leadership, who said it aimed to prevent solar developers from getting caught in a confusing tangle of local regulations, and stimulate the growth of desirable renewable energy.
It passed over Republicans’ protests, particularly that the bill would leave valuable agricultural lands vulnerable to solar development. The bill does set a 5% limit on solar development in pre-existing agricultural “priority preservation areas,” but opponents argue that that percentage still has the potential to disrupt fragile local farming economies.
An effort by opponents, largely farmers, to challenge the bill by referendum fell just short of the petition signature requirement.
With the bill taking effect, many local jurisdictions are scrambling to update their regulations about solar, said Dominic Butchko, the director of intergovernmental relations at the Maryland Association of Counties, in a recent interview, checking to make sure their local laws mesh with the state’s new policy and aren’t any more restrictive.
The quick turnaround time for counties to fix their laws before the state solar bill takes effect might create some “bumps” in the road, Butchko said, but he said any loose ends are likely to be tied up in the months ahead.
“The counties can go less extreme than what was outlined in the legislation. They just can’t go more extreme, and so jurisdictions are going to have to go through the bill and just make sure that whatever they have on the books really aligns with that,” Butchko said.
The Blueprint
Three years into the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the 10-year schools education reform plan gets some tweaks in the the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, which takes effect Tuesday.
One major part of the Blueprint deals with the implementation of “collaborative time,” which provides teachers more out-of-classroom time to plan and work with each other on various subjects and also assess student achievement. School systems are supposed to start implementing collaborative time next year.
But state school leaders have said that to fully implement collaborative time, they would need to hire at least 12,000 new teachers at a time when the state faces a teacher shortage.
The law taking effect Tuesday pauses the policy requirement for collaborative time for three years, but keeps the funding amount at $163 per student for next fiscal year. It would stay at that level until fiscal 2029, when it would jump to $334 per student.
Local school officials and advocates have expressed repeated frustration in implementing the Blueprint plan. In December, the Public School Superintendents’ Association of Maryland released a report that included a recommendation to clarify roles between state Board of Education and Accountability and Implementation Board, which oversees the Blueprint. That recommendation bore fruit last week, when the two boards approved an agreement that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each.
But some Republican lawmakers and education advocates already say they are going to continue to push for more Blueprint reforms when the General Assembly returns in January.
¡Si, ellos pueden!
Thousands more Marylanders are expected to be able to take the General Educational Development test, also known as the GED, for the equivalent of a high school diploma, now that the test will be offered in Spanish as well as English.
Senate Bill 451 sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) and House Bill 325 sponsored by Del. Greg Wims (D-Montgomery) will allow individuals to take the exam at least twice a year at locations throughout the state. Wims said earlier this year Maryland was the only state to publish the test in English only.
In written testimony on the measures, the department said slightly more than 9,000 people whose primary language was Spanish enrolled in programs it offered in 2023-24. Of those individuals, approximately 4,177, or 46%, did not have a high school diploma.
The new law comes as President Donald Trump (R) has issued an executive order making English the official language of the U.S. and rescincing a 2000 executive order signed by then-President Bill Clinton (D) that directed federal agencies and organizations receiving federal funding to improve access to services for those are with limited English proficiency.
The U.S. has never had an official language, and it’s unclear what effect Trump’s order can have, absent legislation. According to a June 3 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, about 22% of people in the U.S. age 5 and older spoke a language other than English between 2017 to 2021.
The law also requires the state Department of Labor, which administers the GED tests, to study whether the test can be offered in other languages besides English and Spanish. Those recommendations must be submitted to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees by Dec. 1, 2026.
FBI funding
Speaking of pushing back against Trump, House Bill 1078 sponsored by Prince George’s Democratic Dels. Nicole Williams, Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez directs the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”
The proposed new FBI site in Greenbelt was chosen in November 2023 by the General Services Administration as the next home for the FBI headquarters and its 7,500 employees.
But on the same day the House approved the measure in March, Trump said he would stop plans to build the new FBI headquarters in Maryland, noting that it’s a blue state and claiming that the Greenbelt site is “three hours away” from the agency’s current site at 935 Pennsylvania Ave. NW in Washington. The Greenbelt site is about actually 16 miles from the D.C. location.
The GSA had two other finalists for the FBI site, one in Landover, also in Prince George’s County, and another in Springfield, Virginia.
Virginia representatives claim the process to select Maryland was flawed, especially after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process — but not with the Greenbelt site.
FBI Director Kash Patel said last month about 1,500 employees would be transferred to other locations nationwide, but did not mention a site for a new headquarters.
Young adult health care subsidies extended
Young people buying health insurance on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace will continue to see savings on their monthly premiums, thanks to the new law that eliminates the expiration date for the State-Based Young Adult Health Insurance Subsidies Pilot Program.
The current program aims to help low-income Marylanders between the ages of 18 and 37 afford individual health plans through state-funded subsidies, taking an average of $40 off of their monthly insurance premiums. Those savings range depending on the individual’s financial situation.
Officials say that the subsidies have led to an increase in enrollment from this age group, which helps create a healthier insurance pool all around and lower rates for everyone. With the new law under House Bill 297 and Senate Bill 5, those savings will be permanent, so long as the state has funding to support the subsidies.
Establishing a disability employment initiative
One of the governor’s priority bills, to help give people with disabilities greater access to employment opportunities, will launch in July.
House Bill 502 establishes the Office of Disability Employment Advancement and Policy. The new office will explore strategies to improve employment, training and care-readiness of people with disabilities.
The office will also implement the “Maryland as a Model Employer Initiative” which will help connect people with disabilities to jobs and promote career advancement for those individuals. The office will also report data on the success of those effort to the governor and the General Assembly starting next December and every year after.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC_0368-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 09:06:03.147331

Joe Lombardo made righting Nevada’s economy a focus of his gubernatorial campaign. Now, as he begins his quest for re-election in 2026, critics contend he has failed to fulfill two central promises – to make housing more affordable and to lower the unemployment rate.
Lombardo’s policies on housing and employment often appear at odds with his goals, say observers.
“He has no intention of lowering rents or increasing availability of affordable housing, and that became apparent,” says Shelbie Swartz, executive director of Battle Born Progress, pointing to Lombardo’s enlistment of a Republican lawmaker to kill a measure that would have capped corporate investment in residential housing.
On the employment front, sacked with the highest jobless rate of any state for the last year, Lombardo pursued an anti-worker agenda, critics contend, including a veto of legislation that would have required paid family and medical leave for employees of some private companies.
The governor did not respond to numerous requests for comment for this story. 
 ‘Trickle-down housing’

Of a handful of bills championed by Lombardo this year, only two passed – an education reform measure and a housing act aimed at reducing demand across the spectrum by creating a new level of subsidized housing for buyers earning up to 150% of area median income (AMI).
Subsidized housing is currently reserved for individuals earning up to 80% of AMI, and in some cases up to 120%.
“It’s kind of like a trickle-down housing policy,” says Ben Iness of the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance. “Are middle-income folks those that need support the most? Are they in dire straits compared to our low income and extremely low income residents?”
The idea behind the policy is that more market-priced, ‘attainable’ homes will free up existing units for low and extremely-low income Nevadans, who have fewer choices than low-income Americans in any other state. 
“The trickle-down theory doesn’t work,” says Las Vegan Frank Hawkins, who has built thousands of low-income and affordable units in Nevada. “It’s like saying I’m gonna give you nothing and I’m gonna give you more of it, and sooner or later, you’re gonna have something.”
Yet, Hawkins, a former Las Vegas city councilman, is excited the law facilitates construction of properties for sale, rather than for rent, and is hopeful Lombardo’s plan will spur gentrification in distressed areas such as the Historic Westside, where dozens of vacant parcels are owned by the government, even if it’s unlikely developers will pursue the opportunities. 
“Builders want to be out in the suburbs,” he said. “And they want everything to be on new streets, for new people.” 
In Clark County, where the area median income for a household of four is estimated at $75,000, a buyer earning $112,000 would be eligible for Lombardo’s plan. The threshold would be slightly higher in Washoe County, where the AMI is $83,800. 
At that income level, a prospective buyer could qualify for a home valued at roughly $460,000.
The median price of a single family home in Clark County sold in May was $480,000, up from $425,000 when Lombardo took office in January 2023. The median price of a home sold in Reno was $595,000, up from $510,000 when Lombardo took office. Rent at both ends of the state is also up from when Lombardo became governor.  
The housing act was initially slated to cost $250 million and serve 16,000 households, but was scaled back to $133 million with a goal of creating 5,000 single-family homes.
Lombardo has access to other incentives that don’t require public funding, such as inclusionary zoning, a policy that requires developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new residential developments or pay into a fund that does the same. 
As a candidate, Lombardo, a free-market enthusiast, rejected proposals such as rent stabilization and inclusionary zoning. Instead, he said he’d “provide incentives and defer payments on land” to generate more affordable housing.
Supporters of Lombardo’s legislation reject the notion that it ignores the need in low- and extremely-low income markets. Nevada has 14 units for every 100 extremely-low income residents, the lowest level in the nation. Other programs, they note, such as federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), are doing the work to develop units at the low end of the market.  
“Nevada’s housing crunch is not limited to affordable units. It is a system-wide shortfall,” says Wally Swenson of Nevada HAND, which facilitates low-income housing development. “Families at every income level are competing for too few homes, which results in rising home prices, forcing more competition for both naturally occurring and purpose-built affordable housing.”
Middle-income buyers, Swenson says, are “edging out neighbors with lower incomes.”
While housing reserved for low-income residents is essential, building at every price point, he says, “is a sustainable strategy to address the downward pressure on affordable housing and support our growing communities.”
Ennis of the NHJA questions whether federal funding for low-income housing will fall victim to President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting. “It’s hard to suggest our state is immune from what’s happening nationally.”
The LIHTC program is not currently in jeopardy, In fact, both parties have voiced support for expansion of the credits.
While housing construction lagged growth in the decade from 2010 to 2019, a surplus of units built before the Great Recession has picked up the slack, say a chorus of experts who contend the housing shortage is manufactured.  
“Unfortunately, not enough of it is affordable, especially for low-income and very low-income families and individuals,” says Kirk McClure, a Kansas University professor who co-wrote a study published in the journal Housing Policy Debate.
Affordability challenges, he says, are a result of low incomes versus high housing prices, rather than a shortage.
“This condition suggests that we cannot build our way to housing affordability,” he says. “We need to address price levels and income levels to help low-income households afford the housing that already exists, rather than increasing the supply in the hope that prices will subside.”
Iness of NHJA agrees. Absent solutions for low wages, tenant protections, measures to keep rents in check, enforced habitability standards, and controls on corporate purchases of residential units, Lombardo’s policy, he says, seems superficial. 
 Giving away the house

Builders, who learned they can make higher profits by selling fewer homes, are not building much, and when they do, it’s not the multifamily units that are desperately needed, especially in Southern Nevada. In 2023, Reno and Sparks issued 15% more multi-family building permits than Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas combined, reports the Guinn Center for Policy Priorities.
Thanks to inflation, the high cost of capital, and the cost of materials, “a lot of projects just don’t pencil in anymore,” says Nicholas Irwin, research director at UNLV’s Lied Institute. “On those lower-income projects, the capital financing is just not there, or the cost of construction is just so high. Given a choice with a piece of land, developers know if they can get more of an upper-end of market distribution, that’s their target.”
Whether Lombardo’s effort frees up units that can be filled by low-income earners remains to be seen, says Irwin. “Whenever you expand eligibility, those programs are going to help get more people into housing. We don’t know if it’s going to be the people at the very low or upper distribution of that spread.”
Subsidies for affordable housing are designed to solve the resulting math problem when development doesn’t add up. Gap financing, low-income housing tax credits and other subsidies guarantee the project and its resulting below-market rents won’t be a drain on developers.
Until recently, such programs have been reserved for critical efforts to provide units for low and extremely low-income residents, who are often seniors and others on fixed incomes.
“What we’re seeing now is the markets underproviding middle-income housing as well,” says Irwin. “We need to build more housing of all types.” 
Irwin notes other states are using public money to incentivize developers. Colorado lawmakers are shoveling public money into housing projects targeting households earning as much $170,000 a year, the Colorado Sun reports. 
Legislative insiders suggest that politics, not policy, is the impetus for Lombardo’s housing gamble, which enhances the governor’s bona fides with voters, apart from any ties that may bind him to Trump.
He is expected to face off against Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat.
Six of eight Republican state senators voted against Lombardo’s housing bill, which had widespread support from Democratic lawmakers and passed unanimously in the Assembly.
 ‘An unusual twist’

On the campaign trail in 2022, Lombardo blamed then-Gov. Steve Sisolak for the state’s unemployment rate, and suggested it was under the governor’s control. 
Under Lombardo, the state has led all others with the highest unemployment rate in the nation for the last year, and the job growth rate is the fourth lowest in the nation. 
In his 2025 State of the State address, the governor noted that under his watch, a record 1.6 million Nevadans are on the job. “But in an unusual twist, Nevada’s unemployment rate stands at 5.7 percent – a number that reminds us there is still much work to be done.”
Lombardo acknowledges that, for the most part, his initiatives are intended to appeal to employers, not to the workers he seeks to enlist.
“Nevada has long prided itself on maintaining a business-friendly environment,” Lombardo said in his veto message of a bill that would have required businesses with more than 50 employees to provide 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. Current law requires 8 weeks of PFML leave, but only for state employees.
In two legislative sessions and in public appearances, Lombardo has eschewed worker-friendly policies, such as prevailing wage, a provision initially exempted from his housing bill, and he’s laid the blame for the state’s jobless rate on its residents.
‘We’re number one in job availability, but we’re number one in unemployment, you know why? Because they’re not quality jobs,” he said at a Republican gathering this year. “People would rather manipulate the government process and receive unemployment or to sit at home versus occupying a job that’s available that doesn’t see their family moving forward.”
Lombardo’s economic development bill contained a rare pro-worker initiative that would have provided transferable tax credits to help finance a new or expanding child care facility for up to five years. It went nowhere in Carson City.
His efforts to diversify the economy have “brought $5 billion in economic development into the state,” he told a Republican gathering in April. His Office of Economic Development notes 41 companies have made $6.7 billion in capital investment during his term. More than half of the investment – $3.6 billion – is from Tesla, Inc., which had a footprint in the state before Lombardo took office.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NZ65871-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

But what does that phrase mean?","On May 30, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a list of over 500 cities, counties and states it designated as “sanctuary” jurisdictions. The state of Connecticut itself, plus six of its towns, were on the now-deleted list.
Some local representatives were surprised to see their municipalities on the list. Others were not.
The term “sanctuary city” is controversial because it has no official legal definition, but it generally refers to jurisdictions limiting their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.  
Here’s what you need to know about sanctuary cities and Connecticut officials’ reaction to the DHS designation.
What are sanctuary cities?
According to Global Refuge, a nonprofit that helps people settle in the U.S., sanctuary cities have policies that set boundaries on what information or support local or state governments provide to federal immigration authorities. 
The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, classifies a sanctuary jurisdiction as “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.”
Sanctuary cities are often in areas with large immigrant populations, according to the national organization Vera Institute of Justice.
According to the American Immigration Council, some so-called “sanctuary policies” can include actions like: limiting the ability of local or state police to “arrest or detain people for federal civil immigration violations;” prohibiting cooperation agreements like 287(g), which allow ICE to deputize local officers; preventing local staff from asking about immigration status or restricting what information can be shared with federal agencies.
What Connecticut towns were on the list?
The towns of East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford and Hamden were included in DHS’s list. The state of Connecticut itself was also named a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The Department of Homeland Security did not provide an explanation as to why these towns in Connecticut were specifically cited or what the criteria were for being added to the list. It also did not provide an explanation as to why the list was taken down.
Of the municipalities on the list, only Hartford and Windham have enacted resolutions calling themselves sanctuary cities, while New Haven and Hamden have designated themselves as “Welcoming Cities” instead. 
In a statement, the Town of East Haven said that they were inaccurately named on the list. “Let us be clear: the Town of East Haven was never informed of this designation by any federal agency, nor do we agree with it,” the statement said.
“The classification issued by the Department of Homeland Security was not only absurd — it is baseless,” East Haven Mayor Joseph A. Carfora said. “Before the page was removed, my administration followed up with DHS to demand clarification and to understand how such an unfounded statement was made without any consultation or communication with our office. We will not allow East Haven to be mischaracterized without accountability.”
But New Haven and Windham officials also said they never received notification of their inclusion on the list. “Windham has a large Latino population and it’s well known the present [federal] administration targets poor communities as we have limited resources,” Mayor Thomas DeVivo said. 
New London Mayor Michael Passero said he does not know the definition of a sanctuary city.
“I can only tell you that New London has never declared itself a sanctuary city,” he said.
What are the town’s policies on immigration enforcement?
Not every town calls itself a sanctuary city, but they all have policies that deal with immigration in some way.
In New Haven, Mayor Justin Elicker signed a Welcoming City executive order in 2020, affirming “the city’s commitment to ensuring residents feel safe accessing public services.” 
The directive bars city employees from inquiring about or revealing a person’s immigration status unless mandated by state or federal law. Elicker said in a press conference last month that New Haven does not obstruct justice. He said the city’s welcoming policies make the community safer by encouraging people to report crimes, seek health care, and send their children to school without fear.
“This is something we expected, and we are proud of it,” he said in a press conference, referring to New Haven’s inclusion on the sanctuary city list. “New Haven is proudly a welcoming city… Our immigrant community is part of our New Haven family.”
East Haven’s policy is that since immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government, the East Haven Police Department generally does not participate in ICE operations except “when formally requested as part of an on-going criminal investigation, or from notifying those federal officials in serious situations where a threat to public safety or national security is perceived.” 
The Hartford Code of Ordinances does officially declare Hartford a “sanctuary city.” The local laws state that all residents of Hartford, regardless of their immigration status, have equal access to city services and referrals to medical or social agencies. This policy does not restrict city employees from cooperating with federal immigration authorities when legally required.  
Hamden’s policies limit local police involvement in federal immigration enforcement. Officers can’t ask about immigration status unless it’s tied to a criminal investigation, and cannot question victims or witnesses about their status. They also may not arrest or detain individuals based only on civil detainers or administrative warrants, except as required by state law. Town resources, including police and school staff, cannot be used to assist ICE unless mandated by state statute or a federal judge’s order.
New London has shared on its town website the Family Preparedness Plan, Preparing Your Family for Immigration Enforcement. This is a statewide document that has information for families concerned about immigration enforcement, not specific to New London. 
The New London Police Department prohibits officers from asking about immigration status unless it directly relates to a criminal investigation, according to a local executive order. Officers are also not allowed to detain or question individuals only based on suspected immigration violations, but the policy states local police may assist federal authorities if requested.
Windham became a sanctuary city following a 2017 resolution that passed unanimously. The resolution reaffirmed its commitment to protecting all residents, including undocumented immigrants who contribute to the community. It also states that no town official or “personnel” shall arrest, detain or report a person based only on immigration or citizenship status except due to a valid criminal warrant, or to comply with a civil immigration detainer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP_Hartford_skyline-1024x629.jpg,,,2025-06-30 08:07:00.249335

WOLF LAKE. Ill. — Standing on the edge of a 300-foot limestone bluff in southern Illinois’ Shawnee National Forest, Machaela Sweeney could thank the perfect words she typed into ChatGPT for bringing her to the unexpected spot.

“I literally looked up lush, magical, fairytale areas,” she recalled, looking over the edge of the forest’s Inspiration Point Trail.

A 30-year-old social worker from Hopkinsville, Kentucky, Sweeney was looking for a destination to recover from burnout. The AI app recommended two destinations: North Carolina or southern Illinois.

The first recommendation didn’t surprise her. Sweeney said that many people in Kentucky go to the Great Smoky Mountains when they want to get away. But she had never heard anyone talk about the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois before.

“So this almost feels like a hidden gem,” Sweeney said. “If somebody was going to the Smokies all the time and they were tired of it, I would say, ‘Try mixing it up.’”

The forest stretches across the eastern and western parts of southern Illinois, from Inspiration Point Trail overlooking the Mississippi River Valley here in the west to the popular Garden of the Gods wilderness area in Herod to the east.

Sweeney is among the growing number of visitors discovering southern Illinois as a travel destination amid a recent effort to entice more people to visit for the summer season.

Carol Hoffman, executive director of the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau, said the primary draws to southern Illinois are the outdoor recreation activities in Shawnee National Forest, including hiking, cycling, rock climbing and ziplining, as well as another Illinois surprise linked to the unusual terrain: vineyards and five wine trails.

The bureau has appealed to riders of the Chicago Transit Authority with a recent signage campaign that invited potential travelers to “go where the bus won’t take you” and to “come see our skyscrapers.”

In addition to plastering photos of lush greenery and rocky bluffs across Chicago buses and train stops, the bureau has paid to have promotional mailers, exhibits, shows and content creator posts that promote tourism to Illinois’ southern region.

Southern tourism bureaus have been tapping into a trend of high visitor spending in Illinois in recent years, exceeding pre-pandemic numbers for the first time in 2023, according to the most recent available data from a 2024 report prepared for the Illinois Office of Tourism.

More than $80 billion in economic impact

In 2023, tourists spent over $47 billion across Illinois, creating nearly 450,000 new jobs and generating over $6.5 billion in state and local taxes, according to the 2024 Tourism Office report. The report estimated that tourism in that year generated over $80 billion in total economic impact for the state.

Travel tourism influencer Jessica Baine, 35, has worked on tourism promotions with the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau and Jackson County’s Southern Illinois Tourism bureau for more than two years.

Baine, a Carterville nurse practitioner raised in southern Illinois, said she regularly receives messages from viewers online who were surprised by the content she shared, telling her, “I had no idea that southern Illinois looked like that.”

Hoffman’s group aims to connect with people within “an easy day’s drive,” typically those within a three- to six-hour driving distance from the forest, such as those living in central and southern Illinois and in the St. Louis metro area.

The advertising campaign is just one in a series of projects seeking to boost tourism in the area in recent years. The industry has seen a more than twofold increase in funding since 2023, with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, or DCEO, giving out over $9 million in grants to boost tourism in the southern part of the state.

That money was distributed to cities and tourism bureaus across the southern half of the state for the last fiscal year, from Alton and Mattoon down to Metropolis, the officially designated home of Superman, where fans can take photos with a 15-foot statue of the comic book hero.

Past Illinois tourism campaigns have paid major returns. In the 2023 fiscal year, every dollar invested in promoting tourism generated $75 in direct visitor spending, according to the 2023 – 2024 Economic Impact of Tourism report by the DCEO Office of Tourism.





Grant funds are matched by local hotels and motels hoping to bring travelers in, according to Hoffman.

In some cases, lodging is the attraction itself. According to Lyle and Tammy Woodrum, the married innkeepers of the Davie School Inn in Anna, Illinois, a fifth of their guests come just for the experience of staying in a former schoolhouse.

Originally built in 1853 as a school, the Davie School Inn was repurposed as a bed and breakfast, but still looks in many ways like a school, with various rooms featuring desks, globes and chalkboards covered with messages from past guests.

Susan Hill traveled from her home in Memphis to stay at the Davie School Inn last month. She said she’s done it a handful of times since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she was looking for somewhere to stay where she could sit outside.

According to Hill, the novelty of staying in an old school was a draw. “It’s like, heck yeah, come on,” she said. “It's just really quaint. I feel safe there.”

The Woodrums said most of their guests have come for the area’s local attractions, primarily the Shawnee Hills Wine trail and outdoor activities in the Shawnee National Forest but also for family and college reunions.

‘Wine just likes us’

Shawnee Hills Wine Trail is the largest of the state’s five trails, comprising 12 wineries and 13 locations. It originated in the summer of 1995, when owners of the first three wineries in southern Illinois — Alto Vineyards, Pomona Winery and Owl Creek Vineyard — worked with the Southernmost Illinois Tourism Bureau and the Carbondale Convention and Tourism Bureau to start the first wine trail in Illinois.

Maggie Pugh, assistant manager at Feather Hills Vineyard on Highway 51, said the campaign to attract tourists to the region has had a real effect on the winery. Recently, the company ran out of three of its bestselling — and most bottled — wines, which, to her, is an indicator of increased visitor flow.

“I think we are getting busier. I think the advertising has worked,” she said. “I also know that the Wine Trail is doing quite a lot to try and bring more people down, because part of the problem is, this area isn't taken seriously for wine — although it should be.”

Illinois is the second-flattest state on the nation’s mainland, seemingly perfect only for corn. But Pugh described the Shawnee Hills region — home to many of Illinois’ highest elevations — as a “little golden nugget” in which “wine (is) just likes us, grapes enjoy our soil.”

Since 2015, wineries on the trail have won over 30 medals in national and international wine competitions. Although the vineyards are geographically close together, scattered across an area of 40 miles, the trail boasts a wide range of wines, Pugh said.

“The coolest part about southern Illinois is that even a winery that’s only 20 minutes away from this location right here, our wine is going to taste vastly different, even if we made it the exact same way,” she said. “Our grapes don’t taste the same because of the elevation, and you get those slight hints that might make or break a wine for you.”

‘Illinois’ most hippie town’

Award-winning wines and breathtaking vistas aren’t the only unexpected finds in southern Illinois.

Makanda, a short drive from the Southern Illinois University campus in Carbondale, features a boardwalk of shops by local artists. Artists sell jewelry, gemstones, sage for burning, paintings, intricate metalwork and more. The tiny village of fewer than 550 people, a short drive from SIU, proudly calls itself “Illinois’s most hippie” town.

Nina Kovar is one of those artists. In her Visions Art Gallery, dream catchers are hung along the front window, inviting shoppers to come browse clothing, jewelry and handmade ceramics.

Kovar said she sees graduates coming back for homecoming again and again, as well as others who are discovering the town for the first time after hearing about its hippie reputation.

“There’s a certain timeless element to it,” Kovar said of Makanda. “The creativity that we have, that a lot of us are artists and artisans and crafters, that it's kind of nestled in nature; it’s beautiful.”

Kovar said she has seen a significant increase in tourism to Makanda since the COVID-19 pandemic, with people not flying as much, but also wanting to get out of the house and into the outdoors.

Makanda also made it onto the map, Kovar said, because of the total solar eclipse that took place on April 8, 2024. A few shops down from Kovar, artist Dave Dardis painted a line through his shop to represent the path of totality at the time.

Dardis is better known as the Rainmaker, a name he shares with his bronze art studio. A backdoor in Dardis’ shop opens out to his secret garden, a poorly kept secret in Makanda.

The garden features lush greenery and natural elements interwoven with bronze sculptures. Sweeney, a self-described whimsical person, said her visit to Dardis’ not-so-secret garden was the best part of her southern Illinois experience.

“That’s like walking into a literal fairy tale,” Sweeney said. “He’s like a hermit slash hippie slash, I don’t know, man with wisdom,” Sweeney added of Dardis. “He almost reminds me of a sage, like, you know those giant trees that talk?”

Having grown up in the area, tourism influencer Baine is well aware of the traditional engines for local economies — whether that’s coal mining or agriculture. But she sees a path for tourism to become an even bigger factor in time.

“There’s coal mines and there’s all these very blue-collar jobs, but tourism brings even more money to our region. Tourists are spending money at restaurants, at the wineries, and they can reinvest in our communities,” Baine said.

“When you live and breathe southern Illinois, and your kid goes to school here,” she said, “you want these businesses to thrive.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat’s free weekly newsletter to keep up with how education is changing across the U.S.
As schools prepare for the next academic year, a Supreme Court decision allowing religious parents to opt out of LGBTQ+ inclusive instruction will likely push educators to rethink how they approach inclusive content. 
Some teachers may shy away from teaching about topics religious families may object to, while others could look for ways to maintain inclusivity in the classroom while complying with opt-out requests. 
The Supreme Court, in its 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor, sided with religious parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who sought the right to opt their children out of LGBTQ+ inclusive instruction. The court said the Montgomery County school district’s policy, which prevented opt-out for LGBTQ+ inclusive storybooks, interfered with a parent’s right to “direct the religious upbringing of their children.” A federal appeals court will continue to review the case. 
Advocates for inclusive curriculum fear Friday’s decision lays the foundation for parents nationwide to opt their children out of material that they say conflicts with their religious beliefs — and could change how teachers approach teaching about inclusive content for all students. 
Some educators are already beginning to think about how they will adapt their curriculums in the face of the ruling and the federal push to remove diversity, equity, inclusion, and the discussion of gender identity from schools. 
In a dissent joined by the two other liberal justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that allowing students to opt out of any lesson plan or story time that might challenge their family’s religious beliefs will “impose impossible administrative burdens on schools.”
“The result will be chaos for this Nation’s public schools,” Sotomayor wrote. 
Some believe giving parents the right to opt their children out of lessons will not drastically change public education. Most schools, including those in Montgomery County, already allow kids to skip lessons related to sex education or human sexuality. A recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that nearly half of K-12 teachers support parents’ rights to opt their children out of learning about sexual orientation and gender identity at school — suggesting that many would be willing to accommodate such requests.
Yet, a 2024 survey by the RAND corporation found that only 3% of teachers thought that limits on discussing race or gender in the classroom had a positive impact on their students. Ten times as many teachers thought these limitations had a negative effect. 
Nearly two-thirds of teachers reported self-censoring how they talk about certain social and political issues in the classroom due to parental pushback, job security, and unclear guidelines. As a result, teachers felt they were unable to provide students the opportunity to learn from different perspectives or see their own identities represented. 
Opt-outs may change inclusive education for everyone 
If the Mahmoud v. Taylor ruling sparks an increase in opt-out requests, educators’ workloads could easily double as they are pushed to create separate activities and instructional materials for students who have opted out. 
“These students aren’t just going to sit around the hallway waiting. They have to be engaged,” said Stacie Brensilver Berman, a clinical assistant professor in the Teaching and Learning department at New York University Steinhardt and a veteran high school teacher. “That is a lot of work, and it’s a lot to ask.”
Rather than create a separate curriculum for students based on opt-out status, many teachers may choose to forgo the LGBTQ+ material altogether. 
Originally, Montgomery County Public Schools allowed parents to opt out of books explicitly centering on LGBTQ+ themes such as “Love, Violet,” a story about a girl who worries her same-sex crush won’t like the valentine she made for her, and “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” which follows a girl tentative about her uncle’s marriage to his boyfriend. However, a year after the curriculum was introduced, the district changed its policy citing in part that individual principals and teachers could not accommodate the growing number of opt-out requests. 
Tiferet Ani, a former teacher and content specialist at Montgomery County Public Schools who now sits on the board of History UnErased, a national provider of LGBTQ-inclusive history curriculum, believes students shouldn’t be deprived of the opportunity to learn about the existence of LGBTQ+ people and the fact that they have the legal right to exist and marry. 
Ani adds that kids are likely to be exposed to LGBTQ+ identities regardless of whether it’s taught in the classroom. If kids don’t have access to LGBTQ+ inclusive instruction in the classroom, Ani said, students will miss out on “the opportunity to have that dialogue with a teacher rather than on a playground.” 
In addition, public schools should prepare students for the real world, “not a sanitized version of it,” said Keri Rodrigues, president of National Parents Union. Rodrigues is afraid the absence of LGBTQ+ inclusive material in schools will deprive students of “the opportunity of being prepared to interact with people who are different from them, to learn from them, and to be able to be cooperative and successful in society.”
But not everyone agrees that inclusivity should be a goal of public schooling. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats believe public schools should teach children to embrace differences, compared with just over a third of Republicans. 
“A classroom environment that is welcoming to all students is something to be commended,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote on behalf of the majority. “But such an environment cannot be achieved through hostility toward the religious beliefs of students and their parents.” 
Group work, projects: some ways teachers can adapt lessons
Teachers can find ways to accommodate opt-out requests and embed inclusivity in their curriculum without taking on additional work, according to Berman who has worked closely with teachers to introduce potentially controversial topics into the classroom. 
She says small-group work and projects can be easy alternatives that allow teachers to cover material without infringing on opt-out requests. 
Teachers can provide students with a list of LGBTQ+ inclusive project topics, so everyone in the class can work on the same assignment with room for individualization. For younger students in kindergarten and first grade, Berman says kids can work in groups or stations so some might be working on an art activity in one part of the room while others listen to a read-aloud. 
Educators can also normalize inclusion in everyday instruction, says Jocardo Ralston, a veteran New York City teacher working with History UnErased. As an example, he points out that it’s impossible to talk about computer science without acknowledging the contributions of Alan Turing, a World War II codebreaker often credited as the “father of theoretical computer science.” Turing was prosecuted by the British Government for homosexuality, which was illegal at the time in Great Britain. 
Before parents opt their child out of LGBTQ+ material, Rodrigues encourages families who are concerned about what’s being taught in the classroom to engage in a meaningful conversation with their teacher and principal and look at the books in the curriculum themselves. But she also insists that educators and school districts need to be open and transparent about what is being taught in classrooms so that parents can understand the goals of their instruction.

A Hartford woman never saw her car again after it was towed while she sat in housing court fighting an eviction.
A home care worker had her car towed while she hurried to assist a patient down the stairs. 
A young man lost his car and slipped into financial instability after he mistakenly put his apartment’s parking sticker in the wrong spot.
Late last month, Connecticut lawmakers, following a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica, passed sweeping reforms to the state’s towing laws that will address many of the issues drivers have complained about. The stories highlighted how towing companies can begin the process to sell people’s cars after 15 days, one of the shortest windows in the country.
Reporters heard from dozens of drivers across Connecticut who had to pay exorbitant fees or had their vehicles sold when they couldn’t afford the charges. Many told reporters about the severe consequences they experienced after their cars were towed or sold, including the loss of jobs, personal mementos and housing.
While some people’s cars might not have been towed under the new law, which takes effect Oct. 1, it doesn’t solve all the problems that vehicle owners raised.
Here are some of their stories, as well as whether the changes in the new law would have helped them.
Towing Home Health Aides
Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.
Home care worker Maria Jiménez circled the Hartford apartment complex for low-income seniors, looking for a place to park. Jiménez drives patients to and from errands like doctor’s appointments and grocery shopping. Her patient that day last November used a cane, and Jiménez planned to park close so that her patient wouldn’t have to walk too far.
Unsuccessful, Jiménez stopped in front of the building’s entrance. 
“I turned on the hazard lights and left the car on, just long enough to let her know I had arrived, since I didn’t have her phone number,” she said. Jiménez said she told a few bystanders she would be right back and asked them to keep an eye on her car. 
She said she went inside only briefly, and when she returned, the car was gone. Bystanders told Jiménez the car had been towed and that they’d pleaded with the truck’s driver, to no avail.
Tracy Wodatch, president and CEO at Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home, said many of her members complain about getting ticketed or towed when they’re doing their jobs helping people.
When it happens frequently enough at a particular complex, she said, an agency might speak with the landlord to ask for a designated spot. But there isn’t a statewide mandate.
New Jersey passed a law in 2018 allowing home health care workers, visiting nurses and others to apply for a placard similar to an accessible parking tag to place in their cars.
“Maybe we can talk to the legislators off session to see if there’s anything we can do,” Wodatch said.
The company that towed Jiménez, MyHoopty.com, was in Watertown, and Jiménez was stranded over 30 miles away in Hartford. “How will I get there if I don’t have a car?” she recalled thinking.
MyHoopty owner Michael Festa said the vehicle was parked in the fire lane without its hazard lights on for 17 minutes before it was towed and that the apartment complex had hired MyHoopty to prevent such parking violations.  
“This is a critical safety issue, particularly at an elderly housing complex where the emergency access can be a matter of life and death,” Festa said. (MyHoopty has appeared in other stories in our series.)
The apartment complex owners didn’t respond to calls and emails for comment. 
Jiménez said she makes about $290 a week. By the time she got to MyHoopty, the company told her the bill was more than $400.
Her husband footed the bill. But it wasn’t easy: “The only reason I could afford it is because I work mornings, I work nights,” he said.
Short Meters and Unpaid Tickets
Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.
Marie Franklin paid the parking meter and dashed into Hartford housing court for a December 2023 hearing that would determine if she would get evicted from her apartment. She worried about the parking. People can wait for hours for the judge to call their cases, but the Hartford Parking Authority limits nearby meters to two hours.
So people facing eviction sometimes run the risk of getting a parking violation, getting their cars towed or missing their names being called for hearings, which can cause them to lose their housing in a default judgement for not showing up to court.
Joshua Michtom, a Hartford City Council member and an attorney who has represented children and parents in juvenile court, said although there’s a nearby parking garage, it’s more expensive and it fills up.
“You have to be there, but then you don’t know how long you’re going to have to wait,” Michtom said. “And the courts are not particularly forgiving if you’re not there the moment your case gets called.”
When Franklin’s name was finally called, a judge rejected her plea to stave off eviction. Dejected and stressed about losing her home, she walked out of court only to discover her 2015 Volvo was gone. Franklin had more than a dozen unpaid parking tickets, some of which were nearly 20 years old. She’d forgotten about some, and others were for vehicles she no longer owned. About half of the tickets were for exceeding the meter limit or parking over the line near the courthouse.
“I had paid for the parking meter and everything,” Franklin said. “They drive around, and they look for people’s cars.”

Jill Turlo, CEO of the Hartford Parking Authority, said the agency’s officers use license plate scanners to find people with outstanding tickets. Turlo said “high-traffic metered areas,” like the street the courthouse is on, are “regularly patrolled by parking enforcement.” Turlo said that the parking authority has not received any requests to extend the time for metered parking near the courthouses.
While towing cars for unpaid parking tickets is a common practice for cities, Minnesota passed a law last year barring such tows, seeing them as an unfair burden on low-income families. Several cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, have also stopped such tows after a California appeals court ruled that towing cars for unpaid parking tickets violated people’s rights against warrantless seizures, said Rebecca Miller, an attorney with the Western Center on Law & Poverty.
Hartford has one of the strictest policies in Connecticut. A city ordinance allows tows after two or more unpaid tickets that date back to September 2012. Other cities including Danbury and New Britain don’t tow for unpaid tickets. Norwalk and Waterbury will tow if there are four unpaid tickets; Stamford tows for three unpaid tickets or more than $250 owed, officials in those cities said. The limit in Bridgeport is $100, and New Haven’s is $200.
“We do have an ordinance where we can boot a car for unpaid tickets, but we haven’t used it in years,” said Deborah Pacific, director of the Danbury Parking Authority.
When Franklin went to eviction court, she had been trying to hold onto the place she and her daughter lived while she looked for a new job. Between unpaid fines, late fees, and towing and storage charges, it would have cost almost $3,000 to get her car back, she said.
“I would have chose to pay whatever I owed to my housing. So my car, there was nothing I could do,” Franklin said.
The vehicle was towed by Metro Auto Body & Towing, which did not return calls and emails for comment. It was later sold by the lender.
After losing her car and housing, Franklin moved to Florida to stay with her son.
Parking Sticker in the Wrong Place
Fixed: Apartment residents now have 72 hours if caught without a parking permit or with an expired one.
It’s often little discrepancies that lead to big consequences. When Tishawn Tillman moved into his Hartford apartment in September, he got a parking sticker that allowed him to park in the building’s private lot. He said he wasn’t sure where to put it, so he stuck it on the driver’s side window. 
But less than a month later, his car was towed by Cross Country Automotive in Hartford.
“There is absolutely no legal documentation in my lease that says that this has to be strictly on the windshield,” Tillman said.
Minor rule violations such as parking crooked or not backing into a space have caused people’s cars to be towed and then sold when they couldn’t afford the fees. Stories like Tillman’s drove legislators to act. Under the new law, the towing company would have had to warn Tillman, giving him 72 hours to get a new sticker and place it in the right spot. The law also says towers have to get permission from the apartment complex to tow a vehicle unless it’s blocking traffic or parked in a fire lane.
Tillman said he assumed his car had been stolen. But the police told him it had been towed.
Tillman contacted Cross Country: “I asked them, ‘Did you see my sticker?’ And they said, ‘We didn’t see the sticker.’” He said he called the apartment manager, but he wouldn’t help.
“When I realized that neither of the parties were going to budge on the matter, I told them that I wasn’t going to pay the fine, even if I had the money, which I didn’t at the time,” Tillman said.
Tillman said his bill was “$200 but growing every day.”
He filed a complaint with the attorney general’s office, which said it unsuccessfully tried to resolve the issue through its voluntary mediation program and recommended he complain to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Sal Sena, Cross Country’s owner, submitted a letter to the attorney general saying there are signs all over the parking lot explaining the rules. The apartment manager, Jack Matos, wrote to the attorney general that he talked with Sena about giving TIllman a discount on the towing fees.
“I reiterated Tishawn needs to make sure that it’s placed on the windshield,” Matos wrote.
Frustrated, Tillman eventually gave up trying to get his car back.
“I went from being a self-made young man with his own apartment and car to having to burn a hole in my pocket just to get to and from work on ride-share services like Uber and Lyft,” he said.
Unable to Reclaim Car Despite Having the Title
Fixed: The law allows vehicle owners to reclaim their cars with other documents besides DMV registration.
Shaleah Carr needed two more weeks until her DMV appointment in April to register the Chevrolet Malibu she had just bought from her mom. It was the earliest appointment she could get.
Her boyfriend had taken the car to his brother’s house to work on it when they decided to take it for a test drive. But the car broke down on U.S. Route 5 in South Windsor, and police called for a tow. 
Her boyfriend told the tow truck driver that the car was registered to Carr’s mother and that Carr had the title and proof of insurance. But the towing company, Tolland Automotive, wouldn’t release the vehicle to Carr because she wasn’t the registered owner, said the company’s owner, George Fellows. The vehicle was towed on a Friday afternoon, and by the time Carr was able to get to the lot on Monday morning, she owed more than $300.
“I told them I’m on one income and I can’t afford it,” Carr said. “I just paid my rent for that month, and I even asked, ‘Do you guys do payments?’” 
Since then, her Malibu has been sitting in the company’s lot.

Carr’s dilemma has happened to people whose cars have been towed across Connecticut — they’ve been unable to quickly register their cars and then blocked from reclaiming them because they’re not registered in their names yet. By the time they can register their cars, so much time has passed that the tow bill is too expensive or the company has sold their car.
The new law gives consumers time to register their car before it can be towed and requires towers to release vehicles if presented with the title or a bill of sale as proof of ownership. The law also requires towers to accept other forms of payment besides cash and demands towers have business hours on weekends so fees don’t accrue while they’re closed.
Fellows said police called them to the scene. “Then we found out that this guy didn’t own the car at all,” Fellows said. Without the owner there, “it had to come back to our shop.”
Carr called her mother. “I was like, ‘You’re going to have to come up here,’ but even if she does, she can’t really do much,” Carr said. “She didn’t have the money to get it back either.”
Carr said the last time she called Tolland Automotive, the bill was $800. Given that she paid her mother only $500 for the car, she said, it almost wasn’t worth trying to get it back anymore.
Fellows said Carr’s mother did come into the office earlier this month with proof of registration, and he is willing to release the vehicle if she pays what is owed.
“It’s all on them,” he said. “I mean they knew what the issue was back then. Why haven’t they come back?”

Registry shows only 22% of owners have a primary mailing address in town.

This story by Aaron Calvin and Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 26.
Data from Stowe’s new short-term rental registry, which went live at the beginning of May, shows that most of those properties’ owners don’t live in town full-time.
Of the 891 registrants who provided the town of Stowe with information about their rental properties as of late May, just 196, or 22 percent, listed their “owner mailing address” in Stowe.
Another 86 registrants have mailing addresses listed in Vermont. Nearly as many properties — 260 — are registered to Massachusetts mailing addresses.
According to assistant town manager Will Fricke, about 90 short-term rental owners have failed to respond to mailed requests that they participate in the registry.
The registry requirement was codified last year, after a 3-2 majority of the Stowe Selectboard voted to pass an ordinance that would establish a short-term rental regulation. That ordinance requires property owners to share information about themselves and their property managers with the town and adhere to certain regulations for public safety purposes.
The ordinance was opposed tooth and nail by a class of rental owners and property managers who were able to petition for a public referendum on the law. A town meeting held in May 2024 saw Stowe residents overwhelmingly support — in a 435-240 vote — the establishment of a town registry.
The data collected in the registry reveals what many advocates for the proposal suspected: there are many short-term rentals in Stowe and most of them are owned by non-residents. What implications this has for Stowe’s housing access needs, an ongoing subject of analysis and public discussion from the formation of the new town plan to the town’s nascent housing task force, remains to be determined.
Selectboard reactions
Stowe selectboard members said it’s too early to draw conclusions about the registry, but next month’s highly-anticipated report from the housing task force — after a year-long charge to study housing in Stowe — could spark selectboard discussions about short-term rentals and other housing topics.
According to emails between town manager Charles Safford and Jeff Sauser of CommunityScale, a housing consultant who outlined a timeline for Stowe’s registry and other housing goals, the selectboard wants to wait until next year to discuss the results of the registry, after gathering a year’s worth of data.
Short-term rental property owners in Stowe aren’t required to register with the town until their property becomes active, so a year’s worth of data would give the town a full picture of how many properties there are in Stowe. But with a good chunk of properties already registered, selectboard chair Paco Aumand said the board might want to discuss the registry sooner than a year.
“Creating the registry has accomplished what it was set out to do, and that is provide valuable data around how many short-term rentals we really have in Stowe,” Aumand, who initially voted against the registry, said. “Now it’s time to take a hard look at what that means in terms of action.”
For Aumand, the ultimate goal is to boost Stowe’s full-time population, which aligns with the town plan and stated public opinion. But targeting short-term rentals is just one tool in the toolbox, according to McKee Macdonald, chair of the housing task force. He pointed to other tools like deed restrictions, new housing development, or establishing a housing reserve fund.
Sauser agreed.
“Short-term rentals have been a popular topic in Stowe for years, but there are many more housing ideas that frankly haven’t been baked through,” he said. “We don’t want the conversation to start and end with short-term rentals.”
Rep. Jed Lipsky, I-Stowe, is in favor of short-term rentals for homesteaders, but not for out-of-staters or “private equity types looking to build a portfolio,” and he agreed with Sauser.
Lipsky advised against “scapegoating” short-term rentals for Stowe’s housing crisis. He admits they play a role, but they’re also an important revenue source for some working-class families in Stowe.
“We could take every short-term rental off the market tomorrow, but then who in Vermont could afford to buy those properties?” Lipsky said. “The solution must be multifaceted.”
Next month’s housing task force report will offer a slate of options for the selectboard — including how the board might deal with short-term rentals in Stowe — rather than specific recommendations, McKee said. From there, it’s up to the selectboard to decide on a path.
Selectboard member Ethan Carlson said that while the registry validates some of the assumptions around short-term rentals and their impact on Stowe’s housing market, the board still needs to take its time rolling out potential policy changes.
Carlson, echoing some of Lipsky’s comments, is sensitive to property rights of short-term rental owner and the 196 properties that are registered with Stowe addresses, some of which might be operated by longtime Stowe residents looking to bump up their income.
“I’d like to see the process play out,” Carlson said, referencing the task force’s upcoming report, “I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that short-term rentals would be the first action or the most logical until we kind of look at the situation holistically.”
Few big owners
Of the 891 property owners currently registered as part of the Stowe registry, 64 of them own two or more of those properties, but few own more than five.
Chuck and Jann Perkins — former “ski bums,” original owners of the Alpine Shop in South Burlington and inductees to the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame, to which they made a million-dollar donation in 2023 — are technically Stowe’s largest short-term rental owners by volume.
The Perkinses, whose primary residence is in Burlington, have registered 10 short-term rentals with the town of Stowe. All of them are condominiums located in a single building at The Lodge at Spruce Peak, the mountainside complex that features a mix of seasonal lodging, traditional hospitality and other amenities.
The couple began acquiring condos at Spruce Peak as it was being built at the turn of the century, and each time they sold a property elsewhere in town and didn’t know what to acquire next, they would pick up another and, over time, they have accumulated, Jann Perkins said.

They own 19 different properties in town, according to the Stowe grand list. She said they primarily rent those residences out on a long-term basis, and the tenants have lived in them for years. She added they may be primarily Burlington residents, but they spend most weekends in Stowe, where they are devoted members of the Stowe Community Church.
Sam Gaines, Spruce Peak Realty president, declined to say how many properties are managed as short-term rentals by the company, but a property manager with Stowe Mountain Rentals told Fricke in an email related to the short-term rental registry that the company manages more than 45 properties at The Lodge at Spruce Peak.
Gaines argued that the Spruce Peak condos, like the ones the Perkinses own, shouldn’t be considered housing units in the traditional sense, but are essentially hotel rooms. With hoteliers in Stowe managing rooms or condominiums on sites like Airbnb and VRBO, the line is increasingly a blurred one.
“Practically, we do not believe they are ‘short-term rental’ units. However, the town adopted a very unusual definition of (short-term rentals) to include hotel rooms that are owned through a condominium governance structure,” Gaines said. “We believe this is bad policy and inconsistent with most similar municipal regulations around the country.”
Another one of Stowe’s larger short-term rental owners, Ryan Rabidou, who owns five, also uses them as part of his hospitality business, Om Home Residences.
Colin Moffatt, a Stowe resident and coach at Mt. Mansfield Academy, is also among the town’s largest short-term rental owners, with six residential units in two different buildings in the heart of Stowe village.
Jose Saavedra, one of Stowe’s largest short-term rental owners and who is primarily based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, operates five short-term rentals across three separate properties. Saavedra owns nine properties through his limited-liability company in Stowe, a downsizing from the 17 residential units he owned in 2022.
Saavedra became an illustrative example of the ways in which the short-term rental market could affect housing access in the resort town after a 93-year-old was forced to leave his residence after Saavedra decided to convert the rental from long to short-term.

The degree of administrative burden on primary care is uniquely American.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kenyon Bolton: The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ will make Vermont’s primary care shortage even worse.","This commentary is by Kenyon Bolton. He is an internal medicine physician who lives in East Montpelier.


It is already difficult to find a new primary care clinician in Vermont. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” making its way through the U.S. Congress will likely make it harder thanks to its proposed Medicaid work requirements and more frequent eligibility recertifications. 
I am an internal medicine physician who works in hospital medicine. I love primary care and volunteer in an outpatient clinic, but chose employment in the hospital setting in part due to the administrative burdens increasingly placed on primary care. 
Primary care clinicians already have the unenviable task of gatekeeping many social services. When not in the exam room, they are completing paperwork for their patients’ disability determination for social security, special education services, substance use disorder support, home health services, housing and food assistance and family medical leave, in addition to onerous tasks related to documentation and insurance.
A well-staffed office works hard to help manage this load, but the pile of paperwork ends up on your doctor’s desk next to critical lab results, radiology findings, prior authorizations and medical charting.
The degree of administrative burden on primary care is uniquely American.
Compared to countries with more robust social safety nets and universal healthcare, U.S. physicians spend more time on administrative tasks, including screening for and managing social issues. Based on a recent survey compiled by the Vermont Medical Society, we know that Vermont clinicians report burnout just from prior authorizations alone. Vermont physician leaders have recently sounded the alarm regarding these cumulative pressures on primary care. 
With its enactment of Medicaid work requirements, the bill will double down on bureaucratic burdens for primary care, not to mention the Americans who depend on Medicaid. As written, the House bill would exempt “medically frail” people from work requirements, which will likely require clinician approval.
Additionally, the bill requires more frequent Medicaid eligibility recertifications, up from annually to every six months. This is a known contributor to “enrollment churn,” where enrollees lose and regain coverage. Churn increases administrative costs to states, ups the number of ED visits and hospitalizations, and swells burdens on both practices and patients.
Not only will the One Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts likely lead to increased mortality, put rural hospitals at risk of closing, and cause confusion for patients, it will probably increase the administrative burden on your primary care office. I’m not the only doctor who has steered away from primary care because of its unwieldy administrative demands as things stand, and we should all expect Vermont’s primary care shortage to worsen with this bill. 
In recent VTDigger commentaries, Alex Messinger urged Vermonters to connect with their family and friends in red states to oppose the bill’s cuts to clean energy incentives, and Dr. Julie Ehrlich at UVM has highlighted the bill’s impact on pediatric care.Additionally, we can urge Gov. Phil Scott to join our federal delegation in vocally opposing the One Big Beautiful Bill for the sake of our state’s primary care practices. I was glad to see that he did not join his Republican colleagues in supporting the bill. Let’s take the next step and call on him to join the bipartisan opposition to Medicaid cuts.

On Tuesday, the gasoline tax will rise by six cents a gallon, the first increase in nine years for the primary revenue source sustaining Washington’s transportation system.
The hike is the most prominent piece of a six-year, $3.2 billion package passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this year. 
Lawmakers turned to the tax to contend with a projected $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year transportation budget. Officials said this was caused by an inflation-fueled surge in construction costs and flattening gas tax receipts as more drivers opt for electric vehicles and as cars have become more fuel efficient.
“This will keep projects on track and ensure the promises we’ve made can be kept,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “As you drive around and see those orange cones, that’s where your money is at work.”
Tuesday’s increase will push the state’s per-gallon tax rate on gas and other vehicle fuels from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. Starting July 1, 2026, it will rise each year by 2% — about a penny annually — to account for inflation.
Also Tuesday, the state tax on diesel will climb an additional three cents, so 9 cents total, to 58.4 cents, then go up another three cents two years later. That additional six cents applied to diesel will be subject to a 2% boost each year starting July 1, 2028.
Washington will have the nation’s third highest state gas tax behind California and Pennsylvania. Connecticut is currently at 52.4 cents, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.
Washington’s state tax is on top of federal fuel taxes, which are 18.4 cents for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel.
Hiking the gas tax is expected to raise $1.4 billion over the next six years. The diesel tax is counted on to bring in $166 million over that time.
These increases are two of the larger entrees in the transportation package’s smorgasbord of new taxes and higher fees.
Under the legislation, passenger vehicle weight fees are going up a few dollars. The added sales tax for vehicles will climb from 0.3% to 0.5%. 
There’s also a new 8% tax on the portion of the selling price of vehicles above $100,000 and a 10% tax on non-commercial aircraft sales above $500,000. 
There’s a temporary increase in the rental car tax as well, from 5.9% to 11.9%, before moving down to 9.9% in 2027.
And there’s more.
The tire disposal fee will go from $1 apiece to $5 apiece. Washington State Ferries will boost its vessel replacement surcharge by 50 cents in October and start imposing a 3% fee for those who pay with credit cards next year. 
This week’s increase in gas and diesel taxes may not be immediately noticeable.
The state collects those taxes before fuel gets pumped. They are paid by the distributor — the business that buys or imports gasoline and transports it to the neighborhood gas station. Distributors will decide how they pass their costs onto the station owner, who must decide if they will pass on any added costs to customers. 
Washington created a motor vehicle fuel tax in 1921. It applied to special fuels, too, according to the state Department of Licensing.
The last gas tax boost totalled 11.9 cents and anchored the Connecting Washington transportation package passed by the Legislature in 2015. It led to increases of 7 cents per gallon in July 2015 and 4.9 cents a year later. 
Washington gas prices are higher now than a year ago. The average price of a gallon of regular gas was $4.45 on Friday compared to $4.33 in 2024, according to AAA. Nationally, the average price was $3.20 on Friday.
Critics of the state’s Climate Commitment Act, which requires refineries and other businesses to pay for their air pollution, say that law has pushed up gas prices in recent years.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gas-prices-at-pump-washington-state--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

(Getty Images)A decade after Indiana overhauled its criminal code to reduce incarceration, lawmakers approved more than a dozen new crimes and sentencing enhancements. 
The new laws, set to take effect July 1, were passed in this year’s long legislative session. Among the changes are stricter sentences for fentanyl-related offenses, harsher penalties for resisting law enforcement and criminalizing swatting – or falsely reporting an emergency.   
The Indiana Department of Correction is nearing full capacity according to a recent prison population report. As of June, state prison facilities were operating at 94.38% capacity – with one prison over 100% full. The system currently houses 25,305 inmates, with a total of 26,812 beds. 
“This is a policy decision you have to make,” Democratic Rep. Matt Pierce said. “Do you spend your resources incarcerating people for decades in a state prison, or do you spend your resources on treating the underlying causes of the crime.”
  Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington. (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The DOC is spending billions on a new prison and also has struggled to keep up with costs it owes to local county jails.
In 2014, Gov. Mike Pence signed a major criminal code reform bill to reduce prison populations and save millions in correctional costs. The bill also prioritized mental health and rehabilitation programs for lower-level offenders. Prior to the bill, a comprehensive review of the criminal code had not been done in almost 40 years. 
The bill requires the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute to annually gather data and analyze the impact of Indiana criminal code reform on local units of government, the DOC and the judicial system.
Lawmakers haven’t been shy about adding new crimes and sentences to the criminal justice landscape in Indiana. 
Pierce, who co-authored the reform bill, said newer members of the General Assembly have reverted into the old way of thinking – the idea that every year an additional sentence is added on to a crime, the crime will go down. 
“If you want to reduce crime, you can’t simply do the easy thing,” he said. “Which is to increase the penalty and then walk away and say ‘you solve the problem.’”
  Chris Naylor, executive director of the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council.
Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council Executive Director Chris Naylor said it’s not new laws that are creating issues for the DOC but the amount of violent offenders and attorney shortages. 
“Over the last 10 years, there’s been over a 40% increase in murders,” Naylor said. “And so it’s not much any new laws that are having this impact, it is the level of violent crimes that increasing in our state.” 
Naylor said caseloads show the state needs 384 more attorneys to cover cases. He said the salaries of deputy prosecutors are lagging way behind any other public service attorney or private sector attorney. 
Indiana has a growing statewide lawyer shortage especially in rural counties. Over half of the state’s counties are considered “legal deserts,” and have fewer than one attorney per 1,000 Hoosiers. In 2024, the Commission on Indiana’s Legal Future was created to address attorney shortages. They have until July 1 to submit a final report.
 Fentanyl penalty increased

A key factor in this year’s legislation was fentanyl. Indiana’s drug overdose crisis has worsened since the 2014 reforms and fentanyl came after code reform, Pierce said. In 2022, there were a total of 2,682 overdose deaths with 72% involving fentanyl or other synthetic opioids in Indiana, according to USAFacts. 
In response, Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, authored a public safety bill that increases penalties for fentanyl-related crimes. It passed with bipartisan support. 
“Public safety has always been one of my top priorities as a Senator,” Freeman said in a press release. “This bill was not created to put additional burdens on government agencies, but to keep violent criminals off the streets of our Hoosier communities. Soft-on-crime prosecuting and bail policies are hurting innocent people in many cities, including Indianapolis.”
Pierce disagrees with the bill. He also said he does not see a major criminal code reform happening anytime soon but one might be necessary if the legislature continue on the path of adding new penalties and enhancements.
“I think it was a mistake to do the new enhancements on fentanyl,” Pierce said. 
 Naylor called the fentanyl provision an appropriate response. He said our drug statutes work based on the different weights of the drug. 
“The old weights just were antiquated when you’re dealing with a substance as potent and as deadly as fentanyl, so that made total sense,” Naylor said. 
 Other crimes

Zach Stock, legislative counsel for the Indiana Public Defender Council, said his group generally opposes new crimes or enhancements. 
House Enrolled Act 1014 increases the penalty for resisting law enforcement, a charge Stock says appears in thousands of cases each year. The same law also restricts government entities from hosting or organizing obscene performances. 
“Every time we tinker with the code in one isolated area, we lose sight of the whole code,” Stock said. “But we still can’t blame the crisis on new crimes or enhancements.”
Swatting will now be a Level 6 felony in Indiana. This change comes from Senate Enrolled Act 198 authored by Freeman and Sen. Eric Koch. 
“The bill was necessary because existing law didn’t define the conduct to allow for effective prosecution. Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing amount of swatting around the country, and this was necessary to protect the safety of our citizens,” Koch said. 
Previously the punishment was a class A misdemeanor, a max of one year in prison. A person facing a Level 6 felony could spend up to two and a half years in prison. 
A new crime was introduced this year that lawmakers would have never envisioned ten years ago – signal jamming, a device that disrupts communications. SEA 26 makes it a Level 5 felony if someone uses a signal jammer to disrupt a critical infrastructure facility or the communications of a public safety agency. 
Another law makes it a Level 6 felony for a passenger of a vehicle to point a firearm during the commission of the driver’s criminal recklessness.

Editor’s Note: In May, Gov. Joe Lombardo signed Senate Bill 169, which prohibits third-party reservation websites from listing restaurants without their permission. The bill, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate, passed the Legislature unanimously and goes into effect later this year, on Oct. 1.
The following story, originally published by Stateline, provides insight into the issue, which is affecting restaurants in popular dining destinations across the country. 			


NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.
So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.
Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Seems almost quaint.
Take a look, if you can stomach it, at Florida’s sitting attorney general, one James Uthmeier Esq.
A federal judge has held him in contempt for violating a court order halting SB 4C — last session’s bill allowing the state to arrest anyone who might kinda sorta look “illegal.”
Brown folks rounded up by handcuff-happy cops included at least one American citizen.
Uthmeier took to X, proclaiming, “If being held in contempt is what it costs to defend the rule of law and stand firmly behind President Trump’s agenda on illegal immigration, so be it.”
Older readers will detect an echo of former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who did her damnedest to stall ballot recounts in the great Gore-Bush imbroglio of 2000, and who would grandly quote the Biblical Queen Esther, “If I perish, I perish.”
The AG appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, half of whom were appointed by Trump. They told him (in judicial language) to get lost.
 Scofflaw history
Uthmeier’s lucky U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams didn’t fine him or throw his arrogant backside in jail.
Still, it’s early days: Hope Florida, the nonprofit founded by the state’s ambitious First Lady, is under investigation by North Florida State’s Attorney Jack Campbell. Uthmeier is up to his eyeballs in this one.
State Rep. Alex Andrade (R-Pensacola) has accused Uthmeier of criminal fraud and money laundering.
Seems Hope Florida got a $10 million “donation” of taxpayer money, of which a good chunk went to a PAC controlled by Uthmeier.
You can’t use that money for political purposes; nevertheless, that’s just what Uthmeier’s PAC did, spending it on ads to defeat last year’s recreational marijuana amendment.
DeSantis hadn’t yet elevated Uthmeier, then his chief of staff, to the AG job, but still: The guy was an officer of the court, a member of the Florida Bar.
You’d think he’d get it.
Then again, Florida under DeSantis is not known for adherence to the rule of law.
Remember in 2022 when the governor tricked a bunch of Venezuelan asylum seekers onto a plane and flew them to Martha’s Vineyard? Legally dubious? Ethically ugly? Yes and yes.
De Santis is also the guy who suspended one state attorney for saying he wouldn’t pursue abortion cases and another because, he claimed, she wouldn’t enforce state law.
“State attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law,” he said. “Not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda,” adding that those outlaw prosecutors were “basically saying that they didn’t want to enforce statutes that the Legislature had done.”
Yet when James Uthmeier said he wouldn’t enforce a statute passed by the Legislature, namely, Florida’s 2018 law forbidding anyone under 21 to buy a long gun, the governor shrugged.
He said that law is unconstitutional anyway and that Uthmeier’s stance was a “good-faith position.”
What’s the difference? The two state attorneys he suspended are Democrats.
Besides, as Floridians all know, the sacred right to pack heat matters more than actual human beings like the two people killed by a white supremacist Trumper on the FSU campus in April.
Unfortunately for us, DeSantis and his enablers aren’t particularly troubled by a bit of violence, as long as it’s perpetrated by the right people.
While he initially criticized the Jan. 6 riot, calling it “unacceptable,” he soon fell in line with MAGA-speak, denying there was an “insurrection” of any kind and defending Trump’s role in what was clearly an attempted coup.
So what if a few Capitol police got roughed up? They were on the wrong side.
In Florida, we like cops to be on the right side, making sure Marxists, environmentalists, feminists, BLM radicals, LGBTQ-types, and other outside agitators get what’s coming to them.
And, according to the governor, citizens can play cop, too.
In advance of the No Kings protests on June 14, DeSantis decreed that any patriotic, God-fearing, Trump-voting motorist who felt threatened or even just mildly inconvenienced by those freaks marching in one of the 70-odd demonstrations across Florida had his permission to give ’em a little automotive nudge.
“If you drive off and you hit one of these people, that’s their fault for impinging on you,” he said. “You don’t have to sit there and just be a sitting duck and let the mob grab you out of your car and drag you through the streets.”
DeSantis clearly cut con law class the day they discussed freedom of assembly.
 Something in the water?
You begin to wonder if there’s something about Florida that encourages a complete disregard not just of decent behavior but of the rule of law.
Maybe it’s some kind of mosquito-borne illness? Maybe the toxic algae choking our waters emits a foul miasma that clouds the brain’s moral center?
Maybe it’s a fish problem, you know, rotting from the head down?
In any case, scofflaws flock to Florida like rats to a burger joint dumpster.
We’ve a long history of criminality: Al Capone hung out in Miami Beach, and Charles Ponzi sold worthless swampland to rubes dreaming of a life in “paradise.”
It’s no surprise the current occupant of the White House, a casino-bankrupting grifter with 34 felony convictions, chose Palm Beach County as his home.
For a brief period in history — way back there, from the 1960s to the 1990s — Florida was known as a good-government state, with leaders such as Reuben Askew, Bob Graham, and Lawton Chiles, who promoted education, conservation, and transparency.
Again, quaint.
In the past couple of decades, however, we’ve elected such prize porkers as a governor whose company perpetrated a huge Medicare and Medicaid fraud and an attorney general who saw nothing untoward in taking a $25,000 campaign contribution from Donald Trump then dropping an investigation into his shady “university.”
Rick Scott is now a U.S. senator; Pam Bondi is now the attorney general of the United States.
Bondi’s busy demonstrating how much she learned in Florida, doing her damnedest to destroy the separation of powers enumerated in the Constitution.
She’s suing every single federal judge in the state of Maryland for having the brass-faced gall to issue orders insisting on due process for people the Trump regime wants to deport.
Doing their job, in other words.
 Lawyers or lawless?
Meanwhile, back down here in the sunniest state with the shadiest government, DeSantis and Uthmeier are back with a brand new bad idea: “Alligator Alcatraz,” a huge ICE detention camp in the Everglades.
The state seized the land from Miami-Dade County to park a 5,000-bed facility bang in the middle of the state’s greatest environmental treasure.
Who cares if it’s legal? It sure ain’t moral.
Despite the state’s claims that the place won’t hurt the surrounding wetland ecosystem (apparently 5,000 people in housing pods won’t create any run-off and all the trucks and buses transporting people and supplies will not make a mark upon the land), it’s an assault on a vulnerable and irreplaceable place.
Remember that the next time you hear DeSantis’ bleating how he wants to “save” the Everglades.
DeSantis, Bondi, and Uthmeier may call themselves lawyers, but they are lawless.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaiceGujVUrVW4AA9pXF.jpeg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor.More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.



“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

The challenges facing our communities are daunting. The pace of technological, economic and social change is relentless. The pursuit of the resources needed to fuel progress and improve the quality of life is all-consuming.
As Indiana-based Sagamore Institute documented last year in its “Workforce 2040: Pathways to Prosperity” report, our state and our communities have arrived at a pivotal moment in history as powerful economic, demographic and technological trends converge.
Great opportunities lie ahead but also great challenges. How we tackle both at the local and state levels will largely shape the quality of life in cities and towns throughout Indiana in the years ahead.
The good news is that our mayors and other community leaders don’t have to face these challenges alone. We want to offer a way to help.
Goldsmith program
In April, Sagamore Institute announced the inaugural Goldsmith Prize for Innovation in Local Government, an initiative that will recognize and support an Indiana community that is responding to today’s challenges with fresh thinking and forward-looking solutions
The award is named after former Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, long recognized as a national leader in delivering innovative solutions to local governments in our state and beyond.
The Goldsmith Prize is about innovation in the broadest sense: rethinking outdated processes, forging creative partnerships, designing smarter policies and improving service delivery in ways that make life better for residents.
It’s about celebrating what’s working – and sharing it so others can benefit. What succeeds in Vincennes may also help Richmond, Bluffton or Brazil.
The winning community will receive not only recognition but also practical support: a graduate student with expertise in the project’s focus area will be assigned to help lead implementation in 2026. The position will be funded through the prize via a one-year stipend.
Additional technical advice and information resources will be provided, along with a platform to share success stories, foster partnerships, and encourage replication and innovation across the state.
Applications for the Goldsmith Prize are now being accepted. The deadline to apply is July 31.
In August, a panel of leaders in the business sector, nonprofit organizations and government will review applications to determine three finalists. Leaders from those communities will be invited to give a presentation on Aug. 22. From those presentations, the inaugural winning community will be selected and announced at the Aim Ideas Summit in October in French Lick.
Sparking innovation
So, what does innovation look like?
As mayor of La Porte, one of us (Blair) approved a recommendation from the city engineer to use a comprehensive asset management system that evaluated the condition of every street in the city’s 113-mile network. Each road received a PASER score (1 to 10), enabling the city to rank streets from best to worst and develop a long-term plan that prioritized critical repairs while preserving roads in good shape.
It wasn’t flashy, but it was smart. This data-driven, proactive approach helped La Porte stretch limited resources further— and it later became the model for a now-required process in the state’s Community Crossings Matching Grant program.
That’s the kind of innovation we’re talking about — not just new gadgets or apps, but better ways of doing the work that matters most – whether that’s managing infrastructure, tackling housing or workforce challenges, improving customer service or strengthening civic trust.
How is your community rethinking how it serves residents? What partnerships, tools, policies or practices are helping you do more with less – and do it better?
We want to know, not only to recognize and reward your success but also to inform and inspire leaders in other communities.
Because we know how hard it can be to lead well when the pace of change is so intense. Because we know resources are perpetually tight.
And because we know that by working together in our communities and across our state, we can find the solutions to meet the enormous challenges that lie ahead.

Without those guardrails, expansion remains a policy in name, not in practice (Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)In Missouri, we don’t just live with fewer healthcare options. We live with the knowledge that when help doesn’t come, it’s not an accident. It’s policy.
I’m a nurse. I’ve worked in rural hospitals, in short-staffed ICUs, in systems that have learned how to survive without actually protecting anyone. And what I see now is worse than neglect. It reflects a pattern of disinvestment that disproportionately harms the communities least able to withstand it.
When Missouri expanded Medicaid, it should have brought relief to communities long denied basic care. But expansion on paper doesn’t mean access in practice. Administrative backlogs, endless documentation hurdles, and network gaps continue to leave people stranded. In rural Missouri, I’ve seen patients with Medicaid cards still turned away. Expansion without infrastructure does not create equity, it creates the appearance of reform without its substance.
In 2020, Missouri voters passed Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative. Lawmakers delayed implementation for nearly a year. That delay wasn’t just bureaucratic. It was ideological. The same political opposition continues to influence how care is distributed or withheld across the state.
To be clear, challenges in administering Medicaid are real. Eligibility redeterminations involve complex systems. Rural provider recruitment is difficult. Coordination between state agencies and federal requirements often creates delays that are frustrating for both patients and administrators.
But acknowledging these logistical hurdles does not excuse their persistence. Missouri’s failure is not in encountering difficulty. It is in choosing not to fix what has been broken for years. When barriers are allowed to persist despite known solutions, the outcome is not accidental.
Meanwhile, Missouri continues to use a provider tax shell game to draw down billions in federal Medicaid dollars. Hospitals get the financial boost. But there is no requirement that those dollars improve care, staff safety, or patient outcomes. The state collects its match. The money circulates. And the hospitals that serve the poorest communities still close.
According to the Leapfrog Group and the U.S. Office of Inspector General, preventable harm events including falls, infections, and medication errors are significantly more common in hospitals with chronic staffing shortages. While safety grades vary across Missouri, the pattern is clear: when staffing ratios fall, risks to patients rise.
When Noble Health shut down the hospital in Mexico, Missouri, in 2022, patients were given no notice. Staff were told by text message. The facility that once served 11,000 ER visits a year went dark overnight. The company had collected CARES Act funds and Medicaid reimbursements before walking away, leaving behind debt, missing records, and no services.
According to state officials, 12 rural hospitals have closed in Missouri since 2014, with a total of 21 hospital closures statewide during that period. More than a dozen others are at risk. OB units are disappearing. Behavioral health beds are gone. And the people left behind are expected to accept this as a funding issue, not a policy choice.
Between June 2023 and May 2024, 400,000 Missourians, including nearly 200,000 children, lost Medicaid coverage. The majority were still eligible but were removed due to procedural errors, incomplete paperwork, or system backlogs. This phenomenon, known as ‘churn,’ is well documented and largely preventable.
Missouri’s procedural termination rate has been among the highest in the country. During several months in 2023, more than 70% of terminations occurred for paperwork reasons rather than actual ineligibility, significantly above the national average.
These administrative failures have financial consequences. When coverage is lost due to technicalities, the state avoids paying for services and saves money. In rural Missouri, where local caseworkers are often nonexistent and providers are scarce, losing Medicaid means losing access altogether.
The Missouri Department of Social Services has long struggled with timely renewals and enrollment processing. But instead of investing in systems that protect continuity of care, the state has maintained systems that obscure accountability and allow breakdowns to persist without correction.
Clinics lose reimbursements. Hospitals reduce services. Patients disengage. Not from care, but from a system that seems designed to shed them.
This is often framed as fiscal responsibility, but in effect, it is policy negligence with life-altering consequences.
In towns like Mexico, Moberly and Kennett, residents already live hours from specialty care.
When the local ER shuts down, it is not just an inconvenience. It is a death sentence that arrives slowly through missed diagnoses, delayed stroke care, untreated infections and silent mental health crises.
Stroke centers disappear when hospitals downgrade. Cardiac care vanishes when chest pain is rerouted to the next county. For rural Missourians, the question is not just when care will arrive, but whether it will arrive in time to matter. This is not a new phenomenon.
A similar wave of closures followed Medicare payment reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. What is different now is how much more consolidated and extractive the system has become. What we are seeing in 2025 is not merely underinvestment, it is a systematic withdrawal of support, often driven by financial incentives misaligned with patient care.
I have watched patients wait twelve hours in ER hallways for a bed. I know of times where the early warning signs were missed because the nurse was covering too many patients. These are not rare exceptions. They are the predictable outcomes of chronic understaffing and systems that treat care as a cost center.
Missouri hospitals are facing a sustained staffing crisis.
In 2023, about 16% of registered nurse positions were vacant across the state. Rural hospitals have been hit especially hard, with turnover and burnout worsening year after year. In some Missouri facilities, nurses have reported caring for five or more patients in units designed for closer supervision, exceeding commonly accepted ratios for step-down care.
This is not a temporary problem. It reflects a chronic shortage that puts both patients and staff at risk. Unsafe staffing has become the norm, and no award or marketing campaign can disguise the consequences of underinvestment in the workforce.
We know what stabilizes care. Local hospitals. Fair reimbursement. Staff-to-patient ratios that protect workers and outcomes. Behavioral health beds. Transportation. Language access. These are not mysteries. They are choices.
Missouri must tie Medicaid dollars to measurable outcomes such as access, staffing and infrastructure. Without those guardrails, expansion remains a policy in name, not in practice.
Until then, rural patients will keep falling through cracks. That is not fiscal prudence. It is political malpractice. And we cannot afford to wait quietly for the next hospital to close.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hospitalbed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

But this year, Hemmes said, […]","A farmer harvests corn near Slater, Iowa. on Oct. 17, 2020 (Perry Beeman/Iowa Capital Dispatch).For April Hemmes, a fourth-generation farmer on land her family has worked for almost 125 years in north-central Iowa, life is guided by a simple philosophy: “Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”
It’s a mindset that has helped her navigate extreme weather, market shocks and trade disputes.
But this year, Hemmes said, feels different: President Trump’s recent tariff hikes on nearly all major U.S. trading partners have escalated a trade war, fueling uncertainty that is hard to prepare for.
“If there’s all this uncertainty out there, how can we plan? We need a path forward,” Hemmes said. “It’s like changing a tire while we’re still driving down the road.”
U.S. farmers had to navigate a trade war during Trump’s first term, but did so after years of rising commodity prices and government aid.
During the first trade war, Hemmes, a soybean and corn farmer, was able to reduce her debt and invest in new equipment, giving her a cushion and leaving her in “pretty good shape.”
However, this second Trump trade war comes at a time when farmers are in a more vulnerable financial position.
Over the last four years, grain prices have been on a downward trend. Soybeans — a major U.S. export and a pillar of the Midwest economy — have lost 34% of their value on the international market. Net farm income, while still above pre-pandemic levels, has declined for three consecutive years.
At the same time, input prices for fertilizer, fuel and other essential supplies have surged over the past five years, squeezing farmer profit margins and putting added strain on operations.
“The big difference between the first trade war and now is our input prices. They’re a lot higher than they were,” Hemmes said.
Borrowing has also become significantly more expensive for farmers, as the average interest rates charged on loans for land purchases and farm operations have increased by over 40% since 2020.
“I’ve never seen a time where the level of policy uncertainty is as high as it is right now,” said Patrick Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri.
“You have all the normal uncertainties that farmers face just because of weather and so on. Now you’ve got this huge policy uncertainty as well. It may turn out well, or it may turn out very badly, and we just don’t know right now.”
Westhoff said the financial health of farmers facing this second trade war varies by sector, with crop producers in a challenging position, while the cattle sector is faring better thanks to higher prices.
“We’ve seen net returns to crop producers fall back to levels we hadn’t seen since before COVID,” Westhoff said. At the same time, he said, fixed costs are much higher, and land and machinery prices are up.
“At some point, something has to change. Either they have to get more income or they have to reduce some expenses.”
Fertilizer is one of a farmer’s most significant expenses and has sharply increased.
Ammonium fertilizer, used heavily for corn, increased by more than 15% over the past five years. Phosphorus and potassium, essential for soybeans, rose by over 10%, according to Farmdoc, a research initiative from the University of Illinois’ Department of Agriculture and Consumer Economics.
Diesel, vital for equipment and transport, has seen the second-largest price hike.
“Farmers spend a lot of money before we even put a seed in the ground. We have to borrow a lot of money before we even plant,” Hemmes said.
Farmers have made it through the year relatively well, Hemmes added, mainly because most purchases for the harvest were made the previous year, before the trade tensions arose.
“We’re kind of holding our breath for this fall… that’s when it will hurt the most farmers,” Hemmes said.
 Bigger bills, tighter margins and loans farmers can’t repay

By late 2024, farmers were finding it much harder to borrow money. Bankers reported farms had less cash on hand and weren’t expecting enough income in 2025.
Chad Hart, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, said farmers are in a tough spot: high costs and low crop prices force them to take on more loans, but it’s getting harder to pay them back.
Farmers are applying for more loans than they did a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which tracks agricultural lending in Iowa, Michigan and most of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.
At the same time, the index of repayment rates for non-real-estate farm loans has declined year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, suggesting that many farmers are struggling to catch up, even as they take on more debt to stay afloat.
“Loan repayment has dropped,” Hart said. “A lot of this action is due to just the general decline in crop income over the past couple of years, which started before the trade fight.”
Meanwhile, agricultural loan interest rates have soared to historic highs, well above the levels farmers faced during Trump’s first trade war, making credit more expensive just when many need it most.
Part of the pressure stems from a political clash in Washington. Trump has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, arguing that Americans need cheaper credit. He has even threatened to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
However, the central bank, designed to operate independently, has resisted political pressure.
Federal Reserve officials say they are weighing the inflationary risks of the tariffs and prefer to wait for more economic data before adjusting rates. They also worry that yielding to White House demands could damage the institution’s credibility.
Hart said the current downturn isn’t solely the result of tariffs, but rather the outcome of several compounding pressures. As the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to curb inflation, borrowing costs for farmers also rose. Combine those higher financing costs with falling commodity prices from oversupply, and now renewed tariff concerns, and “you get a recipe for a depressed market,” he said.
 A fragile truce on tariffs is likely temporary

After months of economic fallout, the U.S. and China reached a temporary truce that took effect June 11, cutting tariffs from record highs of 145% to 55% on Chinese goods and 10% on U.S. exports.
Although tensions with China have eased, tariffs on other major trading partners, announced in April, have only been paused until July 9. The truce is widely seen as fragile and temporary.
Hemmes said one of the consequences of the first trade war was that it opened the door for South American countries to enter the Chinese market, especially Brazil, which has become its leading soybean supplier.
Although the U.S. no longer sells the same volume of soybeans as before, “you cannot discard how much China buys,” even as the industry works to diversify its markets in other Asian countries, Hemmes said.
“We need trade with Mexico and Canada, too,” Hemmes added. “That’s why I think the reciprocal tariffs are going to hurt us more. We get fertilizer from Canada, ag chemicals from China, at least some of them. We get parts and products made in Mexico.”
As planting season got underway in April, many farmers were on edge about the ripple effects of U.S. trade policy. A majority of farmers said they expected current tariffs to hurt their bottom line this year, according to the Ag Economy Barometer from Purdue University and the CME Group, which surveyed 400 producers from April 14 to 21.
Farmers expressed particular concern about rising costs and limited availability of key supplies, especially fertilizer, crop chemicals and machinery parts.
However, while 44% said they anticipated a negative impact on farm income in 2025, and 53% feared continuing supply disruptions, 70% said they still believed that higher tariffs could ultimately strengthen the U.S. agricultural economy.
The same study, conducted a month later, also found that producers were more optimistic about both current conditions and future expectations.
“One of the drivers behind this month’s shift in farmer sentiment appeared to be a much more positive view of the U.S.’s long-run agricultural trade prospects,” the report said.
This shift in tone may reflect what Financial Times commentator Robert Armstrong calls TACO, short for Trump Always Chickens Out. The term describes a pattern in Trump’s trade policy: announcing sweeping tariffs that trigger economic shock, panic and stock market drops, only to reverse course later with pauses or reductions that help markets rebound.
“I think markets have become a bit skeptical about what’s actually going to happen,” Westhoff said. “So we saw in the case of the USMCA countries, Mexico and Canada, that, at least right now, tariffs don’t apply to them when it comes to agricultural products.”
He added that with those countries and the European Union — three of the most important trading partners for the U.S. farm sector — trade remains unchanged on the agricultural front.
However, Westhoff warned that the market reaction could be severe if the high tariffs move forward.
“If we get to July 9, or whatever the magic date ends up being, and we do indeed impose those very high tariffs and countries respond,” he said, “then we’re going to see a big market disruption.”

(Photo obtained by the Wisconsin Examiner)A Canadian mining company began work on an exploratory drilling project in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Taylor County earlier this month, triggering local concerns that the project could harm groundwater and the nearby north fork of the Yellow River as the company and state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) insist the permitting and regulatory processes are enough to keep the environment safe. 
Green Light Metals, which runs its U.S. operations out of Medford, owns the mineral rights to the Bend deposit in Taylor County, about 19 miles north of Medford, and the Reef deposit near Wausau. The Bend deposit, which has been explored before, contains copper, gold, silver and zinc. The deposit is estimated to contain more than 4 million tons of ore. If the drilling exploration is successful, it could lead to a larger underground mine. 
The start of work on the project is the beginning of the company’s efforts to expand its operations in the U.S. after it went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange earlier this year. 
“Wisconsin is open for business,” the company’s CEO Matt Filgate said on an investing focused podcast earlier this month. 
Company officials say their aim is to protect the environment while nodding to the possibility that a mine in the region could produce materials necessary for green infrastructure — mostly tellurium, a metal necessary in the construction of solar panels. 
“There are very detailed environmental review and environmental studies that are done on virtually every aspect of the surrounding environment,” Steven Donahue, a Green Light Metals board member, told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in April. “An important component of that is the water resources, but it’s also all the ecosystems. It’s the engineering of the project, it’s how the project is going to be closed and reclaimed, and how it’s going to be able to protect the environment, not only during construction and operations, but also after it’s closed. All those facets of a project would be evaluated by the state.”
Views of the project within the rural, largely conservative county — President Donald Trump won Taylor County with 73.5% of the vote last year — vary widely. Much of the county is covered by the national forest, which Juliana Reimann, a Madison resident who grew up in the county and remains a regular visitor, says is a “magnificent, breathtaking natural environment.” 
Conservative hunters and fishers in the area are concerned about the drilling project’s potential effect on those activities in the forest or on the Yellow River. Still, some community members are hopeful the mine can bring some economic benefits to the community and others are keeping a watchful eye on the project without making a conclusion. 
“Some of the people who are in our group are adamantly opposed to any mine, period,” Cathy Mauer, a member of the Friends of the Yellow River, says. “Some of us think that so far they’re trying to be careful without being naive about it because the goal is to make money for their investors.” 
“I’ve found sometimes the people from Green Light are being, I don’t think they’re lying, I think they believe it, but I don’t think they’re being realistic about the potential problems,” she adds. “I think they’re being straightforward, they’re either optimistic or aren’t being completely realistic about the potential problems. And maybe we’re imagining the worst case scenario, which we need to. It’s the worst case scenarios that cause the problems. That’s what we have to plan for.”
Some environmental activists remain much more concerned about the possible effect of the drilling operation on the local water. 
“I really have such a love for that forest, and that drilling site is right smack dab in the middle of it,” Reimann says. “The project will impact groundwater, as I see it, heavily. And of course, groundwater is critical as drinking water.”
She adds that the health of the forest is important for the community’s ability to “thrive.” 
Wisconsin was under a mining moratorium from 1997 until 2017, which required companies that wanted to mine sulfide ores such as copper and gold to prove that other mines operated and were closed for 10 years without causing pollution. While business groups lauded the law’s repeal as opening up the state to billions of dollars in investment, drilling operations in the state have yet to result in a full mine being opened. 
With the repeal gone, the DNR’s permitting process for drilling operations requires companies to obtain a license and file a notice of intent to drill, which the state can deny, approve or approve with conditions. The company must then obtain a number of permits relating to stormwater discharge, dewatering operations, endangered species and wetland preservation. Because the site is within the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service also has its own permitting process. 
The DNR’s approval of Green Light Metals’ notice of intent included nearly two dozen conditions but despite that, environmental activists remain concerned about a number of aspects of the project. 
When the company drills into the bedrock where the minerals are, the drill must go through the layers, known as the glacial overburden, above it, which requires a steel casing to keep chemicals out of the groundwater. The company obtains cuttings from the bedrock that can be tested for the metals it is looking for. After drilling is complete, the hole is filled from the bottom up with cement, which pushes up the lubricants and water used in the drilling process and flushes out the hole. 
State regulations require that the pipe used to pump in that cement be submerged the entire time so as to prevent air pockets forming. This is often done using what’s known as a tremie pipe, but Green Light Metals is instead pouring cement through the drill rods themselves, which come in 10 foot sections and therefore require that crews stop as each piece is removed — a method that activists are concerned makes the process more likely to cause pollution but DNR metallic mining coordinator Molly Gardner says is common practice. 
The materials flushed out of the drill hole as the cement rises are then put into a lined waste pit dug by the company, encased with more cement and finally covered with the topsoil. 
Activists are concerned the company will not be thorough enough to protect the environment throughout this process.
“It’s like any industrial activity, there is room for error, and if not fixed, you could have a problem,” Dave Blouin, the political chair for the Wisconsin Sierra Club, says. 
Additionally, there has been a dispute about the type of land the company is operating on. Green Light Metals says there is some wetland in the area, but not where it is drilling, while activists say much of the area is wetland, directly connecting the groundwater with the Yellow River. A recent study by the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey found that “the North Fork Yellow River and surrounding surface waters are connected to the shallow glacial aquifer.”
“The North Fork Yellow River is a river within the Chippewa Basin. Over 3,000 stream and river miles flow within the Chippewa River basin and with 156,200 acres of freshwater lakes, 22,711 acres of flowages and more than 150 acres of freshwater springs. The river basin watershed provides significant habitat, recreation, navigation and is a significant drinking water resource for northwest Wisconsin people,” Wisconsin Trout Unlimited said in a resolution opposing the Bend project. “Mining of metallic sulfide ores and minerals has a consistent proven record of surface and ground water contamination and pollution. This potential source of pollution threatens the groundwater of Taylor County and the surface waters of the Chippewa Basin watershed.”
When the company began digging the waste pit for its first drill hole last week, the crew hit water just four feet below ground, which opponents of the project say was the groundwater and proof the area is mostly wetland. 
State regulations require that waste pits for drilling “shall not be at or below the groundwater table at the time of the drilling activity and shall be constructed such that the base will remain above the normal local groundwater elevation.”
Reimann and other opponents believe the company moving forward puts the entire watershed at risk. 
“This drilling is taking place very close to the north fork of the Yellow River,” Reimann says. “It’s taking place in vast wetlands, the hydrology is such that any kind of contamination there will affect not only the Yellow River. The Yellow River flows to the Chequamegon Waters Flowage. People up there refer to it as Miller dam, that’s a very popular camping and fishing site, as well as close to the rice beds of the Ojibwe and ultimately those waters will migrate westward to the Chippewa River, to Lake Wissota and I guess ultimately to the Black River [and] to the Mississippi. You know that water doesn’t stay in one place, so it has a huge negative impact if those waters are contaminated.” 
But Gardner says those claims aren’t accurate and is confident in the department’s regulatory and inspection processes. She says the survey conducted by the company confirmed they weren’t drilling in wetlands and the water the crews found when digging the pit is just rainwater. She says the groundwater is actually 20 feet below the surface. 
The company’s wetland study was partially done as a “desk review” using maps, state data and satellite imagery. A field study by the company was conducted later, but “soils were not investigated,” and “WDNR Wetland Soils & Indicators (WSI) are prevalent across nearly the entire site,” a company memo states. 
“We’re looking at the access, we’re looking at the drilling operation, the sumps, the security, the safety, and everything that’s going on,” Gardner says. “We’re regulating, we’re inspecting that they follow their exploration plan.” 
She says that throughout the drilling process, which includes eight holes as part of the first phase and an additional 15 holes in the second phase, the DNR will have stormwater inspectors, exploration inspectors and Gardner herself on site at regular intervals and for occasional unannounced inspections. 
“It’s not common for the DNR to be able to go on site continuously with any type of construction projects,” Gardner says. “So mining and mining-related projects are allowed to have extra inspections to really ensure that things are going according to plan, because it is an important topic and it’s an important project, so we have more resources to do additional inspections for mining in relation to other types of construction projects.” 
Donahue, the company board member, says the company has been working with local officials and community members to keep them aware of what’s happening on the site and that the project will follow all “applicable regulations.” 
“The Green Light exploration team has been working diligently with the Wisconsin DNR and the U.S. Forest Service to secure all necessary permits and approvals for the exploration program,” he says. Green Light will work diligently to properly abandon the boreholes with the proper amount of cement in accordance with applicable regulations and permits.  In addition, the drill cuttings will be properly disposed by mixing the cuttings with cement in accordance with applicable regulations and permit requirements.”

(Getty Images)Fourth of July celebrations this week will come at a slightly higher cost than last year’s cookouts, according to the Indiana Farm Bureau. 
Feeding a group of ten will cost $71.49, or $7.15 per person — which is 5% more than what Hoosiers paid in 2024. Additionally, cookouts in Indiana will cost an estimated 6 cents more than the U.S. average, which sits at $7.09 per person. 
“Inflation is slowing slightly, prices are leveling out and supply chain issues that have been prevalent for the last few years are slowly getting worked out, so we are seeing just a slight increase in prices compared to the last few years here in Indiana,” said INFB Chief Economist Dr. Todd Davis in a release.
That $71.49 includes ground beef, cheese, hamburger buns, pork chops, chicken breasts, pork and beans, potato salad, strawberries, chips, ice cream, cookies and lemonade. 
Ice cream and strawberries saw the biggest increase between 2024 and 2025, growing by 31% and 19%, respectively — similar to the national cost increase. Hamburger buns and lemonade cost the average Hoosier roughly 8% less than their national peers.

Two main meat dishes are also slightly cheaper for Hoosiers this year: ground beef and pork chops. Ground beef fell from $13.88 for two pounds down to $13.81 while three pounds of pork chops will cost Hoosiers $14.57 this year — compared to $15.76 last year. 
“When you’re shopping, look for the bargains on the protein side,” said Davis. “According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there’s more pork in cold storage so the prices you’re seeing at the supermarket are generally going to be a bit lower. Ground beef, on the other hand, our shoppers found the price to be just about the same as last year, which is encouraging because cattle herd numbers remain low across the country.”
The federal agency estimates that 16 cents of every dollar spent on food goes back to farmers, with the rest paying for processing, packaging, distribution and food service preparation. 
“Farmers are price takers, not price makers – just like consumers,” said Janis Highley, an INFB vice president. “Margins are still tight for farmers due to high supply costs because the amount farmers are being paid isn’t covering that increase in expenses.
But Indiana farmers are committed to streamlining their operations to decrease costs of production as best they can, all while providing safe, affordable food not just for Hoosiers, but for families all over the world.”
Volunteer shoppers researched prices for their cookouts in early June throughout the state, collecting prices on the selected food items from their local grocery stores. They were directed to look for the best possible price without using a promotional coupon or purchase deal.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)Covering Oklahoma’s Legislature for over a decade, it’s difficult not to feel cynical about the end of session and all the work left undone because they focused on inconsequential or unnecessary priorities.
So back in February before this year’s legislative session, I suggested several common-sense ideas that our lawmakers could adopt. These would actually make our state a better place with increased accountability for taxpayer spending, banning school personnel from beating disabled children and preventing adults from preying on children.
As that final gavel fell on May 30, signaling the end of the first session of the 60th Legislature, I decided to assess how many of those goals they had actually accomplished. Since lawmakers are obsessed with school performance, I decided to grade them on how well they did addressing those ideas.
Raising the age of consent:  A+  At long last, lawmakers decided to raise the age of sexual consent from 16 to 18, making Oklahoma one of about a dozen states that has adopted policies aimed at protecting children from predators. Oddly enough though, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt didn’t endorse the law by penning his name to the measure. Instead, it automatically  became law because he took no action. The measure seems to adequately protect teenagers who are having sexual relations with each other while protecting them for 50-year-old creeps trying taking advantage of them.
Banning corporal punishment in school on disabled children: A+  The measure prohibiting schools from administering physical discipline on children with federally protected disabilities limped its way across the finish line following yet another incredibly embarrassing public discussion that attempted to use the Bible to justify the practice. Yet when it arrived on Stitt’s desk, he also inexplicably refused to sign this one, allowing it instead to take effect without his signature. The practice has technically been banned by the state Department of Education since 2020, but lawmakers indicated that some districts are still spanking, choking and beating disabled children. Supporters argued that the ban needed to be codified into law.
Private school voucher-like tax credits: F  It was an embarrassing session for Republicans’ controversial private school tax credit program as Oklahomans got their first peek at who is benefiting. Lawmakers pitched the program as helping poorer students who need to escape struggling districts. But in what amounted to a surprise to nobody — except apparently naive Republican legislators — we learned that 92% of participants already had children in private schools and those from families making over $250,000 a year made up 1 in 4 participants. Thankfully Republicans wised up a bit and rebuffed calls from Stitt to eliminate the program’s $250 million spending cap all together. However, they still raised spending on the program by $50 million to top out the program’s spending at $250 million. Republicans also did not institute an income cap on who can participate, so taxpayers continue to subsidize the richest Oklahomans who least need financial support even while cutting funding to CareerTech.
Accountability for private schools accepting those tax credits: F Legislators still refuse to require private schools that accept state money to undergo the same rigorous testing and report cards that we require of our public schools, so how do we know we’re getting good bang for buck? As if that isn’t enough, lawmakers went a step further this year to muddy the accountability waters by cheerfully voting to hide the names of people accepting as much as $7,500 in state subsidies. The state Tax Commission had barely published a list of those who had received hundreds of millions in our tax dollars before lawmakers freaked out, insisting “family privacy” trumps fiscal transparency in Oklahoma. They conveniently ignored the fact that nobody is being forced to apply for these funds, this secrecy flies in the face of how we treat other tax credit program recipients, and taxpayers deserve to know who is accepting government handouts. Stitt happily inked his name on that bill. Why are lawmakers so terrified to prove that this is money well spent?
Incentivizing good, experienced teachers to want to work in Oklahoma classrooms:  C  Much to the disappointment of early- and mid-career educators, lawmakers did not boost the salaries of all classroom teachers. They did extend the salary schedule to 35 years, meaning a teacher with 35 years experience can now make no less than $60,973 a year. Previously, the salary schedule capped out at 25 years or a minimum of $56,049. Lawmakers also opened Oklahoma’s Promise college scholarship program, which pays resident tuition at a public college, to classroom teachers with at least a decade of experience. Lawmakers again did nothing to boost support staff pay.
Early voting access: F We have the worst voter turnout rates in the country, and will continue to do so after lawmakers conveniently “forgot” the fact that their constituents waited for hours in line during the last election to vote. Going into session, there was bipartisan enthusiasm surrounding the idea of expanding the early voting window to increase access. But those went nowhere this year. Now a little more than a year out from the state’s major election cycle, in which we’ll elect a new governor and new legislative members, Republicans have shown they’re perfectly happy with low turnout.
If you’re keeping track, that brings the Oklahoma Legislature to about a C average grade for the session. Here’s hoping they can bring up their GPA and our state’s overall quality of life next year. 
I’ll have my grading pen ready.

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Idaho rancher Jay Smith has a wolf problem.
Over the last 20 years, Smith said wolves have killed more than 200 of his cattle and caused major financial harm to his family’s business.
﻿
“At today’s value at nearly $2,000 a head, times that by 200 and see if we could have invested that money over time what would that have been?” Smith said. “Significant.”
Smith and his wife, Chyenne, raise Black Angus cattle near the town of Carmen, a tiny community near the Continental Divide, just west of the Montana border.
Jay grew up nearby; his family has been ranching in the area since 1924.
Last year, the family celebrated its centennial on the land.
But their history goes back even longer.
Smith has a family history book documenting cattle ownership back to the 1600s.
“So my family’s cattle raising lineage goes way back,” Smith said.
There’s something else that goes way back in Smith’s family: Warnings about wolves that have been passed down through the generations.
 Idaho rancher ‘got to be a cowboy every day’ of his life

The J Lazy S Angus Ranch is situated in a green valley set in the shadows of high mountain peaks, some of which rise above 10,000 feet.
Wildfire smoke often hangs in the air during the summer. And on the other side of the valley, the Salmon River cuts through the landscape.

The ranch features a classic red barn, a horse corral, an assortment of farm machinery and a renovated old cabin surrounded by shade trees.
They have a small herd of Morgan-Quarter Horse crossbreeds and an array of cattle dogs that go everywhere with the Smiths, including high up in the surrounding mountains.
“One of the main reasons Chyenne and I bought this place is A, because ranching is in my blood,” Smith said. “But B, it’s exactly how we wanted to raise our children. I wanted them to have the work ethic and the animal husbandry background that I grew up with. I think it’s very important.”
Running cattle and working the ranch is all he’s ever known, and Smith wouldn’t trade it for anything.
“I don’t know if you ever watch TV, but I got to be a cowboy every day of my life, so I don’t know how you go wrong there,” Smith said. “(There is) a lot of freedom. These ranches are big, and so we had a lot of private property where us kids could go a long ways without getting in trouble or being in the wrong spot. And I don’t know how a city kid could ever get their head around that, but we could literally go for miles and not be somewhere we shouldn’t be.”
 Ranching and living in wolf ground zero

The Smiths’ several hundred cattle have a lot of room to roam, too.
During summers, the cows live in the high country. They spend 12 to 16 weeks each in a cow camp way up in the mountains, roaming far and wide on public land.
And that’s where they run into trouble with wolves.
Only a few ridgelines separate Smith’s ranch from wolf ground zero: one of the original sites of reintroduction 30 years ago – Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
From their porch on the ranch, Jay and Chyenne Smith can see the Diamond Moose Grazing allotment, where wolves have a track record killing and harassing livestock, Smith said.

“It’s been one of the most consistently conflicted allotments throughout the years,” Smith said.
Jay Smith was 22 years old in 1995 when the government reintroduced wolves. He has seen ranching before wolves were reintroduced and the difference the animals made after they were reintroduced.
“We worked really hard to keep (reintroduction) from happening,” Smith said. “And then when it became inevitable and we could see the writing on the wall, then we started trying to position ourselves for how to live with the inevitable. It was coming. We’ve been here 100 years. We’re not leaving. So now how do we make this work?”
 Idaho rancher affected by wolf depredation says compensation hard to come by

Not only do the wolves literally eat into their business, but every time the Smiths or other ranchers speak out or try to do something about it, they say they are vilified.
“The negativity and the hate towards ranchers is worse than the wolves, in my opinion, and it’s because the public’s been fed this fairy tale of what wolves are,” Chyenne Smith said. “And we’re the bad guys in every one of those stories.”
Jay Smith said he hasn’t seen a nickel in compensation for the livestock wolves killed.
“We have been paid for zero head ever,” he said.
Although Smith said he hasn’t been paid for any of his livestock losses, other Idaho ranchers have.

The state of Idaho has a compensation program to reimburse livestock owners the fair market value of animals that are killed by wolves or grizzly bears.
It applies to cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, chicken, llamas and even bees – basically any animal used for food or in food production.
From 2014 to 2022, the state of Idaho’s livestock compensation program paid out $687,029.50 to 299 different livestock producers for compensation for verified livestock losses, state records show.
But to be paid, livestock owners must have a confirmed wolf kill claim filed with the Office of Species Conservation each year.
“In the topography we run in, we can’t find them in time,” Smith said. “They just simply don’t come home. We’ll find a pile of bones. We’ll find wolf scat right on top of those bones. I mean, we know what happened to them. But as far as Wildlife Services coming in and being able to make a confirmation report to send to the Office of Species Conservation to put us in the reimbursement program, we are zero for 200. That’s our batting average.”
State records show that most investigations of wolf complaints don’t conclude that wolves were definitely responsible.
From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, Idaho Wildlife Services investigated 99 complaints of livestock losses blamed on wolves, state records show. About 28% of those investigations ruled wolves’ responsibility for livestock deaths were “confirmed” or “probable.”
But more than two-thirds of the wolf complaints, about 68%, were classified as “possible/unknown.” In some cases, wolves may have eaten the carcass of livestock after the animal was already dead but did kill the animal.
Smith said his losses add up.
“We have lost over 200 head of livestock in that 20-plus years to wolves,” Jay Smith said.
“One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero,” he added. “And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk. It’s very variable, and it’s very unknown. But it’s remained over the years. It hasn’t gone away. It sounds like it’s come and gone, but the wolves are still back there.”
And even if wolves don’t kill livestock like cows and sheep, even the presence of wolves can distress animals enough that they aren’t as healthy and wouldn’t be worth as much at market.
But wolf supporters say the number of livestock killed is extremely low. In Idaho, Montana and Wyoming wolves are confirmed to have killed an average of less than 300 domestic animals per year – out of 6 million cows and sheep in those states.
But even if the overall numbers and percentages are low, the cost is high for the farming and ranching families like the Smiths.
With 30 years of experience since reintroduction and all the claims made by wolf advocates and all the meetings with the feds, nothing has changed Smith’s mind about wolves.
He opposed reintroducing wolves, and now that they are here, Smith thinks there are too many of them. As a result, he thinks ranchers should be given broad authority to kill wolves to protect their livestock.
And as the chairman of his local county’s Republican Party central committee, Smith has helped make that happen. He said he co-wrote a 2021 state law that helped make it easier to kill more wolves by expanding when and how they can be hunted and trapped.
The law allows hunters to purchase an unlimited number of wolf tags to kill wolves and makes trapping on private land legal year round.
“There’s still people vehemently against every proposal we have,” Smith said. “And I don’t know why. We’re not out to kill them all. We’re just out to make a living and keep our livelihoods.”
Chyenne Smith agreed.
“It’s about not being able to do everything we can to protect what’s ours when we need to,” she said.
 The role trapping plays in the wolf v. livestock debate

When there are problems with wolves harassing or killing livestock, ranchers often call on trappers to catch the predators.
And one of the best people at trapping wolves is Rusty Kramer.

He’s the president of the Idaho Trappers Association and the incoming president of the National Trappers Association.

Whether it’s badgers, beavers, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, muskrats or wolves, if it’s legal to trap in Idaho, Kramer has probably caught it.
Depending on the animals, he’s used scent lures, bait or even blind set traps, hoping to entice an animal to step on a silver dollar-sized pan, which triggers the trap’s jaws to lose around the wolf’s foot and seize hold.
Once a wolf is trapped, Kramer shoots it behind the shoulder with his .22 magnum pistol, killing it. Since wolves were reintroduced, he’s trapped and killed 25 to 30.
Kramer was born and raised in Fairfield, Idaho, near the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho.
“I just learned how to trap looking over my dad’s shoulder and riding around with him and just kind of fell in love with it as a kid and I’ve been doing it ever since,” Kramer said.
It started as damage control, trapping ground squirrels and marmots, also known as rock chucks, to protect the alfalfa. Later, he moved on to coyotes and muskrats.
Kramer’s father taught him how to process and sell the pelts, stressing the importance of using every part of the animal. As a kid, the pelts put a little extra money in his pocket.
For him, trapping is a way of life and a family tradition.
Today, Kramer said the Idaho Trappers Association runs the largest fur sale in the United States, in Glenns Ferry, where a trapper can make good money for a wolf pelt.
A quality wolf pelt can go for $500 or more.
For 10 years as an adult, Kramer lived in Boise – the state’s largest city – about a 90-minute drive from Fairfield. After Micron Technology laid him off, Kramer returned to Fairfield.
But it’s tough to make a living on trapping alone, and Kramer also runs an alfalfa farm and is the watermaster for his local water district.
It’s the farm where Kramer and other farmers run into trouble with wolves. Ever since wolves came back, Kramer says, a lot more elk are hanging out in the valley where he and many other farmers grow alfalfa. He says the elk hang out there to keep safe from wolves, who tend to avoid agricultural areas because of the human presence. The elk trample the fields and eat the alfalfa, creating a headache and a cost for Rusty.
“I don’t hate wolves,” Kramer said. “I very (much) admire wolves. How far they can roam and how cunning they are and survive out there.”
But he thinks it was a mistake to reintroduce wolves to Idaho.
“I’m under the opinion it would be cool to snap your fingers and it’s back to ‘Dances with Wolves’ days,” Kramer said, referring to the 1990 movie starring Kevin Costner. “You know, where it’s buffalo from Ohio to Oregon and grizzlies and wolves. But there’s only so many places that grizzlies, wolves and buffalo can have in the 21st century, because they just roam so far. These aren’t foxes and coyotes that can live around humans.”
“There’s just not enough space for them in the 21st century, in my opinion,” Kramer said.
 Does Idaho’s Wood River Wolf Project offer a solution to protecting livestock from wolves?

Suzanne Asha Stone is trying to to demonstrate that ranchers can live side-by-side with wolves today.
Thirty years ago, Stone was an intern working on the wolf reintroduction project. Since then, she’s become a prominent wolf expert and advocate.
She is the executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project in Idaho.

Lately, Stone has been focusing on helping ranchers protect sheep and cattle without killing wolves.
Stone said the catalyst for the work was a “train wreck” of conflict between wolves and sheep in 2007 in central Idaho’s Blaine County.
Unaware that wolves were denning with pups in the area, a rancher let out his flock of sheep with some livestock guardian dogs for protection, Stone said.
“So to wolves, having those dogs come in meant that they had strange wolves coming in and were a significant threat to their pups,” Stone said. “The rancher, of course, didn’t know this. He had no idea that the wolves were there. But within 24 hours, we had dead sheep, dead livestock guardian dogs and a (wolf) pack with a death warrant on their head.”
Stone said the community came together after the event to look for a way to project sheep and wolves.
“It was at that time that the residents of Blaine County pushed back hard and said, ‘We really enjoy having wolves here. We had our own little Yellowstone happening right in our backyard, where we could go out and watch these wolves and their pups, and we want to keep them alive,’” Stone said.
From there, Stone sat down at the table with ranchers in the area, as well as an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services.
Stone said just about everyone was skeptical, even wolf biologists who wanted to keep more wolves alive.
“And so we sat down with all of them and then reached out to the ranchers and just said, ‘Let us try these nonlethal tools. Now everybody’s telling us we’re going to fail, but let’s try and see what happens,’” Stone said.
Stone started using something called fladry.
It’s nothing more than a barrier of waving flags, but it has proven successful to deter wolves in Eastern Europe and help sell high-mileage Hondas stateside.
“It looks like the flagging that sits around used car lots, basically,” Stone said. “It doesn’t look intimidating to us at all. Wolves don’t like it. They don’t trust it. And so we were able to keep the sheep behind those fladry pens for the rest of the season without having a single other loss. And the wolves were right there raising their pups for a good part of that summer. No more incidents at all.”
Stone’s critics called it beginner’s luck and questioned whether she could replicate her results over long periods of time or large areas.
That led to the creation of the Wood River Wolf Project, which for the last 17 summers has been partnering with ranchers in the area to use non-lethal tools and techniques to protect sheep from wolves.
The project area covers about 4,600 square miles of rugged, mountainous terrain.
Stone says there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to wolf conflicts – different terrain, different predator behavior, even varying access to electricity can affect what works. So, she’ll try just about anything – and her group has over the years. They’ve used solar-powered strobe lights, blasted air horns, played recordings of helicopters, even had cowboys play music.
In one case, wolves were feasting on llamas at an eastern Oregon ranch. So Stone’s team set up those 20-foot air dancers you see at car lots and lit them up at night.
“So when the wolves came over the top of the hill, they saw this enormous monster up there flapping around and making all kinds of noise, and oh my gosh, they were in the next county the next day,” she said.
“We’ve only lost two wolves in the 17 years now of the project and an average of less than five sheep a year for that entire 17-year period,” Stone said. “So it’s the lowest loss of livestock to wolves in any area where wolves and livestock overlap in the Western United States, probably beyond that. It’s a very successful project, and we use less money than what they do to kill wolves outside of the project area, where they’re losing more livestock there.”
But Stone hasn’t convinced everyone. In fact, one key holdout is her own state government.
Even when nonlethal methods of wolf control are available, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s written policy preference is to kill wolves to reduce the overall wolf population in the state.
“A lot of what we’ve learned here is being applied in countries all over the world, just not in the state of Idaho, and not to any real extent beyond our project area, because the state is so determined to kill wolves rather than to live with them,” Stone said.

New rules allow members of the public and state employees to go armed in government buildings, with exceptions including courthouses and law enforcement facilities. 
The post Concealed carry allowed in many Wyoming state government buildings starting Tuesday appeared first on WyoFile .","Starting Tuesday, Wyomingites will be allowed to carry guns into state government buildings, with some exceptions including courthouses and law enforcement facilities.
On June 17, the Wyoming State Building Commission — composed of the governor, treasurer, state auditor, secretary of state and superintendent of public education — adopted rules allowing concealed carry in most state government buildings in preparation for a new law that takes effect Tuesday repealing “gun-free” zones in government buildings.
The new rules mark a major expansion of where citizens can carry firearms as they conduct business with their government. That expansion comes at the behest of the Legislature and over the objections of Gov. Mark Gordon, who sought to implement concealed carry into Wyoming’s state buildings through a rule-making process overseen by the building commission. But lawmakers passed their repeal bill with a veto-proof majority this year. Gordon nixed a previous version in 2024.
The Legislature’s drive to open state government buildings to armed citizens coincides with concerns about increased political violence in America. Earlier this month, a man assassinated a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband and nearly killed another lawmaker and his partner. That violence came on the heels of an arson attack on Pennsylvania’s governor, and months after a campaign season in which two people tried to assassinate President Donald Trump. 
Lawmakers who pushed for the concealed carry bill, which passed the Senate with a 25-6 vote and the House with a 50-10 vote, believe allowing citizens to go armed and defend themselves is the antidote to such violence. Opponents fear more guns in more places will lead to more deaths and injuries, both accidental and deliberate.
This winter, public areas of the Wyoming State Capitol were opened to concealed carry. You do not need a permit to concealed carry a lawfully purchased firearm in the Equality State.
Separately, the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information issued a new policy allowing state employees to concealed carry but required them to store firearms in a locked box when it is not on their person.

That policy does not require employees to have taken gun safety or active shooter courses, though it says they are “strongly encouraged” to do so. 
Exceptions to the new rules include the Wyoming Judiciary, where bailiffs go armed but members of the public are forbidden to carry weapons into courtrooms. The public is also not allowed to carry firearms into facilities primarily used by law enforcement, including jails, prisons and agency offices like those of the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation. 
Concealed carry will also remain prohibited in treatment facilities operated by the health department and field offices of the Wyoming Department of Family Services. Those exceptions were all included in the Legislature’s repeal bill. 
Around the state, Wyoming school boards have struggled to write new policies to conform with the law, which also forced the allowance of concealed carry in public schools. That response on a local level has highlighted the political differences between counties, WyoFile reported in collaboration with news outlets around the state.
The process for state government has been more subdued. The State Building Commission’s emergency meeting to adopt the new rules featured only one public commenter, who brought to officials a concern about a piece of wording in the law he thought violated legislative intent. The Wyoming Public Employee Association, which represents state workers across different agencies, didn’t take a position, Executive Director Betty Jo Beardsley told WyoFile.
Her members fall on both sides of the debate about whether gun-free zones are safer or targets for people who want to do harm, she said.
The emergency rules may only last until July 9, Wyoming State Building Commission Secretary Suzanne Nelson told WyoFile in an interview Wednesday. On that day, the five elected officials are scheduled to meet again and are likely to adopt permanent rules that echo the emergency rules going into effect Tuesday. 
Though lawmakers had given the executive branch 30 days to implement rules after the law went into effect, Nelson said officials wanted to have rules in place when the law took effect.  
Posted signs of a “no” symbol over the silhouette of a handgun will indicate those buildings or spaces within buildings where concealed carry is prohibited, Nelson said.

The predictable outcome is a further funneling of wealth into the pockets of high earners, at the direct expense of the already threadbare social safety net that supports communities across our nation, argues Pete Gosar.
The post Rural health clinics like mine will bear the burden of Congress’s Medicaid cuts appeared first on WyoFile .","The “$1.5 trillion in tax cuts” that Congress’s “Big Beautiful Bill” seeks to extend is not merely a fiscal policy; it is a profound sacrifice. 

Opinion

This sacrifice will not be borne by those who stand to gain, but by the very fabric of our society: our key social programs like Medicaid and SNAP benefits. The predictable outcome is a further funneling of wealth into the pockets of high earners, at the direct expense of the already threadbare social safety net that supports communities across our nation. As the director of a free primary care facility, I am dismayed by the callous lack of compassion Congress is demonstrating for financially strapped Americans.
The burden of care, inevitably, will fall upon the shoulders of free clinics like the Downtown Clinic in Laramie, where I have worked for over a decade. For the low-income, uninsured individuals we serve — those without Medicare, Medicaid, or VA benefits — the emergency room is often their only other recourse. We strive to provide high-quality, integrated healthcare, but when the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill would remove 10.9 million people from Medicaid and 5.1 million from the Affordable Care Act, it forces a chilling question: Where will these 16 million vulnerable Americans go?
In America today, 2 million people already receive essential care through free clinics like ours. Last year alone, the Free Clinic Association reported 6 million patient visits. We are proud to do this vital work, and 90% of our funding is derived from privately raised dollars. But how, I ask, do you expect an additional 12 to 16 million people to enter this system without a shred of additional financial support? This puts clinics like ours in an utterly precarious situation. It is, as I see it, nothing less than a cost shift from the federal government, designed solely to funnel tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. That is not the America I believe in.
The damage extends catastrophically to rural healthcare. It’s estimated that this bill will lead to over $50 billion in lost Medicaid reimbursements over the next 10 years. The proposed $15 billion rural healthcare fund is, quite frankly, a disingenuous band-aid — an admission by our representatives in Congress that they recognize the harm this bill will inflict upon rural communities. This meager fund doesn’t begin to cover the projected losses, nor will it prevent the eventual shutdown of vital rural hospitals. If Congress truly wished to support rural healthcare, they would ensure people have access to healthcare in the first place, rather than offering inadequate props after inflicting such profound damage.
The America I was raised to believe in is one that values communities and supports neighbors. Growing up in Wyoming, at an elevation of 7,000 feet, if you saw a car on the side of the road in the winter, it could literally be a life-or-death situation. You didn’t hesitate; you pulled over, checked on them, offered help, a tow, or a ride to town. You checked in on your neighbors, feeding their animals when they were away. The values of looking out for each other, of community responsibility, are core to Americans, especially in rural communities. We must continue to embody that spirit.
This bill does not. There is a direct, undeniable line from the cuts in Medicaid and SNAP benefits to the enrichment of the richest few. Is this truly what Congress desires for our nation? I believe the American public does not want more income inequality. They want a country where we care for our neighbors, where a social safety net supports those in need, and where healthcare is a right, not a privilege reserved for the wealthy. 
It’s time for Congress to listen to the American people and reconsider a bill that fundamentally betrays our shared values.

He introduced himself as a fisherman of 50 years to a stranger seated next to him at the banquet table.
“That sounds really hard,” the other man replied. 
“Not as hard as it’s going to be to go accept this award and talk to a room full of people,” joked Yerman. Moments later, his name was called, and he walked onto a professionally lit stage to accept a small crystal trophy from the Oceantic Network, a leading trade group for the burgeoning multibillion-dollar U.S. offshore wind industry.
It was an unlikely sight. America’s fishermen have long treated wind developers as their sworn enemies. 
The conflict started in the early 2000s, when the first plans for New England’s offshore wind areas were sketched out. In packed town hall meetings that often devolved into shouting matches, fishermen claimed the projects would make it harder to earn a living: fewer fishing grounds, fewer fish, damaged ocean habitat. 
Few of these predictions have come to pass in places like the U.K., which has already built over 50 offshore wind farms in its waters. Wind areas there are thriving with sharks and serving as a surprising habitat for haddock. But even today, fisher-led groups in the U.S. are spearheading lawsuits aiming to halt at least two offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast. One former offshore wind executive told Canary Media that the amount of pushback from fishermen in America has made offshore wind investments riskier than in Europe.
Yerman was one of the first fishermen in the U.S. to cross this bitter divide. He’s become the reluctant face of a group of over 100 fishermen and fisherwomen who go by the name Sea Services North America. They’ve decided to work for offshore wind farms — not against them. Doing so supplements their income from scalloping, a centuries-old bedrock of the New England fishing economy that has seen revenues dry up. 
Pursuing work in wind power has come at a cost. After the awards event, back in blue jeans and with a celebratory beer in hand, Yerman recounted the exact word New England fishermen used when he and his crew first crossed the Rubicon.
“They called us traitors,” he said.  
Those tensions have become supercharged with the election of President Donald Trump, who has called offshore wind “garbage” and “bullshit” and, in the weeks leading up to his inauguration, pledged that​ “no new windmills” would be built in the U.S. during his presidency. He’s backed up those words with action since taking office, stopping new projects from proceeding and attempting to block some of the country’s eight fully permitted offshore wind projects, too. 
Yerman and his crew are left wondering if the industry they’ve bet their livelihood on — and work they’ve risked their reputations for — will all come crashing down. 
Many of the fishermen who work through Sea Services voted for Trump. And if the president fulfills his promise to halt the industry, it would be devastating not only for the Northeast’s climate goals and grid reliability — but for thousands of workers in the region, from electricians to welders to Sea Services’ fishermen.
One of Sea Services’ captains, Kevin Souza, put it simply: The impact would be “big time.”
“Everyone was skeptical”
Six years ago, Yerman was like the others — angry with offshore wind developers, particularly Danish giant Ørsted, which had set up shop in his hometown of New London, Connecticut. 
Concerned that wind turbines might push his son out of the scalloping business, he pulled one of the only levers he could think to pull and contacted his state senator at the time, Paul Formica, a Republican who owned a local seafood restaurant. 
Formica wanted to see the two sides get along. He arranged a meeting between Yerman and an Ørsted executive named Matthew Morrissey, who happened to be a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, the most lucrative commercial fishing port in America.

Yerman found in Morrissey a sympathetic ear, and in turn, he listened to what the executive had to say — that Ørsted was open to partnering with fishermen. Morrissey had seen, with his own eyes, fishers working for and coexisting with Ørsted in a tiny port in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. The energy firm had a team of about two dozen marine affairs employees, Morrissey relayed, who could help make something like that happen in America if Yerman was on board. He pitched it as a win-win. 
“Everyone knows that fishermen hate offshore wind companies. Well, guess what? Offshore wind companies hate fishermen, too,” Morrissey, who no longer works at Ørsted, told Canary Media earlier this year. “Our goal here is to spread the understanding that these two industries can and do and will work together.”
The idea intrigued Yerman. In the U.S., profits from scalloping have fluctuated from year to year, and, following a crash in the 1990s, scallop numbers remain unpredictable. In his view, if offshore wind companies were moving into their waters — like it or not — they might as well make some money from it. 
Yerman got to work. 
His first call was to Gordon Videll, a longtime friend and affable small-town lawyer, who knew things about contracts that Yerman didn’t. The two flew to Kilkeel — on their own dime — to see the model for themselves. Videll noticed that some of Kilkeel’s fishermen were driving cars nicer than his. He and Yerman were inspired.  
When they returned to Connecticut, Yerman recruited about a half dozen of his commercial fishing buddies, and Videll started putting together the paperwork. They dubbed themselves Sea Services North America and in 2020 landed their first small contract, with Ørsted. It was a pilot, said Morrissey, to see if this arrangement would work here in America. 
“Everyone was skeptical,” recalled Morrissey with a laugh. “Because their boats were in such poor safety condition. But you know what? They pulled it off.” 
Today, Sea Services operates like a co-op and has brought 22 fishing boats up to certified safety standards. With Videll at the helm as part-time CEO, the group has completed over 11 contracts in eight different wind farm areas, from Massachusetts to New Jersey. Instead of hiring ferries or work boats, developers rely on Sea Services fishermen to provide safety and scout services for offshore wind vessels. 
It’s important work: making sure, for example, no fishing gear, like crab traps, is in the way of cables, monopiles, or survey operations. If necessary, Sea Services fishermen move gear — with the owner’s approval. When not cleared, these obstacles have caused days and sometimes weeks of costly delays for developers, according to Morrissey. 
Sea Services was an “indispensable partner” in helping to build South Fork Wind, which went online last year and became America’s first large-scale offshore wind project, wrote Ed LeBlanc, a current Ørsted executive, in an email to Canary Media. The firm has since contracted the group for other projects, in no small part because of their expertise about local waters, he added.
Cooperation between these two sides — offshore wind and commercial fishing — does exist elsewhere in America. For example, Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, the codevelopers of the Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out $8 million directly to local fishermen unaffiliated with Sea Services for similar safety jobs over the past two years.
But Sea Services is unique. Today the group offers an expansive network of 22 partner vessels based in six states and is led by a commercial fisherman. Videll brought on new technology, allowing developers to track their work in real time. He said they adopted a co-op model to maximize the amount of money going into participants’ pockets. 
Receiving the Oceantic Network award in late April was a big deal for the collective, said Videll. It’s an example of how successful the venture has been in a short period of time — and, more importantly, it should be good for business. Industry awards mean visibility. More visibility could mean more Sea Services contracts.

But, right now, the Sea Services business faces headwinds that no award can help overcome. 
Since taking office in January, President Trump has launched an all-out assault on the offshore wind industry. On his first day in office, he halted new lease and permitting activity and called for a review of the nine projects that already had their federal permits in hand. In March, his Environmental Protection Agency chief revoked a key permit for Atlantic Shores, a fully permitted project that has since been called off in part due to roadblocks created by the administration. 
The most eyebrow-raising step came in April, when Trump’s Interior Department issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind 1, two weeks after the project had begun at-sea construction.
It was a wake-up call for Sea Services, which works for Norwegian energy giant Equinor on the project. Videll, Sea Services’ CEO, said at the time that the cessation of Empire Wind would be a crushing blow that could cost the co-op a total of $9 million to $12 million worth of work. 
In May, the administration suddenly lifted the stop-work order. Sea Services’ contract was safe, at least for the time being. But it was the most bracing illustration yet that the business, in spite of all its success, now faces very choppy waters under the Trump administration. 
Taking a risk
On a cloudless late-February day at the New Bedford port, 57-year-old Souza hovered over a checklist and laptop in the captain’s quarters of the Pamela Ann. Souza is the captain of the boat, and he needed to make sure everything was in order before he and his crew left New Bedford that afternoon. They’d be at sea for 10 days, working in many of the spots Souza had fished in for decades. 
Those 10 days at sea would not be spent dredging up scallops from the seafloor and tallying their catch, however, but conducting safety operations for the Revolution Wind offshore wind project, which is being built off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
The hulking scalloping boat, with its ebony-painted hull and wood-paneled interior, was bustling ahead of the journey. In the galley, Souza’s 25-year-old son, one of the three mates onboard, sorted through the food they’d need. Jack Morris, a 73-year-old scalloper and Sea Services manager, paced around the Pamela Ann checking in on its recently updated safety assets, like a new tracking beacon and safety suits. 
Trips like these have become a lifeline for Souza, his crew, and an increasing number of fishermen who depend on the struggling scalloping industry. 
Today, there are roughly 350 vessels sitting in ports from Maine to North Carolina that have licenses to harvest sea scallops. For several decades, East Coast scallopers managed to eke out a comfortable middle-class lifestyle on scalloping alone. Morris said that “years ago” he’d pull in $200,000 to $300,000 of profit annually as a scallop boat captain.
“Yeah, those days are gone,” scoffed Morris. 
While the price of scallops remains high, making it one of the most lucrative U.S. fisheries, rules passed over the last 30 years have restricted when and where scallopers can harvest, resulting in fewer days at sea, fewer scallops caught — and less money for the entire industry.

Souza has mixed emotions about the regulations.
On the one hand, scallops are no longer being overfished. A 2024 third-party audit of the fishery said it “meets the requirements for a well-managed and sustainable fishery.” In fact, for over a decade, U.S. sea scallops sold on grocery store shelves have carried a little blue-check label — the mark of a seafood certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.
But most scallop fishermen are now limited to an extremely short window of time during which they can harvest scallops— in 2025, it was just 24 days. Some of their favorite fishing grounds are regularly closed for scallop recovery. There are simply fewer scallops to go around. Souza estimates that captains who stick to scalloping alone are making half of what they did in years past: “They’re probably lucky to make a hundred [thousand].”
Offshore wind work has helped fishermen like Souza and Morris ease the sting of that lost income. 
Across Revolution Wind’s two-year construction window, Souza expects to make over $200,000 as a part-time boat captain. For the younger generation, who Souza said as deckhands can expect to make only around $30,000 per year from scalloping, offshore wind work makes it possible to keep earning a middle-class wage. 
In the past year, Souza has recruited to Sea Services both of his sons, his nephew, and a few other young folks from longtime fishing families who might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income.
“This wind farm business is the number one way for scallop guys, captains, mates, deckhands, to make extra money,” said Morris.
It’s also helping to revitalize the port of New Bedford, a city of 100,000 that is not only the most valuable fishing port in America but also a place of tremendous historic importance to the industry. It was once the epicenter of the whaling world and serves as the backdrop for the opening scenes of Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick.” 
In just 10 years, the offshore wind industry has ushered in a transformation the city hadn’t seen “since the whaling era,” according to Jon Mitchell, the city’s mayor since 2011. 
The companies building Vineyard Wind now stage their offshore wind infrastructure in New Bedford. Their presence has brought a flood of public and private funding to the city, with over $1.2 billion already invested and pledged to help give the terminals, docks, and harbor a facelift, according to Mitchell.

For all the money offshore wind has brought to the city — and into the pockets of locals like Souza and Morris — offshore wind remains highly controversial among many commercial fishermen in New Bedford. 
That’s in spite of Mitchell’s insistence that, when push comes to shove, New Bedford’s local government will always side with scalloping. 
Still, Mitchell, one of New England’s fiercest offshore wind defenders, remains unpopular with many down at the boat docks. “I’ve put myself in the loneliest place in American politics, which is right in the middle. Between offshore wind and commercial fishing,” he said. 
Trump flags, full pockets
The fishermen who take part in Sea Services also float in that lonely place. 
It’s not uncommon for them to face harassment from other fishermen over the radio when out on the water, Yerman said. One time, he said a Sea Services fisherman was turned away from a Rhode Island dock, in what Yerman characterized as an act of revenge. 
The hardest part of Yerman’s job is overcoming this cultural aversion and getting fishermen to the table, convincing them that working for the offshore wind developers is a way to sustain a livelihood whose viability has begun to fade.  
“You’ll have the lobster guys and they’ll say shit to you — like, ‘traitor.’ Or ‘Trump’s gonna shut that down, ha ha ha,’” Souza said, imitating the taunts he receives over the marine radio bolted to the wall near the helm of the Pamela Ann. 
The lobstermen have a point regarding Trump. As frustrating as their remarks may be, the biggest threat to offshore wind is not snipes from colleagues, but the actions of a president who many Sea Services members — including Souza — voted for.

As Souza prepared to leave the New Bedford port in February to go help Ørsted build giant wind turbines in the ocean, something Trump swore would not happen during his term, he explained his support for the president.
“Trust me, I want Trump to ‘drill, drill, drill.’ I’m all for it,” said Souza of the president’s plans to expand oil and gas production. 
But he still thinks offshore wind is necessary to get more power onto New England’s grid and lower energy costs. Experts say that the federal permitting process for offshore wind in America takes too long — about four years. But, in the Northeast region, according to energy analyst Christian Roselund, finishing the deployment of the offshore wind projects already in the permitting pipeline will be much faster than starting up new nuclear or fossil-gas power plants.  
“Once we ‘drill, drill, drill,’ you’re still gonna need more electricity,” Souza said. “Where are you gonna get it? My electric bill at my house is stupid high!”
Most of the fishermen in New Bedford are Trump supporters, he insisted. Morris, who also voted for Trump, agreed. Overall, Trump won 46% of the city’s votes in last November’s election — a much higher proportion than his Massachusetts statewide total of 36.5%. The “TRUMP 2024” flags flown from the dozens of scallop boats docked across New Bedford’s port underscored the point. A few of those Trump flag-flying boats even work for the offshore wind companies, Morris claims. The Pamela Ann, for its part, does not have a Trump flag. 
“I support Trump even though I know he’s against wind. … I believe this will still be around,” said Souza, gesturing toward the ocean, where somewhere over the horizon an array of wind towers was being erected. “He’s gonna see the light.” 
Trump, of course, has not seen the light — though he did revoke his stop-work order against Empire Wind. 
After being grounded for a month, Sea Services fishermen began operations on Empire Wind again in early June, when the project resumed at-sea work. The co-op’s members are helping Equinor’s construction vessels lay boulders on the seafloor to stabilize all 54 wind towers that will be raised over the next two years and eventually supply much-needed carbon-free power to New York City. 
But nothing is certain. When the Trump administration unpaused the project, it left open the door to stopping it again — or killing it altogether. A May letter from the Interior Department to Equinor noted that it is still conducting an “ongoing review” to determine if the project’s permits were “rushed” and therefore illegitimate in the eyes of the Trump administration. 
Meanwhile, a coalition of a dozen fishing companies and several anti-offshore wind groups typically allied with Trump sued the administration on June 3, just days before Empire Wind restarted at-sea construction, in an attempt to reinstate the stop-work order. The move came weeks after wind opponents asked Trump to also pause Revolution Wind, one of the more lucrative contracts Sea Services holds.
In his opposition to offshore wind, Trump has positioned himself as a defender of the commercial fishing industry, claiming falsely at a May 2024 campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, for example, that the turbines “cause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales.”  
But for the increasing number of fishermen working with offshore wind companies, halting the industry would not help — it would crush a financial lifeline.
Not long ago, in 2017, Sea Services captain Rodney Avila remembers being one of the only fishers in New Bedford willing to seize this lifeline. He recalled with a laugh what a long-time fisherman friend said to him then: “When you put that first wind turbine up there … we’re going to hang you from it!”
Times have changed. In the New Bedford area, almost 50 local fishing vessels have performed some kind of safety or scouting work for Vineyard Wind. At least one captain lowers his MAGA-supporting flag before setting out to work on the projects the president has sworn to stop, according to Avila. He said politics has always been tangled up in fishing. And work is work. 
“They don’t care whether it’s red, or blue, or whatever color. … They don’t care,” Avila shrugged, while sipping coffee inside a Dunkin’. Five scalloping boats bobbed on calm water just beyond the parking lot. “It’s money that they need to support their families, wherever it comes from.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3738-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

Bill Lee signs his signature private school voucher law. (Photo: John Partipilo/ Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee House Republican says the legislature should require the Department of Education to provide more information about private-school voucher applicants for a thorough evaluation of the new program.
Parents applying for the money don’t have to disclose where their children attended school previously, and the state is refusing to provide that information or even the counties where students live. 
Additionally, applications for “universal” vouchers, those without an income cap, don’t require parents to list financial information.
Lawmakers who opposed the program are raising questions about what they perceive as critical information as the state offers nearly $7,300 each to 20,000 students to enroll in private schools, at a total cost of $146 million. Half the recipients, 10,000, have financial limits at 300% of the federal poverty level, an estimated $175,000 for a family of four, while the families of the remainder face no income restrictions.
  “It seems fairly clear that the (Lee) administration does not want to know these things,” said Rep. Jody Barrett, R-Dickson, of a lack of information released on private school voucher applicants. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“It seems fairly clear that the administration does not want to know these things because they’re afraid it may not line up with the narrative that was put out there for the reason they were supporting this measure,” Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson told the Lookout.
Numerous lawmakers said during debate they supported the private-school vouchers to help struggling parents send their children to better schools.
Chalkbeat initially reported on the matter and found two-thirds or more of the students in Alabama and Florida who received voucher funds already attended private schools.
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is among the lawmakers trying to obtain what he called “basic” information about the voucher program to make sure it complies with the law.
“They’re giving out checks like Cash for Clunkers,” Hemmer said, comparing it to a 2009 federal rebate program designed to bolster the economy and encourage people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.  
Lawmakers narrowly passed Gov. Bill Lee’s main initiative this year even though the state’s own financial impact analysis showed 65% of the students who receive the vouchers would be enrolled in private schools already. Students from private schools surrounded the governor when he signed the bill into law at the State Capitol.
Barrett, who voted against the measure this year, said he requested information about students’ previous enrollment and home counties after the Education Department’s first release showed only ZIP codes. Barrett added that he asked the department to provide the home counties for applicants so lawmakers could assess the demand and tailor the program to serve students.
In contrast, the state’s Education Savings Account program for low-income students in Metro Nashville, Memphis and Chattanooga requires parents to provide financial information.
“This department just seems like they’re intent on intentionally not understanding those things. Or they’re not disclosing that information,” Barrett said.
Tennessee legislature puts hundreds of millions toward private-school vouchers

The second-term lawmaker said the legislature should form a board to oversee the program or request a study by a group such as the Tennessee Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations to allow legislators to see if they’re getting a “bang for their buck.”
State Rep. Mark White, chairman of the House Education Administration Committee, told the Lookout he needs to ask the department why it’s not asking for financial information on “universal” scholarships, because it is required by the bill.
The governor’s office said the law doesn’t require the state to collect information on previous enrollment, Chalkbeat reported.
White said he spoke with officials at one private school in Memphis who told him 80% of those receiving the funds were enrolled there already.
Yet he defended the program, saying it can benefit middle-class families whose children attend private schools in Memphis with tuition costs in the $15,000 range.
The Department of Education sent out a release in late May saying it received 38,000 applications for the voucher program, about half coming from families who qualify based on their income. 
The Education Department did not respond to questions from the Lookout about the program. Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds has not taken questions from the media in more than a year but said in the May release that demand is strong for “universal school choice.”
“All students deserve the ability to access a learning environment that best fits their unique needs,” Reynolds said in the release.
Besides the cost of the vouchers, this year’s bill contained a provision requiring local school boards to approve one-time $2,000 bonuses for teachers at a total cost of $198 million. The state is spending another $2.6 million to hire 11 people to oversee the program and $625,000 to contract with Student First Technologies to handle the online financial portion of the program.

The reasons for this cannot be laid out in a black and white, causal approach. 
We do know that technology, such as social media, has had an effect, while a reliance on media content over real-world experience also contributes. Regardless, the danger is still there.

Modern humans no longer have the same dangers as our nomadic ancestors, but that privilege has allowed us to take those instincts and manufacture crises or issues across tribes that result in a team vs. team dialectic, complete with merchandise, uniforms, winners, and losers. 
We’ve ‘gamified’ our society and it is to our detriment. We actively participate in ritual tribalism but the stakes, in our myopic view, are not severe. It’s a game.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Michigan, we understand tribalism all too well. As a person of a certain age that was told he was to be a Detroit Lions fan in the mid-1970s, I understand the process. Through the geographical circumstances of my birth, I championed a team that, by all accounts, had no right to be championed. I made excuses for their failures, celebrated their very few victories (until recent years, of course), but I never wavered. My allegiance was rewarded with being a part of a group of long-suffering people that I could identify with. 
Our devotion to the Lions, again for no other reason than where we lived, bonded us in a noble cause. We showed our allegiance by wearing the gear and flying the flags. And when other teams of people dared speak ill of the beloved Lions there could be vitriolic arguments. That is a process we are all familiar with, but the misapplication of that process into our political discourse is troubling.
Take, for example, Ted Nugent’s recent visit to the Michigan Legislature. As an avid outdoorsman and aging rocker, Nugent’s presence in front of that body was not to testify, but to chastise the members and call for wildlife conservation efforts to be further deregulated. He was asked to attend and address the lawmakers by a delegation of Republicans, not to affect policy change or bring real-world constituency issues to light, but as an armed celebrity endorsement.

From our national political fray down to local politics, these kinds of stunts are emblematic of the ‘gamification’ problem we face. Reality show presidents, newscaster cabinets, and celebrity guest stars in Lansing further the tribalistic approach and, much like trotting out a Hall of Fame quarterback from the past in order to drive ticket sales, the Nugent stunt is only a recent example.
Maybe the real culprit is Pac-Man or Zelda. As the Silent Generation and the older Boomers phase out, the generations born and bred on video games are in the majority, thus presenting anything as a winnable or losable achievement is attractive, prompting those same generations to choose sides and “play” their game. 
The gamification of our politics and our social norms isn’t new, just see earlier, historical, attempts at an ‘us vs. them’ approach to nationalism, but the current atmosphere is dangerous. 
Painting the other team as a faceless group of NPCs (non-player characters in video games, who are usually expendable and a necessary conquest for winning) further entrenches us into our tribal teams. 
The recent briefing held by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Detroit painted a crisis at Michigan’s northern border with Canada, wherein border crossers intent on harming God-fearing and innocent Michigan citizens must be stopped at all costs.

More examples can be found in the cheering and celebration of a sovereign nation bombing another sovereign nation. Just like a game of Risk, there aren’t real human beings maimed or killed, only those other players who are only as real as a voice in a headset when playing Call of Duty.
The above examples are, at their core, benign ones. Outside of mental disease or defect, the average person does not allow the winning and losing gamification of their fandom to result in violence. But what happens when the tribe raises the stakes? What happens when it changes from a sports team and to a president or prime minister? 
The gear and the flags remain the same, so the merchandise feels very game-like, but when your team believes that their very existence is at stake and the opposing team is just a character in the drama, then we have become monstrous. This has allowed us to openly celebrate the murder of fellow human beings and the destruction of homelands. Worse yet, by viewing our adversaries as nothing more than a ‘final boss’ it is so, so easy to actively pursue their defeat by any means necessary.

NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.

Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.
So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.
Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Sheyla Muñoz Garcia came to the United States from Mexico 15 years ago. All five of her children are U.S. citizens. On Friday, she became a citizen, too.
Muñoz Garcia was one of 40 new U.S. citizens who took the oath of allegiance at the William L. Guy Federal Courthouse in Bismarck to complete the final step of their naturalization process.
She said she decided to become a citizen this year to ensure that her permanent residency status could never be revoked.
“I had my green card and I was just trying to make sure my status is here, you know, because all my kids are Americans,” Muñoz Garcia said. 
She said she previously lived in Oklahoma, but decided to raise her family in North Dakota because she felt safe in the Peace Garden State.
“The kids really enjoy the outside at the farm and everything,” she said. Muñoz Garcia just gave birth to her youngest daughter 10 weeks ago and she was overjoyed to have her whole family in the courtroom to see their mother join them as citizens.

The kids are too young to understand the impact of watching her become a citizen, she said, but one of her daughters cried and pleaded with her recently, “I don’t want you to stop being Mexican.”
“I was like, ‘It’s not like that, it doesn’t go away, it’s in our blood. But we have to share great memories with the American culture, too,’” Muñoz Garcia said.
She also celebrated her 28th birthday on Friday, which she said made the naturalization ceremony a “great gift.”
Another new citizen, Jayla Crouse, is from the Philippines and has lived in the United States for seven years. She said she decided to become a citizen because her mother became one last year and she wanted to practice the same rights.
“The United States gave me a lot of opportunities here,” Crouse said. She said she’s studying to become a surgical technician at Bismarck State College and hopes to complete her coursework next year.
Olufemi Akinstan, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services representative from the Minneapolis field office, was on hand for the ceremony and ensured each new citizen had all of their naturalization paperwork before they left the building.
“It’s a joyful day for us and for the applicants,” Akinstan said.
Many of the new citizens have lived in the U.S for at least five years, he said. 
U.S. Chief Judge Peter Welte, who presided over the ceremony, told the new citizens to exercise the new rights granted to them by their citizenship, including the right to free speech, religion, assembly and the right to vote.

“These are rights that you have now,” Welte said. “And it was clear that the founders of this great land, of America, they considered that civic engagement at all levels was going to be vital to the success of this government.”
He said the group of new U.S. citizens came from countries such as Brazil, Canada, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Liberia, Mexico, Philippines, Rwanda, Uganda, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
Ceremonies earlier this week in Fargo were expected to include about 200 new citizens from 51 countries, according to the U.S. District Court.
Welte gave the citizens a brief history of the United States’ conflicts, including the Civil War and its journey of freedom and liberty since its inception. He closed his remarks with a question: How does this story end?
“It’s up to you,” he said. “Because you are now, we the people … and I urge you to make this a story that ends well.”

(Courtesy of Immunize Colorado)Many Colorado lawmakers and medical experts were already concerned about how the Trump administration could shake up vaccine recommendations and access in the state. Then Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, dismissed all 17 experts on the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, replacing them with eight new members, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.
But months before the changes at ACIP, state lawmakers approved a bill meant to insulate Colorado from vaccine policies that are inconsistent with scientific evidence. House Bill 25-1027 allows the state Board of Health to go beyond exclusively following ACIP for school vaccine requirements and consider recommendations from doctors’ groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians. It was signed into law in April.
State Sen. Lindsey Daugherty, an Arvada Democrat, was one of the bill’s sponsors. She said the provision that gives the state Board of Health more flexibility came from “discussions of what could be the worst thing that could happen (with ACIP), and how do we protect Colorado, future-looking?”
“Unfortunately, we’ve had to play on the defensive a lot in Colorado, and that’s something we take really seriously, because now, at least in Colorado, folks can look to science-based recommendations for vaccines for kids, instead of the politically-stacked ACIP,” Daugherty said.

The federal advisory committee, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is now chaired by Martin Kulldorff, a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who was fired in 2024 after declining the COVID-19 vaccine.
The committee met for the first time with its new members on Wednesday and Thursday, and voted to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines. The committee also announced it will reexamine current recommendations around childhood vaccination schedules and hepatitis B immunizations.
“Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee, issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro- or anti-vaccine box,” Kulldorff said during the commission meeting. “Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry, and it further feeds the flame of vaccine hesitancy. To thoroughly scrutinize and assure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.”










I’m glad that Colorado took these proactive steps to safeguard evidence-based vaccine recommendations.


– David Higgins, doctor at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus


But many other doctors have raised concerns. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said that, ideally, states would not need to have separate vaccine recommendations. He added that with “the dismantling of ACIP,” the Colorado law is necessary.
“I’m glad that Colorado took these proactive steps to safeguard evidence-based vaccine recommendations,” Higgins said. 
Maintaining trust in vaccines
When parents of his patients raise concerns about the safety or effectiveness of vaccines, Higgins listens to them without judgment. He clears up misconceptions, answers questions and communicates the science behind vaccines.
“We as pediatricians welcome parents’ questions and are ready to listen and try to understand and address parents’ concerns about vaccines,” Higgins said. “Vaccine hesitancy is not new.”
What is new, though, is the rapid spread of vaccine misinformation on social media, and an erosion of trust in ACIP, Higgins added.
“With the CDC and ACIP bypassing normal processes that are in place to ensure recommendations are made with scientific integrity, transparency and thoroughness, trust is going to be degraded,” Higgins said. “It’s going to lower trust in those institutions and that will trickle down to less confident recommendations and lower trust from parents.”
Higgins is on the board of Immunize Colorado, a nonprofit that focuses on vaccine education. The organization hosts vaccine information sessions at clinics and local events. 
“We are constantly doing vaccine education, and we’re not a direct vaccine provider, but we educate the community,” said Susan Lontine, Immunize Colorado’s executive director.

Vaccine access protection
Recommendations made by ACIP can directly impact which vaccines insurance companies are obligated to cover. With that in mind, Colorado lawmakers in April passed Senate Bill 25-196, another preventive care-related law.
The law empowers the state insurance commissioner to maintain the coverage of state-regulated preventive measures, including vaccines, even if ACIP recommendations change. 
State Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat, was one of the sponsors of that law, and of HB-1027. Mullica, an emergency room nurse, said it’s crucial that Coloradans get accurate information about vaccines and have affordable access to them.
“Americans are getting mixed signals and that’s really terrifying, because politics should not be in public health,” Mullica said. “We should rely on science.”
Amid significant vaccine misinformation, Kim Warner, an obstetrician and the president of the Colorado Medical Society, said one-on-one conversations between doctors and patients remain key.
“We can come out with recommendations all day long,” Warner said. “But I think sitting in the exam room and talking to patients about what vaccines are and aren’t, and what they do and what they don’t do, and answering their specific questions is one of the strongest things that we can do for patients.”

In a press release, the advocacy group Citizen Action of Wisconsin said “their flag reading the word ‘HUMAN’ in pride colors and its mount was ripped out of the side of the home and torn off of its flagpole.” 
“The flagpole had been bent, and the mounting bracket irreparably damaged,” Roe said at a press conference Thursday evening. “While we are grateful that no further property damage occurred, this incident reminds us that safety and dignity are still privileges not equally shared by all. This wasn’t just vandalism. This was a message.”
A local organizer told the Examiner that isn’t an isolated incident in the area, and speakers at the press conference talked about the impact of Pride flags on LGBTQ people. During the press conference, a new Pride flag went up at Roe and Frantz’s home.
“So today, on the 10-year anniversary of the federal legalization of same-sex marriage, we raise a new flag,” Roe said. “Not just in defiance, but in honor of all of those who have suffered because of hate, here in our community and everywhere that hate still exists.”
Police deemed what happened to Roe and Frantz a targeted attack, according to Citizen Action. 
Reiko Ramos, statewide anti-violence program director for the group Diverse & Resilient, which has a program that serves LGBTQ survivors of violence, shared a story at the press conference about a youth seeking the help of someone flying a Pride flag outside his home. 
“Complete strangers, they had never met,” Ramos said. “But they knew that his home was a safe place, that they could knock on their door. They were fleeing from their family, because they were experiencing domestic violence as a result of their identity… This youth actually knocked on the door and said, ‘I don’t know you, but I think you might be someone that I can ask for help.’” 
“And that is how this young person got connected to our services,” Ramos said. 
Mary Bogen, chairperson of the advocacy group Hate Free Outagamie (HFO), went to the press conference at Roe and Frantz’s home. She said she lives down the street.
“There’s a lot of people within this area that have had their Pride flags ripped down or had their houses vandalized for displaying pride flags,” Bogen said.
Bogen said that in some cases, she’s heard from people at Hate Free Outagamie events that they know who is responsible for stealing their Pride flag but don’t feel comfortable reporting it to the police. 
Bogen told the Examiner that  the LGBTQ+ community in Appleton is strong and thriving but that their resilience shouldn’t be necessary to walk down the street. 
“We often face open hostility, whether at a recent vigil we held for victims of the Pulse shooting or simply leaving a Pride event,” Bogen said. “People scream slurs from cars, film us for harassment, and sneer as if bigotry is a civic pastime. And too often, it’s done under the banner of a certain kind of patriotism. This isn’t just incidents, it’s a pattern. We refuse to accept it as normal. Our community deserves safety, respect, and the freedom to exist without fear. That’s why Hate Free Outagamie is working to establish a Trans Sanctuary in Outagamie County.”
In September 2023, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors voted to become a sanctuary for transgender and non-binary people, and Dane County made a similar decision earlier that year, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
Under the Milwaukee resolution, if the state of Wisconsin passes a law “that imposes criminal or civil punishments, fines, or professional sanctions on any person or organization that seeks, provides, receives or helps someone to receive gender-affirming care such as puberty blockers, hormones, or surgery, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors urges the Milwaukee County Sheriff to make enforcement their lowest priority.”
Vered Meltzer, a local alder and reportedly the first openly transgender individual to hold elected office in Wisconsin, said there is “still so much work to be done in Appleton to make things better, but we are the ones who build the world into the community that we want it to be.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal grant cuts to research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center could include funding for programs meant to improve diversity in medical research faculty and research participants, according to data released by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center — a medical system giant in the southeast that handles more than 3.5 million patient visits annually — expects to lay off 650 employees due to grant and funding cuts made by the Trump Administration, the organization announced in a statement on June 20. Staffing cuts will be focused in research, administrative and support roles.
The health care system plans to reduce its operating costs by $300 million “in response to the impact of budgetary actions in Washington, D.C. related to government-sponsored research and patient care,” VUMC stated.
VUMC declined to provide more specific information on the research projects and grants impacted by federal cuts, but DOGE’s database indicates funding retractions for at least two multi-year VUMC initiatives receiving support from the National Institutes of Health.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center to lay off up to 650 after Trump administration grant cuts

The Vanderbilt Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (Vanderbilt FIRST) program aims to recruit more women and people of minority racial or ethnic groups to the faculty. 
“Scientific workforce diversity has been a longstanding challenge, and lack of progress negatively impacts innovation, scientific discovery, and ultimately public health,” the program’s description on federal grant database USASpending.gov states.
NIH allocated nearly $6 million toward the program, but the site shows about $1.4 million had been paid before the grant was scrapped, totaling an estimated $4.6 million loss for VUMC.
Another program aimed to bolster engagement for participants in research, particularly for participants of diverse backgrounds. 
“Our nationwide community of participants and researchers is partnering together to ensure that everyone is included in research,” the “All of Us” research program’s page on the NIH website states. “The information our participants generously share is fueling thousands of studies to better understand health and disease and enable more tailored and equitable approaches to care.”
Roughly $2.8 million was obligated for the latest “All of Us” initiative, and USASpending.gov shows about $2 million has been funnelled by the government, adding up to an $800,000 loss for VUMC.
While the DOGE database indicates the types of programs targeted for funding cuts by the Trump Administration, it does not present a complete picture of all funding cuts to an organization. The database may not be regularly updated to reflect the reinstatement of funds. Its data is also imperfect. A previous analysis by Tennessee Lookout found that while DOGE listed only one terminated grant worth $305,000 for Middle Tennessee State University, that grant was really one of several canceled grants with federal funding roots at the university. 
DOGE’s records show another unidentified grant for VUMC initially worth $27.4 million was terminated with $4.4 million left unpaid.
The staying power of NIH grant cuts is unclear. A federal judge ruled in a multi-state court case earlier this month that the Trump Administration must reinstate some grants after declaring their termination was “void and illegal.” The ruling’s order to restore grant funding applied only to grants mentioned in that lawsuit and another similar suit filed by the American Public Health Association.
VUMC is not listed as a party in either lawsuit.

(Getty Images)Fertility treatment advocates have expressed concerns about a new Arkansas law they say is meant to cast doubt on the effectiveness of assisted reproductive technology, even though the law does not penalize or prohibit such treatments.
Act 859 of 2025, the Reproductive Empowerment and Support Through Optimal Restoration (RESTORE) Act, is “groundbreaking legislation that champions reproductive healthcare for women in Arkansas by prioritizing restorative reproductive medicine,” the conservative group Heritage Action for America said in an April news release.
The law defines “restorative reproductive medicine” as “a scientific approach… that seeks to cooperate with or restore the normal physiology and anatomy of the human reproductive system without the use of methods that are inherently suppressive, circumventive or destructive to natural human functions.”
Restorative reproductive medicine includes ultrasounds, blood tests, hormone measurements, exploratory surgeries, “natural procreative technology” and “fertility awareness-based methods,” among other things, according to Act 859.
The law goes into effect in August and requires Arkansas insurance companies to cover restorative reproductive medicine. This includes the Medicaid expansion program, Elizabeth Pitman, director of the Division of Medical Services for Arkansas Medicaid, told the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee in March.
  Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs (Arkansas Secretary of State)
The RESTORE Act’s sponsor, Heber Springs Republican Rep. Alyssa Brown, said at the same committee meeting that restorative reproductive medicine is not only more affordable than assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) but also is “less abrasive on the body and has higher success rates.”
“I want to be clear: This doesn’t limit anyone’s ability to access IVF,” said Brown, who did not respond to the Advocate’s requests for comment.
Brown’s statement was true, but Act 859 is still cause for concern, said Dr. Dean Moutos, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Little Rock’s Arkansas Fertility and Gynecology Associates. The clinic’s website includes a header that warns prospective patients against restorative reproductive medicine, saying it’s “not a medically proven alternative to IVF.”
“If you read between the lines, [Act 859] is a backhanded attack on assisted reproductive technology in my view, not because of what they say, but because of what they clearly omit” by not including proven methods such as IVF in discussions of fertility treatments, Moutos said in an interview.

He disputed the claim that assisted reproductive technologies are “suppressive” as supporters of restorative reproductive medicine claim.
“When they talk about natural procreation, restoring nature and all this other stuff, that’s great, but the patients I’ve seen have already tried that and it hasn’t worked,” Moutos said.
Similarly, the IVF advocacy group Resolve: The National Infertility Association is concerned that the rhetoric surrounding restorative reproductive medicine frames it as a necessary “first step before IVF,” and this could “take some of the autonomy from the patient,” Resolve Director of Government Affairs Alise Powell said in an interview.
“It’s concerning that folks are trying to deprioritize something that is evidence-based in favor of something that… folks are already doing in order to prepare themselves on their fertility journey,” Powell said.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which advocates for physicians that practice reproductive health care and fertility treatments, said restorative reproductive medicine “is not medical practice but ideology.”
“Its proponents create a false narrative that standard fertility care skips proper diagnosis or healing, when in fact, it is based on precisely those principles,” the organization stated.
Moutos said he was not surprised that assisted reproductive technology has come under conservative scrutiny in the three years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left abortion access up to the states. Arkansas has one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion bans, with a narrow exception to save the life of the pregnant individual.
IVF providers in Alabama, which also has one of the most restrictive abortion bans, temporarily halted operations in response to a February 2024 state Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children and if destroyed, a wrongful death lawsuit could be filed. State lawmakers later passed legislation providing criminal and civil protections for IVF clinics.
Republican President Donald Trump, who called himself the “father of IVF” on the campaign trail last year, issued an executive order earlier this year directing policy advisers to create a report on how to make in vitro fertilization more accessible for Americans.

What top IVF advocates want from the White House fertility care plan


 ‘Natural’ methods

Restorative reproductive medicine is “not mainstream medicine,” which merits the warning against it on the Arkansas Fertility and Gynecology website, Moutos said, but none of his patients have asked him about it because it lacks “traction with the general public.”
In addition to the insurance coverage requirement for restorative reproductive medicine, Act 859 also prohibits state-funded entities from penalizing a medical professional who declines to participate in fertility treatments due to “sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.”
Some branches of conservative Christian ideology disagree with assisted reproductive technology and condone only “natural” methods of conception.
Act 859 frequently mentions “fertility awareness-based methods,” such as tracking body temperature and hormone production during the menstrual cycle, as methods of assessing fertility without medical intervention. The law specifically cites the Billings Ovulation Method of fertility tracking, endorsed by the Catholic Church, which opposes artificial contraception. The law also cites the Creighton Model FertilityCare System, marketed as a “standardized modification” of the Billings method.
Moutos said these methods are not part of standard fertility treatment practices because they are “too unreliable” and have “a pretty high failure rate.”
The RESTORE Act requires the use of fertility awareness-based methods in programs funded by federal Title X family planning grant funds, which the Trump administration has attempted to withhold.

An earlier version of the RESTORE Act, which Brown amended in March, would have required the Department of Health to “implement reporting requirements for the standard of care for the diagnosis of infertility,” including “referrals to restorative reproductive medicine that are given before referrals for or use of assisted reproductive technology.”
Rep. Denise Ennett, D-Little Rock, said at the March committee meeting that she had issues with this portion of the bill because it could lead to privacy violations and discrimination via “the surveillance of tracking women’s personal health data.”
Brown told Ennett the intent of the deleted language was to “figure out how to update these services to better serve women who want to conceive.”
 Other legislation

A 2023 bill sponsored by Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, would have charged abortion recipients with homicide and repealed sections of Arkansas law that protect IVF providers from prosecution if an embryo is damaged or discarded. The bill was never heard in committee.
Two other bills related to fertility treatments that Brown sponsored during the 2025 legislative session caught Moutos’ attention, he said, but neither made it out of committee.
The proposed Fertility Clinic Licensure Act would have created a special license for medical clinics that practice IVF in addition to their existing medical licenses.
The proposed Assisted Reproductive Technology Reporting Act would have required fertility clinics to annually report to the state Department of Health how many embryos they fertilize and the outcomes of each one, ranging from discarding to full-term pregnancies.
Fertility clinics are already required to report this data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Moutos said.
Rep. Dolly Henley, R-Washington, said she was strongly opposed to the Assisted Reproductive Technology Reporting Act. She voted against the RESTORE Act in the House Public Health committee in March because she mistakenly thought it was the other bill. Henley later realized her mistake and voted for the RESTORE Act when it passed the full House, she said in an interview.
Arkansas health care workers support national call to protect IVF

The law passed the House with the support of three Democrats — Reps. Glenn Barnes of Pine Bluff, and Joy Springer and Fred Allen of Little Rock — and 76 Republicans. It passed the Senate along party lines with all six Democrats voting against it.
Republican U.S. senators introduced the RESTORE Act on the federal level in May after the same bill did not advance in Congress last year. Conversely, Senate Democrats introduced legislation this year and last year to protect access to IVF.
A Democrat-sponsored bill to require Arkansas’ State and Public School Life and Health Insurance Program to cover IVF did not advance in the Legislature this year.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)About 85,000 acres of backcountry in Tennessee could be opened for road construction, mining and logging under a Trump administration plan to remove protections from the most remote and untouched portions of U.S. national forests.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins last week announced the plan to rescind the “roadless rule,” which has preserved 59 million acres of public forests and grasslands across the nation since the Clinton administration adopted it in 2001, following decades of advocacy by conservation groups.
Rollins said the move is necessary to allow for wildfire management, create opportunities for the timber industry and reflects President Donald Trump’s mandate to ax “overcomplicated, burdensome barriers that hamper American business and innovation.”
Environmental groups say eliminating the rule puts wildlife, clean water, recreation and old-growth forests “on the chopping block” and clears the way for mining, oil and gas development and timber harvesting.
The announcement “shows this administration is completely out of touch with what Americans value in our public lands,” said Sam Evans, who leads the Southern Environmental Law Center’s National Forests and Parks Program. 
The roadless rule contains specific exceptions for wildfire prevention and suppression, and for removal of non-native species.
“Saying this is about wildfire protection is not even a good fig leaf,” he said.

Of Tennessee’s 698,000 acres of national forested lands, 85,000 have protections under the current roadless rule. 
They include portions of Land Between the Lakes in northern Tennessee and pockets within the Cherokee National Forest that stretches for 660,000 acres across the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Beaver Dam Creek, Slide Hollow, Elk Creek, Bald Mountains, Horse Cove, Sycamore Creek are among the popular backcountry areas currently protected by the roadless rule.
U.S. Department of Agriculture officials did not respond to questions about the proposed rule but noted on its web site that “more information will be released as the rescission process gets underway.”
The process to eliminate a federal rule requires preparation of environmental analyses, compliance with the Endangered Species Act, tribal consultation and coordination with affected states in a public rule-making process, it said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-30 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘No school like Freedom School’: Jackson students attend revived summer program,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/30/no-school-like-freedom-school-jackson-students-attend-revived-summer-program/,"Freedom Schools have especially deep roots in Mississippi, started as part of the 1964 Freedom Summer project.","A cacophony of children’s voices, punctuated by stomps and claps, echoed in the Cardozo Middle School gymnasium in West Jackson.
“Hold on, wait a minute, let me put some freedom in it!” about 50 kids chanted, while their parents held up their phones to record the moment. 
The Friday-morning event commemorated the end of Freedom School this summer — a free weeks-long program that promotes reading and leadership skills. The Children’s Defense Fund runs the program in 26 states every year, with more than 11,000 student participants, but Freedom Schools have especially deep roots in Mississippi.
As part of the 1964 Freedom Summer civil rights project, the first Freedom Schools aimed at fostering political and community engagement were founded in Mississippi. Three decades later, the Children’s Defense Fund revived the concept, opening their first schools in 1995. 
What exists now at Jackson Public Schools, the only district in Mississippi that has partnered with CDF since 2022 to operate Freedom Schools at three of their sites, is a “reimagined” version of what existed the summer of 1964. 
“It’s so important, when you think about what the teachers were able to accomplish that one summer,” said Kristal Moore Clemons, national director of the Freedom Schools program. “To have this rebirth and have children in 2025 learn about civil rights and the importance of being change agents and leaders, it’s just remarkable.”
For five days a week this past month, from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m., the students were led through a literacy curriculum, learned about history and practiced leadership skills. They read one book a week, and at the end of the program, they got to take a book home to build their own personal library. 
It doesn’t matter what reading level the students are at when they arrive — CDF trains college-age “servant leader interns” to meet the kids where they are and bolster their skills. 
Janai Virgil, an upcoming 4th grader at McWillie Elementary School, has been attending the summer program for two years now. Her mother, Jamila, spent a lot of time researching Freedom Schools to decide whether or not she wanted her daughter to attend. The focus on civic engagement made up her mind. 
“The students improve their reading skills over the summer, but they also learn about our history and their role in society,” she said. “This program helps them think about how they fit into the greater picture and how they can help not only themselves but their families and their local community, state and country, and that when we work together collectively we can achieve great things.”
Every June afternoon Jamila picked Janai up from Freedom School, the 9-year-old could barely contain her excitement telling her mother everything she’d learned, all the books she’d read and the rich conversations she’d had. 
“I can tell it’s affecting her and her desire to improve her community,” Jamila said. 
Additionally, Clemons said the program is greatly successful at preventing the dreaded “summer slide” — the loss of academic knowledge over summer vacation. And in Jackson, retaining reading skills is more important than ever.
The state’s reading gains have garnered national attention, but just over half of third-graders at Jackson Public Schools are reading on grade level. 
JPS board member Jeanne Middleton-Hairston was one of the proud adults in the crowd on Friday. As she watched on, the significance of the program resonated with her. 
Middleton-Hairston grew up in west Jackson. Her grandmother lived across the street from civil rights workers who came down the summer of 1964, and Medgar Evers’ office was two blocks away from her childhood home. 
“The history of Freedom Schools is part of the soil here,” she said. “It’s a safe place for them to come and know how brilliant and able they are and how working together makes everything better for everyone. There ain’t no school like Freedom School.”
So when the students started singing, Middleton-Hairston couldn’t help but get up and dance.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/27142216/IMG_5953.jpg,,,2025-06-30 07:07:25.140424

(West Virginia State Archives photo)“The U.S. tax system lacks this level of progressivity. The influence wielded by wealthy individuals and corporations over tax policy often leads to systems that favour the upper class, further exacerbating income inequality and placing a greater burden on the middle and lower classes.”- Dr. Farh Naz (March 2025)
I am a capitalist. I retired as a senior vice president with a national health care corporation. One of my clients was the Charleston Area Medical Center. 
But I know Dr. Naz is correct. Most Americans know little of our own history, and do not realize how wealthy special interests have historically controlled our lives. Here is one West Virginia example.
My best friend was a coal miner on the West Virginia/Pennsylvania border. But when asked, he knew nothing about the 1921 Blair Mountain uprising. I doubt many West Virginians do, especially younger ones. 
Given the rightward political turn of West Virginians over the past few decades, it’s important that they know this anti-capitalist aspect of their history. A good place to start is a West Virginia Archives and History publication named “The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920-1921” by Clayton D. Laurie.
A century ago, coal mine owners treated their underpaid and mistreated miners as virtual indentured servants. West Virginia’s politicians were in the pockets of mine operators, as were local officials. They did nothing to alleviate the suffering of commoners. The response of the powerless, exploited miners was to form unions, culminating in the 1890 formation of the United Mine Workers. 
Mine owners viciously opposed unionization, using “eviction, termination, blacklisting, yellow dog contracts, court injunctions, coercion and intimidation.” Still, unions were able to obtain limited power. By 1920, the UMW had grown to 50,000 members. 
This situation came to a violent head in what was known as the “Matewan Massacre.” The Matewan Massacre was a shootout between locals (including the sheriff), and outside private mercenaries (so called “detectives”) paid by the mine owners. Many people died, including Matewan’s mayor. 
Federal troops were brought in at the request of the governor (as opposed to Trump’s recent unilateral nationalization of the California National Guard against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom). They quashed the miners wanting unionization and imposed martial law. 
The situation worsened over time, eventually resulting in the Battle of Blair Mountain. At Blair Mountain, 7,000 poorly armed miners wanting to unionize Logan County mines stood up to an army consisting of private mercenaries, the West Virginia National Guard, and Federal troops.
The miners were outgunned. After a five-day pitched battle, they lost, leading to a deterioration of the union. The UMW did not get back to its prior strength until the New Deal in 1933. 
During my decades in corporate America, I learned that corporations, like the West Virginia mine owners, have only one goal — profit. And the aim of corporate executives is to maximize their power, leading to the creation of personal wealth. These objectives lead to efficient operations in most cases (although not always). However, they increasingly lead to worker exploitation, as was historically true in West Virginia’s mines. 
Per a Pew Research report, our nation has tremendous inequities versus G-7 nations. This wealth gap is getting larger, doubling from 1989 to 2016. But there is a failure by the GOP base, which supported tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations in 2017, to understand why. And that base still supports Trump’s extending these cuts now via his “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The average West Virginian would be better off with a blend of capitalism infused with socialism, like in Europe. We have some welfare programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. Of course, no one acknowledges them as socialistic, which they are. 
They have become the third rail of American politics. And are with us for good, as Trump knows. But America must do more, including lowering the age for Medicare benefits, eliminating the 20% co-pay and eventually having Medicare for all Americans which would reduce current program waste and overhead. 
Regarding revenue generation, America can also do much more. For example, taxing all income for Social Security, rather than cutting off at $176,000 in 2025. And raising taxes on the rich and corporations, rather than extending Trump’s cuts. All it takes is the political will.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Speaking before the Kentucky Public Service Commission, Big Rivers Electric Corp. CEO Don Gulley recently praised the economic impact of the Nucor steel mill that began operating in late 2022 near the Meade County seat of Brandenburg. 
The Nucor Corp. says it employs more than 400 people to make steel plates for heavy equipment and infrastructure, including foundations for off-shore wind towers. Local elected officials in Meade County along with Gov. Andy Beshear have also hailed the project. 
“This was a massive effort to locate a large manufacturing company in Kentucky that would bring jobs, would bring secondary impact, would bring tax benefits and would be just generally good for the state,” Gulley said during a June 4 hearing. 
Now, much to Big Rivers’ dismay, an aspect of that deal is under scrutiny by the state’s utility regulator.
Big Rivers granted Nucor a significant discount on its large electricity bill in the form of millions of dollars of fuel costs that the steel mill didn’t have to pay. Those electricity costs, estimated by Gulley to be about $11 million a year, were instead passed on to Big Rivers’ approximately 121,000 ratepayers through 2031, under a contract between the utility and the company. The vast majority of Big Rivers’ ratepayers are residences and businesses. 
It’s unclear why a discount that’s been in place for several years has drawn the attention of the Public Service Commission (PSC) in recent months, but the scrutiny has spurred Big Rivers’ leaders and the three electricity distribution cooperatives that the utility supplies to warn the PSC against trying to change the contract.

(gray) and Meade County Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. (blue). The utility has its headquarters in Owensboro. (Source: Big Rivers Electric Corp.)
Gulley used the term “nuclear option” to describe the possibility that the PSC would order Big Rivers to refund to ratepayers the millions of dollars in fuel costs they covered for the steel mill.
Gulley said such a decision could force the nonprofit utility to seek an emergency rate increase  and impact the utility’s ability to meet its loan obligations. 
He said an emergency rate case “would be highly detrimental” and could have a significant “negative impact” on the utility’s credit rating and future costs to take out loans. 
It’s also not clear if ratepayers knew about the arrangement between Big Rivers and Nucor that had them covering a significant portion of the steel mill’s electricity costs. In a response to questions from the Lantern including if ratepayers were aware of the arrangement, a Big Rivers spokesperson said the utility couldn’t share much about the ongoing case. 
“We are very supportive of the unique Nucor development, which has provided numerous benefits to Big Rivers and its Member-Owners, as well as to the region and state,” Gulley said in a statement provided through the spokesperson. 
Questions over fuel costs
The contract between Big Rivers and the Nucor steel mill in Brandenburg became a point of contention in recent months as the commission reviewed Big Rivers’ fuel adjustment clause, a provision that allows utilities to automatically pass through to ratepayers the changing costs of fuel, typically coal or natural gas in Kentucky.
The PSC regularly reviews utilities’ use of the fuel adjustment clause to make sure only reasonable costs are being passed on to ratepayers. The PSC can order a refund to ratepayers if it determines a utility has overcharged for fuel.
Big Rivers’ contract with Nucor exempted the industrial operation from paying its share of the variable fuel costs through the fuel adjustment clause.Those fuel adjustment clause costs were collected from other ratepayers instead, raising their fuel costs and utility bills.
Gulley, along with leaders of electricity distribution cooperatives Jackson Purchase Energy Cooperative, Meade County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation and Kenergy Corp., argued to regulators the higher fuel charges for other ratepayers were well worth it because of the economic benefits that the Nucor steel mill in Brandenburg had provided. 
The utility in a filing says the PSC approved the contract  including what the utility says are provisions that the commission is now questioning — with Nucor in 2020 — even if the utility received no PSC guidance or directive specifically allowing it to exempt Nucor from paying for variable fuel costs.
  Don Gulley, Big Rivers Electric Corp. CEO and president, urged the Public Service Commission not to require the utility to credit ratepayers for Nucor’s past fuel costs. (Screenshot/YouTube)
The utility argued the provisions in the contract were “necessary” to land Nucor in Meade County. 
“Undoubtedly, it has been a win,” Gulley said. “I’m not sure it was everything that was promised, but I also recognize that Nucor is an international company and operates on a global basis.” 
This question of ratepayers covering the cost of a large industrial customer’s discount arises at a time when power-intensive data centers are looking to negotiate electricity deals with utilities. 
“If utilities are going to be negotiating one-off special contracts with new large (electricity) loads, it certainly has the possibility of things like this being missed and socialized over to the bills of all the other ratepayers in Kentucky,” said Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council. 
Gary, whose group intervenes in utility regulation cases before the PSC, wasn’t involved in the Big Rivers case focusing on Nucor’s contract but did review the filings in the case before the PSC. 
But in an interview with the Lantern, Gary questioned whether the economic development arguments justify requiring other ratepayers to bear Nucor’s variable fuel costs, though he declined to offer an opinion on whether the arrangement was appropriate.
He also said the arrangement between Nucor and Big Rivers could potentially violate PSC precedent that requires companies subject to economic development electricity agreements to cover variable costs. 
Nucor contract has helped stabilize Big Rivers’ finances
Big Rivers has asked the PSC, which traditionally speaks through its written orders, for a decision. The utility also has suggested options the PSC could take that would allow the utility to maintain its arrangement, including offering ratepayers a report on the costs of fuel costs for the Nucor steel mill. 
During the June 4 hearing, Gulley said having Nucor as a customer has strengthened the utility’s recently shaky financial position. Big Rivers had to raise rates after aluminum smelters stopped purchasing power from the utility. Consumer advocates have previously raised concerns about significant increases  in utility bills and electricity costs for Big Rivers’ ratepayers in the past 15 years. 
“I have worked to change the focus at Big Rivers to serve our members and to be member focused. I’ve made great progress in the last 18 months,” said Gulley, who was hired as the utility’s president and CEO in 2023. “This is a pivotal moment for us, and we’ll chart the course for the next three to five years.”

Green International Airport for another five years under a deal that keeps the Warwick hub as the team’s official airport.
And all it will cost the team is one dollar — along with a lot of courtesy advertising to boost the airport’s regional branding. 
That’s according to the agreement approved by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation this month which waives landing and parking fees for the team’s two jumbo jets at T.F. Green through July 2030. In exchange, the Patriots will continue to provide the Warwick airport with a series of promotional benefits including permission to use the team’s name and image in ads in every New England state, aside from Vermont.
The six-time Super Bowl champs must also provide T.F. Green signage along the endzone at each home game at Gillette Stadium, along with digital ads on the team’s website, mobile applications, and social media; and Patriot game radio spots.
T.F. Green has been the official airport of the Patriots since the two signed a similar deal in 2017.
“This agreement benefits both parties and allows us to advertise within our catchment area in a meaningful and cost-effective way that has helped us increase passenger volume,” Iftikhar Ahmad, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, said in a statement.
A Patriots spokesperson declined to comment on the renewed deal.
New ads are still in development by the Denver-based agency Karsh Hagan, according to Nikolas Persson, RIAC’s senior vice president of business development and information technology.
No firm numbers are listed in the new contract with the Patriots, aside from the estimated five million impressions that digital ads will likely provide the airport each football season. 
Charts provided to Rhode Island Current show airport officials waived nearly $527,000 worth of fees between 2020 and 2024 while the Patriots provided a little over $6.1 million worth of ads in that same period.
Whatever airport officials get out of the new deal, University of Rhode Island marketing professor Dan Sheinin sees the continued partnership with the Patriots as a way for T.F. Green to to set itself apart from regional competitors like Logan International Airport in Boston or Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.
“For Green, the component is to stay in the mental conversation,” he said. “I’m sure everybody knows it’s there — but if people don’t have any experience with the airport or haven’t been there for a long time, they probably don’t think about it.”
And there’s no bigger brand to boost that name recognition with than the National Football League.
“The NFL is one of the hottest culture and entertainment brands that exists,” Sheinin said. “Any brand or entity that’s affiliated with any aspect of the shield is going to get some sort of halo benefits from that — even if it’s a team that’s in the lower half of the league.”
It hasn’t been a good few years for the Patriots. The team is coming off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and has had two coaching changes. But the deal makers were apparently optimistic that the team can return to its winning ways, as the contract includes provisions for branding around postseason games.
“If the Patriots get back to being competitive, this kind of association will be even more valuable,” Sheinin said.

NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.











I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert



The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.











We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


–  – Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey



Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Getty Images)Our weekly newspaper — The Anderson News — is published on Thursdays. 
On Friday, June 20, I stopped at the Lawrenceburg Kroger to grab a copy of the paper, but the stack of issues was dated June 12, the week prior. I recalled being at our Walmart a few weeks earlier, on a Monday, and that The Anderson News from the previous week had still not been delivered. 
When I asked a busy clerk about this, she shrugged. “It comes when it comes.”
You might say I should get with the program and read my local newspaper online, but like many Kentuckians I live out a rural road and down a hill where the internet and even phone service can be spotty, so as long as The Anderson News is available in paper form, I choose paper. This is also how I track what little news is in our newspaper these days, and I am coming to the sad realization that we are witnessing the slow, suffocating, untimely death of our once-robust community newspaper.
There is a fairly famous essay titled “Drowning doesn’t look like drowning” by Mario Vittone that gets reprinted by a number of news outlets every summer. Vittone lists a handful of unexpected things to look for and stipulates that “Drowning is almost always a deceptively quiet event. The waving, splashing, and yelling that dramatic conditioning (television) prepares us to look for, is rarely seen in real life.”
Similarly, the death of local news can be deceptively quiet. No big boss in a three-piece suit comes to town, hands out pink slips, and shuts down a printing press with a loud hiss. 
Here in Anderson County, Kentucky, population 24,000, there still exists a newspaper; there is a pop-up-ad-heavy website that’s updated weekly; there are still paper-papers, albeit sometimes delivered late, in neat, familiar stacks near the front doors of Kroger, Walmart and the gas station where you can see what is above the fold; there are still obituaries and high school sports and a report that a county or city meeting occurred. 
But there is no context, historical or otherwise, no investigations to speak of, and no — how do I say this? — life.
As a freelancer, I regularly wrote commentary for The Anderson News from 2017-2020. Back then there was an office, an experienced and dedicated editor, a front desk clerk, and at least one reporter and/or sports reporter on staff. To say we had an engaging opinion page or letters the the editor page (sometimes two full pages) is an understatement. Our newspaper was our town square, so much so that I would often grab coffee and a paper at the Five Star gas station first thing on the morning the paper came out and drive to a friend’s office before 9 a.m. to banter about what was happening in town.
In May 2021, Paxton Media Group announced that it had purchased The Anderson News and dozens of other community newspapers. “We are very excited to add these newspapers into the PMG portfolio,” said Jamie Paxton, PMG president and CEO. “PMG believes strongly in the value of local newspapers and the vital role they play in the communities that they serve.”
Vital role? The Anderson News is an anemic shell of itself at, most weeks, eight pages. 
The opinion page and letters to the editor no longer exist, signaling lack of community input and engagement. 
Reports on city and county meetings are rote, reading more like meeting minutes than reportage or analysis. Investigations, in-depth interviews and follow up are non-existent.
There is a full page dedicated to religion, and politicians like state representative James Tipton, state senator Aaron Reed, and U.S. Rep. Andy Barr are often given half or almost-full pages to communicate their political agendas to the public.
Multiple datelines in our June 12 paper, for example, read BARDSTOWN, LOUISVILLE, LEXINGTON. In other words, not here.

It is often said that newspapers don’t make money, so what can we expect? What about capitalism? Here I will argue that newspapers, like the government, do not exist to make money. Newspapers and government agencies exist (or *should* exist) to serve the people. When newspapers and/or government entities are tasked to focus on profit profit profit, like a business with shareholders, citizens’ needs become collateral damage.
Case in point: Billionaire Elon Musk was tasked by the current president to rid government agencies of waste, fraud and abuse via his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But for all the hoopla, Reuters reports, ”DOGE is not a serious exercise,” said Jessica Riedl, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank that supports streamlining government. She estimates DOGE has only saved $5 billion to date, and believes it will end up costing more than it saves.”
On the newspaper side, what we have learned in Anderson County is that when your local newspaper is starved of the resources to report enough news to keep citizens informed in a timely manner, beware of what will fill the void. 
Enter the “Lawrenceburg Catch All.” 
According to their Facebook page, Lawrenceburg Catch All was created two years after Paxton Media Group purchased The Anderson News. There are three administrators, more than 9,000 members who can post anonymously if they choose to, and there appears to be no checking of sources or facts. During recent breaking news in which almost our entire city fire department resigned, citizens found what they wanted to know — true or not — in the Lawrenceburg Catch All and in Lexington TV news, not our newspaper.
Last week I asked locals to describe the Lawrenceburg Catch All in one word. This is what they told me: drama, embarrassing, breaking news, meanness, a soap opera, ugly, funny, trouble, misinformation, s**t, a train wreck. And yet they all still check this page as their news source because, as one man said, “Where else am I supposed to look?”
Drowning doesn’t look like drowning, and living in a news desert does not mean your newspaper was shuttered with fanfare like they do in the movies.
One day you find out that your newspaper has been purchased by a corporate consolidator like Paxton Media Group who claims to care about journalism and your community. 
Then you learn that your newspaper’s longtime editor has been replaced by a preacher-turned-editor who soon goes back to being a preacher. They tell you everything is fine because yet another editor, who is in a different county and in charge of multiple newspapers, is now the editor, and that your town has one reporter who lives somewhere else.
Months later, you are driving through town when you notice your newspaper’s office has been quietly closed and that “The Anderson News” sign you used to drive by every day, near the Dairy Queen, has been removed from the marquee. 
One day in the very near future, you, too, may live in a town where local news is just a private Facebook group moderated by people you don’t know and where group members who can post anonymously are the sources.
This is the definition of a news desert.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In 1996, women from both sides of the strife tearing apart Northern Ireland, then divided along ethno-nationalist lines, formed a political party to advocate for inclusion and human rights in upcoming peace talks. Only the top 10 vote-getting parties would be part of the talks. Though they organized only six weeks in advance of the election, the women’s party came in ninth out of 24. 
Their remarkable success was attributed to keeping their message simple: inclusion, human rights and equality. They also urged “transversal politics,” meaning members could keep their own identity and views on various issues while respecting those of others to advance their common goal of having a voice at the table. Their slogan was “Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs.” 
The No Kings movement could learn from those Irish women.
I consider myself part of the No Kings movement. I call it a movement because movements are collective efforts by a group of people to bring about or resist social or political change.
There were eight marches to protest the values and policies of the Trump Administration in my small state of Rhode Island on June 14, which just so happened to be Flag Day.
That day, tens of thousands of people showed up for marches in New York, New Jersey and Southern California. Estimates overall suggest millions of people participated in marches across the United States. Photos of the demonstrations show some marchers waved U.S. flags, but the flags of other nations appeared as well.
Consequently, the simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.
As a female academic teaching security studies in professional military education for 20-plus years, the importance of “reading the room” and consequently properly “selling your message” to the audience cannot be overstated. What will make them listen? What will shut them down? The same is true for the growing numbers of Trump supporters who are disappointed — and frightened by — the actions of an increasingly authoritarian regime. Latino voters who helped Trump retake the White House, for example, are falling away, as are low-information voters, rural voters, young adults and ethnic voters. But they will not be lured to a movement that often conveys mixed messages through its rhetoric and images. The message ought to be of a tolerant, diverse, united America. But that’s not always the case. 










The simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.


The Fourth of July is the perfect opportunity to do better.
Rather than showing up at rallies and parades with flags from other countries and symbols of political causes, No Kings supporters should show up with American flags. Diversity makes America great, and a sea of diverse individuals all waving the same flag shows a united front. All Americans are Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, and all Americans are Mexican on Cinco de Mayo. Now all Americans and those who want to live in an American democracy need to show their support for American democracy when trying to stop an autocracy. “Make America Great Again” Trumpians have usurped the America flag as their own but abandoned American values. The No Kings movement needs to embrace and retake the American flag as its own, as a symbol of American democracy and values. 
Further, rather than glorifying individuals who have been unjustly attacked after they exercised their constitutional rights to, for example, free speech — some of whom are themselves divisive for their political views — simply support the right to free speech, as well as freedoms like religion and assembly. Don’t give Trumpians the opportunity to distort the important message of the No Kings movement into one of a hyper-radicalized left where individuals can’t even get along with each other. For the movement to grow, it must attract diverse individuals who can tip the scales away from authoritarianism. It must give all individuals a safe and welcoming place to go.
And while many individuals are rightly afraid of their rights being abused by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or some other form of retribution, individuals can be identified with or without a mask if the government is determined to do so. Pictures of individuals who show up at rallies or parades wearing masks and waving flags from other countries quickly become headline news or click bait for right-wing media. That does not serve the movement well.
We are living in an era of normalized chaos, deliberately created to allow autocracy to take hold. The No Kings movement clearly shows there is opposition. Movements can learn from the success and failure of others. No Kings should take an organizational and marketing lesson from the women of Northern Ireland.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Kings-SLC_SH_02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-30 06:02:16.336995

US Senate launches debate on GOP mega-bill, but passage still not assured

Provider assessment rates and state-directed payment programs are at risk — two funding mechanisms that are critical to hospital operation in Virginia and that determine how hospitals chip into the state’s expanded Medicaid coverage. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association estimated each program could take a $2 billion hit, if the proposal is fully implemented. 
The measure ignited fresh controversy in recent days, as hospitals warned against adjusting the assessment rates from 6% to 3.5%. Over the weekend, members of U.S. Senate began floor debate on the bill, which key Republican senators like Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, had said they would not vote to advance because of the assessments adjustment proposal and the damage it could do to rural hospitals in their states.
Late Saturday, Hawley and all but two other GOP senators voted to advance a new version of the bill that included a $25 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 to 2032. Critics, however, still caution that fund will not fill the financial gaps as states lose portions of federal funding through the Medicaid cuts.
In a call with reporters on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia said he doesn’t plan to vote for the bill as it stands. The week prior his Senate colleague, Democrat Tim Kaine said the same. As the bill proceeds to what is called a vote-a-rama, Senate Democrats have remained in opposition to the bill.
The possible Medicaid changes are part of an overall budget package that President Donald Trump dubbed the “one big beautiful bill” and has pressured Congress to send to his desk by July 4.  While there is still more time for deliberations before the Senate votes whether to send the bill to Trump and he potentially signs the Medicaid changes into law, hospital associations warned in their letter that if he does, vulnerable, already-cash-strapped hospitals would struggle to keep their doors open or need to cut the services they offer.
“Stable funding is vital not only for serving Medicaid beneficiaries but also for providing care to all patients, including the uninsured, those with commercial insurance, and our seniors and disabled patients on Medicare,” the associations wrote, representing hospitals in North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. “Severe cuts to Medicaid inevitably would lead to cuts in healthcare services for all Americans.”
The hospital funding mechanisms aren’t the only Medicaid changes that Congress is considering.
A version of the bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives includes work requirements to access Medicaid. Though most Medicaid recipients do work, some use Medicaid while they are unable to work due to disabilities or illness. Such is the case for Richmond-area resident Aida Pacheco’s daughter who is out of work while she battles cancer.

Still, the twice-a-year-proof of employment required by that version of the bill could make it challenging for eligible people to stay on Medicaid and overwhelm some government employees with additional work, Warner said. 
He referred to the bill as “budget gimmickery” riddled with “poison pills,” from Medicaid changes to cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits — which could place additional cost burdens on local and state governments. Twenty-three governors have sent a letter to Congress on that matter recently, which Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin didn’t sign. 
Meanwhile, some of Virginia’s federal lawmakers would like to see the president sign the House version of the bill.
Last week Virginia’s 1st District congressman Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, joined a letter in opposition to the Senate draft that reiterated support for the House version of the bill.

“The House’s approach reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard, and we urge that it be retained in the final bill,” they wrote. “Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers.”
After the House’s version of the bill passed by a single vote, Democrats blasted Wittman for his support of it, which could affect about 250,000 Virginians. Wittman asserts eligible Medicaid recipients will not lose coverage and has noted his personal connection to the program. Medicaid coverage allowed his birth mother to continue her pregnancy and his parents to eventually adopt him, he said.
“I know firsthand what access to care means for families like mine,” Wittman said in a recent statement.
 Back to the drawing board?

Amid all the pushback to the Medicaid tweaks in the bill, the Senate’s parliamentarian set Republican’s plans back in a Thursday ruling that found several measures didn’t comply with the federal reconciliation process. Lawmakers then spent the weekend reworking the bill. Though Republicans didn’t back down on their sought changes to the hospital provider taxes in Medicaid, they agreed for the cuts to be delayed and incremental. 
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

As an adviser to the chamber, Thune has said lawmakers won’t challenge the parliamentarian’s ruling, which included other reforms they’ve sought, like reducing federal funds to states that use their own tax dollars to provide Medicaid coverage to immigrants and a bar on patients tapping into Medicaid for gender-affirming care.
Thune told Politico late last week that Republicans may not get “everything that we want” on the provider tax, but that he hopes his party can salvage “most of the reforms.”
Warner said he hopes Republican congresspeople will be “willing to go back to the drawing board and actually work with both parties.”
For now, he thinks it will be “a bumpy next couple of days, but this is a bad bill for America. It’s a bad bill for Virginia.”

The USDA reports that 30% of the National Forest System lands are restricted from road development through this rule. The Trump Administration has framed this as an impediment to the land being managed for fire risk and said it is hindering economic development in rural America.
“Once again, President Trump is removing absurd obstacles to common sense management of our natural resources by rescinding the overly restrictive roadless rule,” said USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins in a meeting of the Western Governors’ Association. “This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation’s forests. It is abundantly clear that properly managing our forests preserves them from devastating fires and allows future generations of Americans to enjoy and reap the benefits of this great land.”
The rule was created as a way to maintain some of the least-developed parts of the nation to protect wildlife, clean water, recreation and old-growth forests. The rule has been contested in the courts many times as states sought to utilize the lands but has been upheld in most cases.
As for the agency’s concerns over wildfires, the rule already has exemptions to manage fuel reduction through thinning of trees, prescribed burns, creating fuel breaks and removing brush. However, logging groups feel it’s not sufficient to address the dangers the forests face from wildfires.
“With those limited exceptions it hasn’t been enough to effectively manage the forest and reduce wildfire hazards and the disease infestation of bugs,” said Scott Dane, Executive Director of the American Loggers Council.
Dane said that limiting access to these lands has, in a way, contributed to shutting down logging across the country with the collapse of the mill infrastructure. From the logging perspective, he said the Roadless Rule was an anti-logging industry policy and stepped away from proper management of the national forests.
“Look at the catastrophic wildfires that we’ve had, and the U.S. Forest Service has come out with a wildfire crisis plan, because it is a crisis. The only way you can reduce the wildfire threats is to reduce the fuel loads, and the fuel loads are excessive right now,” Dane said. “The U.S. Forest Service needs to get back to managing the national forest like they used to do. And this rule, in and of itself, is not the sole reason that the health of the National Forest has declined over the last 25-30 years, but it’s one of the reasons.”
Environmental groups were quick to denounce the move by the federal government to open forestlands. The Southern Environmental Law Center said the rule was especially important for the southeast where land has been fragmented by roadbuilding and mining.
“They are the places that you’re gonna find old-growth forests. Virginia is lucky to have a lot of old-growth forest where you can find it in these roadless areas,” said Sam Evans, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Virginia also is lucky to have a wealth of clean streams and rivers. Five-hundred and forty miles of rivers in Virginia alone are protected primarily by the roadless rule.”
Even with the roadless rule’s future in question, the protected lands won’t be opened to free-for-all development. Formal rulemaking to undo the rule will be needed and it is likely to be challenged in court, as past changes were during the Bush Administration. 
“The Forest Service is going to have to explain why those things aren’t important enough to protect anymore. It is hard for me to see how they could do that credibly,” Evans said.
Another hurdle: even if the rule is rescinded, logging projects would still need to go through the Forest Service’s application process, which is subject to review in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.
But logging is not the only industry that could expand if the rule is undone. Oil and gas, hydropower, and mining could utilize the protected lands. Evans said when the rule originally was proposed in January 2001, most supporters said they wanted these protections in place for the wilderness portions of the country. He suggests it will be difficult for the Forest Service to convince the public the land should be allowed to be developed.
“An unprecedented number of people showed up to say that they wanted these protections, and that has continued to be true across the board irrespective of political affiliation, whether you live in the city, or you are in a rural area,” Evans said. “People really care about protecting the integrity of these lands and don’t want to see them converted into timber production.”

(Photo by Catherine Lane/Getty Images)Students in Virginia who rely on Pell Grants to help pay for college may soon face higher costs under a sweeping set of federal education reforms being considered by the U.S. Senate.
The Pell Grant program is the primary source of federal financial aid for low-income students, supporting degree completion at both public and private institutions. During the 2023-24 school year, Virginia’s public and private universities reported to the state that they had 144,116 Pell Grant recipients.
“It has been one of the great successes in helping lower-income families and students pursue a degree,” said Sabena Moretz, director of government relations and member services for the Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia (CICV). 
According to CIVC, 82% of students at Virginia’s private colleges receive financial aid, with an average award of $25,000. The association represents 28 accredited, nonprofit, independent colleges and universities around the commonwealth.
However, the proposed changes come as no surprise.
Back in 2016, President Donald Trump took aggressive steps to roll back Obama-era higher education measures, including a proposal to rescind the Gainful Employment Regulations that aimed to protect students from predatory programs.
In the latest effort, the Trump administration is backing a new legislative push dubbed the “One Big Beautiful bill,” a package of higher education reforms that includes changes to federal student loan programs, repayment rules, and institutional accountability. Supporters say the reforms would expand the Pell Grant to workforce training programs and help break the student debt cycle. 
Meanwhile, Democrats have opposed the bill, arguing that it would make college less affordable, eliminate borrower safeguards and protect predatory colleges.
One proposal in the bill would prohibit students from receiving a Pell Grant if their total grant aid from federal, state, institutional and private sources meets or exceeds their total cost of attendance — the estimated expenses for one year of college. These costs typically include tuition, room and board, and textbooks.
The changes are set to take effect on July 1, 2026.
A spokesperson for the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, declined to comment on the proposal. However, the office stated that it’s uncommon for financial aid to exceed a student’s costs of attendance.
“Having total aid exceed cost of attendance would be a rare occurrence, though it does happen,” said Lee Andes, SCHEV’s director of finance policy and innovation. “Since most financial aid rules (including the state) would require a reduction in aid under the scenario described, the student would receive no harm under the new federal policy compared to current policy.”  
Andes said that under both policies, a student would be limited to receiving no more aid than the total cost of attendance. 
“Traditionally, Pell has been treated as a first-in grant; this policy makes it somewhat ambiguous how it would be treated and which programs are reduced first. I would anticipate federal guidance to follow any change in the law,” Andes said.
CIVC said it is monitoring the discussion but remains concerned about how the proposal could impact students and institutions. Students at CIVC member institutions received $214 million in Pell funds during the 2023-24 school year. Moretz said if students find the application process difficult, they may choose to not enroll. 
In addition, if students no longer receive such grants, they may be unable to attend those institutions at all.
“The more complicated we make financial aid, the less likely students are to be able to follow along and to be successful at getting through the application process, and that does not serve students well,” Moretz said.
Virginia is not alone in its concerns about how the bill could impact students and colleges.
Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, wrote in a May 21 letter to House representatives that the council is concerned about changes to the Pell Grant eligibility, the availability of federal student loans for graduate students, new and increased taxes imposed on institutions of higher education, and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.
“If enacted, this bill will put college out of reach for hundreds of thousands of students, significantly increase the costs for remaining students, and weaken America’s ability to compete with our global rivals by undermining the academic and research system that has driven our economy for decades,” Mitchell wrote.
The Senate is also considering eliminating the Grad PLUS loan program, which provides funding for graduate students, potentially forcing them to seek private loans. Additionally, lawmakers are  weighing a new endowment tax targeting wealthy private institutions.
The endowment tax would raise the current 1.4% on private university endowments to a tiered rate based on endowment per U.S. student, excluding non-U.S. citizens from the calculation.
Democrats and other critics argue that the tax could also reduce funding for financial aid, research, and other essential operations.
The Senate is currently reviewing the bill, which passed the House last month.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)At one time or another, every one of us is impacted by a health emergency or life-changing event like the birth of a child. These moments in our lives can be all-encompassing, even when the underlying event is a joyful one.
Ask any parent. 
Adjusting to life with a baby is rich with stress, especially for single mothers like me. I am a single mom by choice. I gave birth to my son in May 2023. 
As a teacher, I received no paid time off for his birth. But because I gave birth at the end of May, I was able to stay home with him through the summer. 
Knowing that I did not want to leave my son at three-months-old, I took my 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave in the fall and returned to work after Thanksgiving.
I spent the full year before his birth squirreling away every cent I could save, even diverting the money I would have invested toward my retirement. I managed to save $12,000, which was no easy task. However, it was nowhere near enough to support my son and me. It was gone, along with other savings, before it was time for me to return to work. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thankfully, I have a very supportive family and was able to keep my head above water. 
Barely.
But here we are, my son just turned two-years-old in May, and I am still working to put myself back into a financial situation I’m more accustomed to and comfortable with at this point.
It is not easy. 
With a monthly daycare bill of $1,650, there is not much left over to spend at the end of the month, as I try to put a cushion back under my little family. 
My story is not unique. Many parents want to take time off to care for their newborns but find it financially impossible to do so.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Many countries offer paid family leave for new parents. So do 13 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., including four of our neighbors, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York.
There is no reason that Pennsylvania cannot do the same by offering paid family and medical leave for people who experience serious health conditions or life-changing events, like the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child. Leave should also be available to people who are caring for sick loved ones as well as victims of domestic violence.
A program like this would give Pennsylvania parents like me peace of mind by allowing them to care for their newborns without going broke. It would also allow family members to provide critical care to elderly loved ones at home without having to risk their jobs or financial security.

It is no wonder that a March 2025 poll by Osage Research for Children’s First PA found that 81% of Pennsylvanians support a paid family and medical leave program.
It’s also a win for employers who want to hang on to great employees. Studies (here, here and here) show that women with limited paid family leave are more likely to leave employment after childbirth or a health emergency, while those with paid family leave are more likely to return.
I wouldn’t change anything about the first six months of my son’s life, but I know that not everyone can do what I did. It breaks my heart to think of new moms returning to work just six or seven weeks after giving birth.
We can do better. We can empower working Pennsylvanians to provide critical care to their families when they need them. And we can do it in a way that benefits employees and employers, while keeping good people in their jobs.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)In Wise County earlier this month I met the candidate daring enough, or foolish enough, to run against the most powerful Republican member of Virginia’s House of Delegates. 
When I walked into the community center in Norton, where I was to give a presentation at the invitation of the Clinch River Coalition, I found a volunteer wrangling wires to plug in the audio equipment. He was introduced to me as Josh Outsey, the man who had taken on the thankless job of Democratic challenger to Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, in this fall’s election. 
Before I could stop myself, I laughed. Terry Kilgore has been in the House for 31 years, and ran unopposed in the last three elections. A politically powerful member of a politically powerful family, Kilgore represents a district that’s over 92% White and voted 83.1% for Donald J. Trump. The 63-year-old lawyer was recently elected House Republican leader.
Kilgore chosen to lead Va. House GOP as Gilbert prepares for possible exit

Joshua Outsey (pronounced OOT-see), 38, is a Black actor, singer and community organizer. As of June 5, Kilgore had raised $469,509, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Outsey had raised $200. 
Outsey gives a respectable pitch for his candidacy, grounded in both experience and policy. If this were a contest for a seat in a more balanced district, I’d have no business being amused. But no one, least of all Outsey, is under any illusions that he can unseat Kilgore. 
Still, I am filled with admiration. It is one thing to say that democracy works best when voters have choices, and quite another to agree to make yourself that choice against impossible odds. 
I’ve seen up close what even a hopeless campaign can require. A couple or three decades ago, my friend Tom Horton ran for Congress against a well-funded Republican incumbent who was firmly entrenched in Virginia politics. Tom had no trouble securing the Democratic nomination – nobody else wanted it – but he didn’t have money for a staff, and he needed a policy director. I was at home with young children and glad for the mental stimulation, so I signed on. 
Unburdened by any real prospect of success, I had a great time writing position papers based largely on my own opinions. Every once in a while, I would stop and ask myself, “I wonder what Tom thinks about this?” then shrug and plunge on. Very occasionally, Tom would balk at a position I proposed he take, and then we would talk it out.
But mostly, he didn’t have time for that. Poor Tom spent every day of the campaign on the phone trying to raise money. In the evenings he knocked on doors. If he was lucky, sometimes he was interviewed on the radio or got a quote in the paper. It was an uphill slog all the way, and none of it mattered. He lost by about the same wide margin that polls had shown him losing by at the outset of the campaign. 
He had to be disappointed, but Tom told me he loved every minute of it and would run again in a heartbeat, if he didn’t have a family to support.
Maybe this is why I have a special place in my heart for underdogs. People like Tom who try, knowing they are likely to fail, and then indeed do fail, only to pick themselves up and say it was worth it anyway – they are heroes to me. Winners are dull by comparison. 
Outsey is far from being the only sacrificial lamb this election. Democrats are fielding candidates in every House race this fall, including other long-shot seats like those held by Will Morefield, another coalfields delegate who won in 2023 with 85% of the vote, and Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, who won his Shenandoah Valley district by more than 77%.
Republicans are not similarly contesting every seat, but some are taking on Democratic incumbents even in deep blue districts, including a few who are making a repeat appearance on the ballot.
These include retired technology professional Kristin Hoffman, who is challenging McLean Democratic Del. Rip Sullivan for the second time, in spite of losing by 23 points in the last election. A few miles to the east, in another Fairfax County district that voted overwhelmingly for Harris over Trump last fall, retired federal worker Ed McGovern will face Del. Kathy Tran for a third time. He lost by 20 points in 2021 and 30 points in 2023.  
I was unsuccessful in trying to reach these folks, so I don’t know their motivations. Regardless, I salute them.
Running against impossible odds can serve a purpose beyond dedication to the democratic process. Democrat Melody Cartwright told a Cardinal News reporter that she sees running for a second time against Del. Eric Phillips, R-Henry, after losing in 2023 by 40 points, as a way to support Abigail Spanberger’s gubernatorial campaign. She added candidly that forcing Republicans to spend money to defend Phillips’ seat would leave them less money to attack Democrats elsewhere.
Despite tough challenge, don’t underestimate Earle-Sears

Running for office with no expectation of winning can also be a tactic for raising awareness of a neglected cause, as many a Green Party candidate can attest. My colleague at the Mercury, Roger Chesley, recalls a candidate by the name of Gail Parker who ran for various local, state and federal offices seven times between 2006 and 2019. Calling herself “Gail for Rail,” she campaigned on the single issue of promoting light rail. A 2007 Washington Post headline snarkily called her a “One-Track Candidate.” Fair enough, but the record will reflect that Metro now extends out to Loudoun County. 
Deep in the heart of every candidate, of course, is the hope that lightning may strike. The opponent might stumble badly enough, or voters suddenly realize that who they wanted all along was someone just like the scrappy upstart, leading to an upset victory. 
It has happened. In a 2014 primary, libertarian college professor David Brat defeated Congressman Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader at the time, in an upset that shocked the political establishment and gave hope to long-shot candidates everywhere. Brat won the general election, too, and served two terms.
Brat’s win over Cantor, followed by his loss to a Democrat in 2018 – to Abigail Spanberger, as it happened – demonstrates a final point: the political winds can shift suddenly, and when it happens, the people who benefit are the ones who’ve got their sails ready. 
Democrats have been able to field so many candidates this year because they sense such a shift coming as part of a backlash to the Trump presidency. Republicans say otherwise. Still, no matter which party wins control this fall, the outcome won’t help the longest of long-shot candidates. 
But that’s okay. Just running is a win for democracy.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)Renewed efforts by some lawmakers for the state to adopt a system where voters elect the state’s constitutional officers again failed this year. 
Maine is an outlier in having the Legislature appoint constitutional officers and state auditors. Rather than giving that power to state legislators, most states popularly elect their treasurer, secretary of state and attorney general. States vary more on how they select auditors. 
For decades, some lawmakers have proposed changing the selection process, such as allowing the public to decide instead through a direct popular election, but such attempts have failed. 
The Maine House of Representatives and Senate killed all of the proposals to change the selection process this year. 
LD 455, sponsored by Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), would have amended the constitution to require the popular election of the secretary of state, attorney general and state treasurer. Both chambers voted against it, so it died upon adjournment on Wednesday.  
LD 508, sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), sought to essentially do the same. The Senate indefinitely postponed it on June 11, killing the bill, on a motion from Bennett. 
Other bills, all sponsored by House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), focused on switching to popular elections for specific positions. 
LD 150 proposed a constitutional amendment to allow for the popular election of the state treasurer. It also died after the Senate followed the House in rejecting it earlier this month.  
That’s also the case for LD 147, which proposed a constitutional amendment to require the popular election of the secretary of state, and LD 149 that would do so for the attorney general. 
Bennett also offered an alternative election process for constitutional officers and the state auditor in LD 1193. Instead of a popular election, this bill would still have the Legislature elect these positions but with an open ballot system, under which a lawmaker’s vote would be publicly available. 
However, LD 1193 remained tabled in the Senate upon adjournment. Since it was not one of the bills carried over into next year, the bill died when the Legislature adjourned on Wednesday. 
Sen. Richard Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) proposed in LD 1068 switching to popularly elect the state auditor, though not through a constitutional amendment. That bill also remained tabled in the Senate upon adjournment and died since it was not carried over. 
The state auditor is not a constitutional officer, however another bill, LD 1052, sought to make it one through a constitutional amendment. 
Sponsored by Rep. Suzanne Salisbury (D-Westbrook), the bill passed both chambers in initial votes, however failed enactment in the House, which was the crucial vote as constitutional amendments need to win the support of two-thirds of lawmakers for enactment. The bill was then placed on what’s called the appropriations table because it required funding. 
Constitutional amendments ultimately have to be approved by voters even if they pass the Legislature, and therefore always have associated ballot costs. 
The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which manages the table, decided not to fund LD 1052 this year but it will be carried over into next year for consideration. (More on that here.) Though, if funded next year, this bill would still face a steep path to passage given the failed enactment in the House.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Thursday marked the last chance for New Hampshire lawmakers to approve or reject the remaining bills of this year’s legislative session.
While passage of a state budget was the main focus in Concord, lawmakers also voted on several bills that came out of this month’s committees of conference. The committees, made up of House and Senate negotiators, formulated compromises on bills that both chambers had passed but in different forms. On Thursday, the full chambers voted to either accept the compromises or kill the bills.
Bills passed on Thursday now head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, where she will have the option to sign them into law, veto them, or allow them to become law without her signature. Meanwhile, other hotly debated bills met their demise Thursday.
Here’s a look at some of the votes.
Gender affirming care for minors banned
After an emotionally charged debate, Republicans in the House and Senate passed two bills that would ban all gender transition surgery and medication treatment for minors. 
House Bill 712 prevents New Hampshire doctors from performing breast surgeries to assist with gender transitions; the bill would allow such surgeries only to treat “malignancy, injury, infection, or malformation.”
And House Bill 377 bars doctors from prescribing hormone therapies and puberty blockers to minors for the purpose of gender transition, as well.
The two bills, if signed by Ayotte, would come on the heels of a 2024 law that banned gender transition genital surgeries
The bills passed a week after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of such state laws in U.S. v. Skrmetti. 
Democrats denounced the bills, saying they would prevent adolescents with gender dysphoria from obtaining treatment that could improve their lives and prevent depression and suicide, and arguing that the decision of whether to pursue such treatment should be made by doctors and parents.
Republicans said there is not enough research backing up the treatments, and raised concerns that the treatments could be permanent and create trauma if children later regretted them.
Libraries and kids’ borrowing histories
Another bill accepted Thursday and headed to the governor’s desk seeks to allow parents access to their children’s borrowing history at public libraries.
House Bill 273, if signed by Ayotte, would require public libraries to make children’s borrowing histories available to their parents or legal guardians upon request. Under current state law, all library records are confidential outside of subpoenas, court orders, and the like. This bill would carve out an exception to that. 
Before Thursday’s vote, Rep. Bob Lynn, a Windham Republican, called the bill “another chapter in the continuing saga of protecting parental rights” and said it “is another chapter to complete, or almost complete, the circle” created when the Legislature passed — and Ayotte signed into law — House Bill 10.
HB 10, dubbed the Parental Bill of Rights, guarantees New Hampshire parents the right to ask school personnel for any information about what their child is doing at school and get complete disclosure. This sparked criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates, who were concerned teachers would be forced to out young gay or trans kids. The bill also reaffirms parents’ right to opt their children out of sex education classes, exempt them from vaccine requirements with a doctor’s note or because of religious belief, and home school them, among other things. Much of what is contained in HB 10 was already allowed, but the new law enshrined it into state law. Finally, the bill also required school boards to create new policies promoting parental involvement in their children’s education.
Many Democrats opposed the bill, however, including Rep. Paul Berch, a Westmoreland Democrat. Birch cited the bill’s lack of specificity about how a library would verify that someone is in fact a child’s parent.
“Why are we going to turn over private records without any verification,” he asked on the House floor.
A committee of conference last week simply had to agree on an effective date. Both parties quickly agreed on Jan. 1.
School buildings and migrant shelters
Both the House and Senate accepted a bill to prevent school buildings from being used as migrant shelters Thursday — after an unrelated provision regarding local property valuation was added to the bill.
House Bill 71, if signed by the governor, will forbid New Hampshire public schools, colleges, and universities from housing immigrants. Any school in violation would lose state funding. The legislation makes exceptions for short-term shelter during natural disasters, such as hurricanes or snowstorms.
However, when the Senate considered the bill, it added requirements for municipalities changing property valuations. The new provision seeks to require towns and cities with 10,000 or more people to publicize a change to a property valuation in a newspaper, online, and social media.
The bill was passed over the opposition of some Democrats. Rep. Muriel Hall, a Bow Democrat, said on the House floor Thursday that the legislation “infringes on local governments’ ability to effectively govern and make decisions about their own facilities, which could be empty for periods of time.”
Tilton Republican Rep. Lisa Freeman dismissed those concerns, saying “there’s a carve-out for states of emergency” in the legislation.
Voting bills sail through
The House and Senate passed a handful of bills designed to create stricter scrutiny of absentee ballots, amid a general push by Republicans to introduce more voter verification measures at the polls. 
Senate Bill 218 would require that those registering to vote as an absentee include documentary proof of citizenship, age, domicile, and identity with their registration form. The bill requires that that person registering sign an affidavit attesting to each of those qualifications under penalty of voter fraud, and it also requires a witness to sign an affidavit stating that they observed the registrant sign the application form and that the registrant “satisfied” the witness regarding their identity. 
Senate Bill 287 necessitates that people applying for absentee ballots include a copy of their identification as well as a signature from a licensed notary in order to obtain the ballot by mail. The applicant would not need a notarized signature if they appeared before their town or city clerk to apply for the absentee ballot ahead of the election.
Republican supporters say the bills would close off opportunities for voter fraud via the absentee ballot system. Voting rights groups countered that the bills would create high hurdles on voters with disabilities.
The Legislature on Thursday also passed a bill, House Bill 67, to require cities and towns to provide accessible voting machines in local elections — such as municipal elections and annual town meetings — and to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of State’s Office to share those machines. Under the bill, municipalities would be required to pay the costs to program the machines for their ballots.
But lawmakers also passed House Bill 613, which allows a town or city to not provide accessible voting machines provided they posted an announcement at least three months before the election asking voters to request the machines be available in writing. If no voter did so at least 60 days before the election, the municipality would not need to provide the machine, HB 613 states.
And finally, the House and Senate passed Senate Bill 221, which requires supervisors of the checklist to conduct an annual, comprehensive review of their lists of registered voters and to purge any voters that should not be on the list. Currently that review is required only once every 10 years, though election officials update voter rolls as they receive death notices. 
Lawmakers approve end-of-lease bill
Lawmakers passed a bill allowing landlords to terminate a tenancy at the end of the lease period with no “good cause” needed, which Republicans say is necessary to protect the sanctity of the contract.
House Bill 60 would apply to leases 12 months in length or longer, and would allow a landlord to stop renting to a tenant at the end of the lease period with no reason given as long as the landlord has given 60 days of notice. 
The legislation does not allow discriminatory evictions and states that the current anti-retaliation laws are still in place. 
But tenants’ rights advocates have criticized the legislation, which they say could still make it easier for landlords to discriminate against tenants without easy consequences, and which they argue will increase evictions and homelessness.
Republicans say allowing an easier means for landlords to end a lease means they will be more likely to take chances on tenants with poor credit scores or evictions on their record, knowing they can end the contract if it does not work out.
The final version of the bill exempts any “no cause” termination of tenancy from appearing as an eviction on the tenant’s record, addressing some concerns.
Mandatory minimums and shrooms
One bill that didn’t get approval from both chambers Thursday was Senate Bill 14.
That bill sought to impose mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted on fentanyl charges in New Hampshire. The bill would’ve required judges to sentence those convicted with 20 grams or more of the drug to at least 3½ years in prison, and those convicted with 50 or more grams would be sentenced to no less than seven years. Currently, there’s no minimum sentence for fentanyl charges under state law, meaning judges have more discretion. However, there is a maximum of 30 years for first-time offenders and life imprisonment for repeat offenders.
The bill, though, contained more than fentanyl sentencing. After the Senate passed it, Republican Reps. Kevin Verville and Terry Roy added a new provision to lessen criminal penalties for psilocybin, the psychedelic drug colloquially known as shrooms or magic mushrooms. The new amendment would’ve turned possession or use of less than three-quarters of an ounce of psilocybin from a felony into a misdemeanor on first offense. Verville, who has championed other bills meant to reduce punishments for certain drugs like psilocybin or marijuana, has argued psilocybin is much less dangerous than fentanyl and that it has medicinal benefits, such as treatment for PTSD and migraines.
Thursday morning, the House initially voted 183-186 to reject the compromise version of the bill. However, after a midday recess, the House regrouped and brought the bill back for reconsideration and on a second vote approved it, 185-182.
“Never stop the drive until you score,” Rep. Jason Osborne, House majority leader and a proponent of the bill, wrote on social media following the second vote.
However, the bill’s newfound hope subsequently died when the Senate considered it. The Senate voted to table it at the request of Sen. Bill Gannon, a Sandown Republican. Gannon had previously told House negotiators in the committee of conference that the psilocybin add-on was a nonstarter for the Senate. However, he was soon replaced on the committee by Sen. Daryl Abbas, a Salem Republican and vocal backer of mandatory minimums. The committee then approved a compromise deal with both the mandatory minimums and reduced psilocybin penalties. However, Gannon rallied enough Republicans to join with Democrats and shoot down the bill Thursday.
Enacting mandatory minimums was a legislative priority for Ayotte, who made it a campaign promise and has been publicly calling on lawmakers to get a bill across the finish line.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/campaignpromises-1024x554.jpg,,,2025-06-30 05:05:48.216339

In recent years, North Carolina Republican lawmakers have perfected the practice of rigging elections through partisan gerrymandering.
The situation has gotten so bad that they don’t even pretend anymore. They not only openly rig districts to disenfranchise voters who don’t vote Republican, they openly admit and brag about it.
And now, in a bill rammed through a House committee last week in record time, they’re bringing the same approach to election laws and the people who administer them.
Under a bill unveiled last week right before lawmakers commenced a summer break, the staff of the state Board of Elections – a group that’s always been scrupulously nonpartisan – would be transformed so that more than a third of existing staff positions would be converted to political appointees selected only by Republicans.
The bill includes other objectionable provisions too, including one that, –I’m not making this up– prevents local election boards from encouraging people to vote.
The bottom line: Election rigging through gerrymandering in our state is already scandalous. The new proposal is simply a travesty.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Changes will be made to the way abortions are reported in Ohio, according to the state operating budget the legislature passed last week. Meanwhile, infant and maternal funding are seeing reductions compared to previous versions of the budget.
Also, millions were set aside to provide ultrasound equipment specifically for entities that do not inform patients about abortion procedures and services as an option.
The Ohio General Assembly passed the state operating budget bill out of a joint conference committee last week, sending the bill to Gov. Mike DeWine for his signature, and possible line-item vetoes of his choosing.
The budget included language making changes to the Ohio Department of Health’s annual abortion report, and established a new monthly report as part of the changes. A “public electronic dashboard” will also be published monthly, according to budget documents.
Data collection for both the annual and monthly reports would now include the total number of Ohio residents versus non-Ohio residents who have “undergone an abortion and received post-abortion care,” according to the budget. Physicians are required to fill out reports on both surgical and medication abortions, which Jaime Miracle, deputy director of advocacy group Abortion Forward, said just adds to the bureaucracy that bogs down proper medical care.
“No one wants to wait longer to see a doctor because they’re busy completing extra paperwork to satisfy some politician’s agenda,” Miracle said. “Ohio already has some of the most medically unnecessary and burdensome reporting requirements around abortion care. No other medical procedure is required to be reported in the way abortion is.”

Those reports would get information on the patient down to the ZIP code of the pregnant individual, something pro-abortion rights advocates have said is a privacy issue.
“Sharing ZIP code level data is a threat to patient data and privacy and has no business being in the state budget,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.
Age categories would be altered under the budget bill, moving categories to younger than 16, 16 to 17 and 18 to 24.
The total of number of minors who received abortions will be included in the monthly and annual reports, separated out by the facility who performed the abortion. The number of abortions a patient has received and the total number of in-state versus out-of-state patients will also be broken down by age.
The deadline for the reports was also moved up by legislators. The public report will now be issued March 1 rather than Oct. 1.
  Separate provisions 
In other abortion-related budget provisions, the conference committee kept a provision from DeWine’s executive proposal that requires the Ohio Department of Health’s Genetic Services fund to be used for newborn screenings and genetic disease programs, but prohibited the use of the funds for abortion counseling or referral, “except in the case of a medical emergency.”
While the conference committee kept the overall provision, including the prohibition, it removed the exception for medical emergencies.
Kept intact was a Senate provision that gives $5 over the biennium to the Ohio Department of Children and Youth for the purchase of “3D diagnostic ultrasound machines,” to be distributed through a grant program.
The budget specifies, however, that the entities who are eligible to receive the ultrasound machines are those who do not “promote abortion, perform abortion-related medical procedures or make referrals for abortions.”
This could go to so-called pregnancy resource centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, which are typically religiously based and center their information and services on promoting pregnancy and discouraging abortion. The state – and DeWine through executive orders – has funded the centers with grant programs in the Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which has clear exceptions for those who provide abortion services or information.
The new budget even includes up to $750 per year in personal income tax deductions for those who donate to the centers, which could cost the state about $900,000 per year, according to budget documents.
Reproductive rights advocates have said not only do the anti-abortion measures pushed by the legislature negatively impact the state’s already low-ranking maternal and infant mortality rate, but the attention and money spent on anti-abortion measures take away from improvements that could be made.
The total appropriation for the “infant vitality” budget line went down from $20 million in the Ohio House proposal to $18 million in the conference committee-approved document. That number is a slight jump from the $16.8 million the state estimates for the fund in the current fiscal year.
Legislators gave $5 million to “programming by community and local faith-based service providers that invest in maternal health programs” and provide services to support pregnant mothers. But that number dropped in the budget process, from $7.5 million in the governor’s proposal and $6 million in the House proposal.
The final budget document removed a provision to use up to $1 million for non-medical services at residential infant care centers.
A provision to fund research looking into “causes, diagnoses, prevention and treatment” of pediatric cancer stayed cut in half from DeWine’s proposal, with the conference committee sticking to the House’s $5 million for fiscal year 2026, rather than the $10 million the governor had proposed.
$1.6 million was cut from funding for community projects that support “families, assisting families in avoiding crisis, and crisis intervention.”
The conference committee budget did include $5 million in each fiscal year from a Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, to be used to implement grant activities in “prenatal, maternal, perinatal and infant domains.”
A mental health block grant was also funded with $1.7 million each fiscal year for infant and early childhood mental health activities, and $6 million each year in funds from tobacco use prevention, cessation and enforcement would be used for awards, prioritizing “entities that serve women who reside in communities that have the highest infant mortality rates.”

Utah and other states have pushed the federal government to hand over public lands, and a sweeping proposal in Congress could put millions of acres up for sale. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Hunters, hikers and outdoors lovers of all stripes mounted a campaign this month against a Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public land.
The public outcry was so forceful that the measure’s sponsor pledged to scale back the proposal. Then on Saturday, before an initial U.S. Senate vote on Republicans’ mega tax and spending bill, he withdrew it altogether.
But even though the land sales proposal was defeated, experts say federal lands face a slew of other threats from President Donald Trump’s administration. Agency leaders have proposed rolling back the “Roadless Rule” that protects 58 million acres from logging and other uses. Trump’s Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the president is allowed to abolish national monuments. Regulators have moved to slash environmental rules to ramp up logging and oil and gas production. And Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce have gutted the ranks of the agencies that manage federal lands.
“This is not over even if the sell-off proposal doesn’t make it,” said John Leshy, who served as solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration. “The whole thing about leasing or selling timber or throwing them open to mining claims, that’s a form of partial privatization. It’s pretty much a giveaway.”
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has repeatedly described public lands as America’s “balance sheet.” He has argued that some lands could be used to provide housing, while calling for an expansion of mining and oil and gas drilling to increase their economic output.
“President Trump’s energy dominance vision will end those wars abroad, will make life more affordable for every family in America by driving down inflation,” Burgum said before his confirmation hearing.
Public lands advocates are bracing for ongoing battles for the rest of Trump’s term in office. They expect Republicans to add last-minute public lands amendments to other bills moving through Congress, and for land management agencies to attempt to strip protections from other federal lands. Given the vocal backlash to the initial sell-off plan, advocates expect future attempts to be shaped behind closed doors and advanced with little time for opponents to mount a defense.
Meanwhile, they expect states to play a key role in shaping those battles. In Western states, where most federally owned lands are located, many leaders from both parties view public lands as special places open to all Americans and critical for clean water, wildlife and tourism. But some conservatives resent the fact that large portions of their states are managed by officials in Washington, D.C., limiting development and private enterprise.
Officials in some states, including Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, have pushed lawsuits or resolutions seeking to force the feds to hand over huge amounts of land. Public land experts say the lawmakers behind those efforts will likely press harder now that Trump is in the White House. Such state-level takeover attempts could shape the proposals that emerge from Trump’s allies in Washington.
Sell-off proposal
The firestorm over federal lands exploded when Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, introduced legislation that would force the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 3.3 million acres of land. The measure also would direct the agencies to make more than 250 million additional acres eligible for sale.
“We’ve never seen a threat on this magnitude ever,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “There’s been an overwhelming amount of opposition. We’ve seen record-breaking engagement on this issue.”
Lee, a longtime federal lands opponent, claimed the lands were needed for housing and argued the government has been a poor manager of its land.
“Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land,” Lee said earlier this month when announcing the proposal. “This bill puts it in better hands.”
But a wide-ranging coalition of opponents argued that the proposal had no protections to ensure the lands would be used for affordable housing, and that many of the parcels eligible for sale had little housing potential. A furious social media campaign highlighted cherished hiking trails, fishing lakes and ski slopes that were in danger of being sold, urging people to call their lawmakers to oppose the measure.
In recent days, Montana Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, as well as Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, came out in opposition to the land sale proposal. That put into question whether Lee’s legislation could earn even a simple majority.
Then the Senate parliamentarian ruled the sell-off could not be included in the reconciliation bill without a 60-vote majority. That ruling came a day after Lee posted on social media that he would be making changes to the bill in response to concerns from Hunter Nation, a nonprofit whose board includes Donald Trump Jr.
Lee released a scaled-back measure last week that would exempt national forest lands but would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell up to 1.2 million acres. It would require land for sale to be within five miles of a population center and developed to provide housing.
Public land advocates say Lee’s changes did little to assuage their concerns. They argue that federal land sales or transfers should happen through the current, long-standing process, which requires local stakeholder input and directs the proceeds from land sales to be reinvested into conservation and public access on other parcels.
“It’s the overwhelming belief of hunters and anglers that the budget reconciliation process is not the appropriate vehicle for public land sales,” said O’Dea, with the hunting and fishing group.
On Saturday evening, Lee announced that he was withdrawing the proposal, saying that Senate rules did not allow him to include protections that land would not be sold to foreign interests. But he pledged to continue the battle over federal land ownership, working with Trump to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.”
States’ role
While the sell-off proposal aligned with some state officials’ goal of taking over federal lands, some lands experts say private developers would have been the real winner.
“If the lands are transferred to the states without money, the states lose,” said Leshy, the former Interior Department official. “It’s a hit on their budget, which means they’re gonna have to sell them off. If states got a significant amount of public lands, a lot of that would end up in private hands.”
In Utah, where leaders have made the most aggressive push to take over federal lands, lawmakers argue that they could raise lease prices for oil and gas operations, bringing in enough revenue to cover the state’s management costs.
“The policy of the state is to keep these lands open and available to the public,” Speaker Mike Schultz, a Republican, told Stateline last month.
O’Dea pointed to an economic analysis of what it would cost Montana to take over federal lands. The report found it would cost the state $8 billion over 20 years to take on wildfire management, deferred maintenance and mine reclamation. He noted that many Western states have sold off a majority of the “trust lands” they were granted at statehood, undermining claims that a state takeover would leave lands in the public domain.
Other proposals
While Lee’s land sales proposal has gotten the biggest headlines, public land advocates are fighting a multifront battle against the Trump administration’s moves to roll back the protected status of certain lands, slash environmental rules, and expand logging, mining and drilling operations.
“The approach is to throw as much as you can at the wall and see what sticks,” O’Dea said. “There’s only so much you can mobilize opposition to. There’s a huge risk that some of these things could fly under the radar.”
Some conservative states and industry groups say Trump is allowing federal lands to be used to their full economic potential. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said his constituents are “keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities.”
Leshy noted that public lands have proven to be a popular cause, but Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce could undermine public confidence that the federal government is capable of managing the land.
“if you make it terrible for long enough, maybe people say, ‘The feds shouldn’t be managing this, they do such a bad job,’” he said.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Administration guidance around a lesser-known 1980s-era federal law regarding emergency abortion care has been rescinded by President Donald Trump’s administration, and could impact emergency room patients in Ohio.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted in 1986, with the aim to give peace of mind to patients entering emergency departments by making it law that patients must be treated and stabilized, or transferred to a hospital that can, regardless of income or insurance level. Hospitals risk Medicare and Medicaid funding if they don’t follow the law.
  Ohio hospitals 
The assurances held in the act include abortion services and care in the event of an emergency, which is why, when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, guidance was released by the U.S. Health and Human Services leader on how to continue under the federal law.
The letter from former Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized the protections in the act around “clinical judgment” and the the legal duty for physicians or other providers to “provide stabilizing medical treatment” to an emergency room patient above any “directly conflicting” state law.
“Thus, if a physician believes that a pregnant patient presenting at an emergency department, including certain labor and delivery departments, is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment,” Becerra wrote.
Earlier this month, however, the Trump administration rescinded the guidance, along with Becerra’s letter explaining it, saying the documents “do not reflect the policy of this administration.”
A statement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said the federal law would still be enforced, despite the removal of guidance.
But Jessie Hill, professor and director of the Reproductive Rights Law Initiative at Case Western Reserve University, said the action by the Trump administration will have impacts in states were abortion isn’t legal or is more restricted, and it “creates confusion for physicians who want to provide abortions in emergency situations because it’s not longer clear whether EMTALA permits that.”
“That said, even in states like Ohio where abortion is protected, it could have some effect,” Hill said. “In particular some hospitals – especially Catholic hospitals – will decline to provide emergency abortions except in the most extreme circumstances. This would be forbidden by the prior administration’s interpretation of EMTALA, but may be permitted by the current one.”
Local hospitals contacted by the Capital Journal said they are adhering to laws and providing care accordingly. Ohio also has a constitutional amendment that includes abortion care as one of the rights held in the state’s founding document.
“In terms of EMTALA, our legal landscape has been stable in Ohio,” a spokesperson for University Hospitals said. “Our approach at University Hospitals has not changed, and we provide appropriate clinical care.”
OhioHealth representatives said the system “will continue to offer care to our patients within the confines of any new regulatory landscape and always within the best practice standards of care.”
“If termination is medically necessary, OhioHealth health care professionals will take all measures to ensure the safety of the mother’s life, baby’s life or both,” a statement read.
The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center said it follows both state and federal laws, noting state law that restricts “abortions done in state institutions to those that are necessary for life-threatening maternal health conditions and pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest, which have been reported to police,” according to spokesperson Marti Leitch.
A request for comment from Mount Carmel Health System was not returned as of Thursday.
  ‘Real-life effect’ 
The federal law further entered the national conversation via an Idaho court case that ended up rising to the U.S. Supreme Court last year.
U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear Idaho case on emergency room abortions

The nation’s highest court, however, didn’t rule on the merits of the federal law, instead sending the case back to a lower court for further litigation. Because of that, a lower court ruling was allowed to continue, temporarily allowing abortions in emergency situations.
But it was the story of Ohioan Brittany Watts’ treatment that spurred U.S. House Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, to fight to reinforce the rights under EMTALA.
“What was important for me was to highlight the real-life effect of what happens when there is confusion and uncertainty around the law,” Sykes told the Capital Journal, “that this does not become commonplace where women are seeking health care thinking they can’t receive it.”
Watts was criminally charged after suffering a miscarriage at home, accused of abuse of a corpse. Watts had gone to St. Joseph Warren Hospital and was diagnosed with a condition that “endangered her pregnancy.” But after waiting for hours, she left and came back the next day. She waited several more hours, then returned home, where the miscarriage occurred, according to her attorneys.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A grand jury declined to return an indictment, and Watts has since sued the city of Warren, law enforcement officers and the hospital, claiming constitutional violations and violations of EMTALA.
The resolution introduced by Sykes and New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill looks to “reaffirm” that the emergency medical law protects access to emergency abortion care in every state.
Sykes acknowledged the uphill battle her resolution faces toward passage with Republican majority in the U.S. House and “a pretty dysfunctional Congress that does not particularly lend itself to the health care of women and the health care of people.”
In the language of the resolution, the sponsors say bans and restrictions on reproductive health care “put the health and lives of pregnant people at risk.”
They say state laws with bans or restrictions in emergency circumstances that “force medical providers to decide between withholding necessary, stabilizing medical care from a patient experiencing a medical emergency or face criminal prosecution” also risk the health of pregnant individuals.
Sykes said the importance of upholding the federal law is even more important now, with a budget reconciliation bill that could reduce Medicaid funding and Affordable Care Act subsidies, causing the loss of health insurance for “millions of people” and forcing hospitals to have to deal with uncompensated care, according to Sykes.
“If this program is cut in the way Republicans want … I am concerned about the ripple effects of what happens to all of the people in this country and their ability to pay … when they show up in the emergency department,” Sykes said.
Right now, the discussion is about emergency abortion care, but in the future, it could be car accidents or heart attacks, Sykes argued.
The concern about access and confusion on available care is shared by reproductive health advocates and researchers who say EMTALA not only helps patients, but also the physicians who are just trying to do their jobs.
“In places where we are seeing contestations and the creation of exceptions for EMTALA, that’s going to be a distraction for clinicians if they have to stop and check if the legal status is at odds with the standards that are laid out in the care,” said Danielle Bessett, a professor at the University of Cincinnati and co-principal investigator at the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, which focuses on abortion and contraception policies.
While abortion-related visits are generally uncommon, with research showing post-abortion ER visits are typically “for reassurance,” Bessett said the information individuals receive should be dependably accurate and complete.
Confusion of any kind when it comes to health care, particularly when it comes to emergency situations will be “to the detriment of our societal health,” and that includes confusion among lawmakers making policies with direct impact in the sector, according to Bessett.
“It really goes back to the post-Dobbs restrictions that we’ve seen,” she said, referring to legislation in states after the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. “They have an impact that goes beyond what lawmakers expected, because abortion is part of routine health care.”

(Getty Images)Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

“I am a doctor. I’m definitely not a politician, but I have been a lifelong public servant,” Acton said last week during a forum at the City Club of Cleveland.
“I’m running for governor because people in Ohio are struggling, and we continue to go backwards on nearly every measure because of special interests and bad actors at our Statehouse who keep taking us in the wrong direction,” she said. “It is time for a change, and I hear this everywhere I go.”
Acton gave a 30 minute speech which included talking about experiencing homelessness as a child, serving as the ODH director during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ohio’s need for change, and kindness. 
“All too often, kindness is mistaken for weakness, and that is a big mistake,” she said. “Everywhere I go, people are telling me that they want public servants again. They want us solving the problems of everyday life that we all face that aren’t political.” 
Those problems, she said, include the cost of living, aging in place, child care, safety, and schools. She also spoke out against gerrymandering, lack of maternity units in hospitals, and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. She also highlighted the importance of working together to tackle issues facing Ohioans. 
“You get people from every sector around the table because the wicked hard things we face, like housing affordability, can’t be solved by one area alone,” she said. “It can’t be solved by government alone. It takes non-profits and academics and universities and businesses all around the table trying to row in the same direction.” 
Acton, who is open about the struggles she experienced as a child, grew up in Youngstown. 
“I had a very, very rough childhood, very bad abuse and neglect up to the age of 12 (and) ultimately ended up homeless in the middle of winter,” she said.  
COVID-19 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Acton to be ODH director in 2019 and she quickly became a household name in Ohio during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. She accompanied DeWine during his daily afternoon press conferences in the spring of 2020 and helped translate complex medical terminology into plain English.  
“It was a profound honor to lead during COVID,” she said. “We literally flatten the curve. There’s great data now that shows it, and Ohioans rallied in every possible way. We saved a lot of lives, but most importantly, we’re also able to open earlier than a lot of places and get back to our lives because we took decisive action.” 
She received a mix of praise and criticism, and protesters showed up to her Bexley house. Acton resigned as state health director in June 2020 — months after Ohio’s first confirmed COVID-19 case. 
She said she didn’t step down because of the backlash she was receiving, but instead it was because she refused to sign an order.
“There was an order that was so egregious I could not do it … because it would have broken the Hippocratic Oath, it would have hurt people,” she said. “I could not sign my name to that order.” 
Acton said she was originally approached to run for office by two prominent Ohio Democrats — former Ohio Gov. Dick Celeste and former U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, “because I have a very strange constituency that does not know party, a bond formed during COVID.”  
Ohio Governor Race
Democrats are waiting to see if Brown will run for Senate or Ohio governor, or nothing at all. Currently, gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe, of Columbus, is the only announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026. 
The Ohio Republican Party endorsed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill is the only other GOP candidate running for governor, but Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel previously said he is considering running. 
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026. 
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.

But its safety-net cuts will cost Ohio and other states far more than it will save, according to a report published last week.
The deep cuts to health care under Medicaid, and to food support under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, wouldn’t only harm the most vulnerable, the report by the Commonwealth Fund and George Washington University says. It also would wipe out jobs, stifle state economies and diminish the tax revenue that state and local governments need to operate. 
The bill, which faces a Republican self-imposed July 4 deadline for passage, stands to destroy 1.2 million jobs in the United States by 2029 and shrink state economies by $154 billion, the analysis says. 
Proposed SNAP changes could swamp Ohio’s overburdened system

Some Ohio leaders have said that the changes proposed for SNAP would overwhelm an already overburdened system and increase hunger among children, the elderly, the disabled and the working poor. They say the Medicaid cuts would cost 770,000 mostly working Ohioans their health coverage.
The Commonwealth Foundation-George Washington University report says the bill’s blast radius is far wider than that.
Ohio would lose $4.5 billion in federal funding, it says. The state’s GDP, or economic output, would drop by $5.2 billion. State and local tax revenues would drop by $3.66 billion by 2029 as well, it said.
Ohio job losses, roughly half of them in the health sector, would be 44,700, or 0.8% of the workforce, it added.
Trump and congressional Republicans are justifying the cuts because they would shrink federal spending on Medicaid and SNAP by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. But that doesn’t take into account the direct and indirect harm that would be done to the broader economy.

“Our study reveals another, less discussed consequence of the budget cutbacks: the damage to state economies and loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, amounts that greatly exceed any federal savings,” the Commonwealth Fund-George Washington University report says. “More than a million people will lose their jobs, particularly in the health care sector. Hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes will close, many of them in rural and low-income communities. The need to compensate for the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding will mean that state and local governments will have to consider cuts in other public services, such as education or infrastructure, just as they lose billions of dollars in state and local tax revenue because of the economic dislocation these policies cause.”
Meanwhile, the economic justification for Trump’s proposed tax cuts is dubious. 
They’re titled heavily in favor of the richest Americans. Of the $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
The Commonwealth Fund-George Washington University analysis said that the cuts under the Republican bill would suck money out of the pockets of poor families while it stuffs it into those of the rich — and as it plunges all of us deeper into debt.
“By cutting safety-net programs, the House budget bill reduces resources for low-income households (the lowest 10% of earners) by an average of $1,600,” it said. “At the same time, the bill’s tax cuts increase resources for high-income households (the highest 10% of earners) by $12,000. Despite the spending cuts, the bill would increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion, including about $500 billion in higher interest costs.”
Tax cuts for the wealthy have long been sold on promises that they’ll juice the economy and everybody will benefit. But there’s little evidence to support that. 
For example, the Trump tax cuts of 2017 weren’t even half the size of those contemplated under The One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Even so, they added $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the deficit, the Tax Policy Center estimates.
Trump claimed the corporate tax cuts that were part of the package would add $4,000 to median household income. But it was found to add nothing at all for families making $114,000 a year or less, while it led to vast increases in executive salaries, the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities reported.

(Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)On Saturday, June 7, I walked through South Park in Lawrence with my husband. We were browsing booths set up to for the annual LGBTQ+ pride celebration.
There had been a parade to start the day’s festivities, a parade we didn’t attend because it was pouring rain. But the skies soon cleared, and despite swampy patches in the grass and puddles on the concrete, the pride persisted. Hundreds of people circulated through the park, wearing an array of rainbow garb and chatting among themselves. A stage set up in the street played queer-themed hits such as Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club.”
The crowd was a portrait of diversity — old people, young people, middle-aged people, of all colors and races, of different levels of physical ability. I saw parents with children, couples, extended families and individuals, all part of a giant toast to equality. As we browsed among the crowd, I couldn’t help but think how different this was from current narratives about gay rights.

“How the Gay Rights Movement Radicalized, and Lost Its Way,” New York Times, June 26.
“Supreme Court OKs Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for kids, a setback for transgender rights,” Associated Press, June 18.
“Hegseth directs renaming of Navy ship honoring LGBT icon Harvey Milk,” Washington Post, June 27

Headlines paint a movement on the retreat. But I didn’t see that in Lawrence. Instead, a saw a movement growing up, expanding its reach and readying itself for battles ahead.

I won’t deny that I wiped aside a few tears.
Liberty and justice for all might go in and out of fashion. But equality remains essential if you care about other human beings in both Kansas and the entire United States. So many people had dedicated their lifetimes to getting where we were that June 7. And many more will dedicate their lifetimes to making sure that we go on celebrating, no matter what.

What’s practical
In general, I believe that politics and policy should engage more with the practical and possible than the idealistic.
If two sides appear irreparably divided, participants should figure out what small things they agree on, rather then focusing on their most yawning divides.
For the overwhelming majority of public policy issues, this makes good sense. If your opponents want a lower tax rate, and you want taxes at a higher rate, you can you can compromise on a tax rate somewhere in the middle. If you want government to spend more on one kind of service and your opponents want it to spend less, you set spending in between those proposals.
We’ve watched Republican senators engage in just this kind of horse trading on President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” over the weekend. When people say that lawmakers should work together, they usually mean something like this. Find compromise. Move forward.
But when it comes to equality, this approach becomes much more difficult.
There’s no middle ground between saying that one group of people has the same rights as you and saying that they don’t have those rights and should be ashamed of asking. Compromising on full equality means denying it. You can’t be partly equal, or as the shameful U.S. Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson put it, separate but equal.
Compromise can still improve the lives of marginalized groups. Half measures can increase the range of rights and privileges enjoyed by one kind of people or another. For instance, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — or DACA — transformed the lives of immigrants brought into the United States as children. It did not grant them full citizenship, but the program didn’t harm them.
Still, compromise can grate on the march toward full equality. Civil unions did not last long as a compromise measure for same-sex couples. Both they and many straight people decided that expanding the definition of marriage to include gay people actually strengthened the institution. It was, and remains, win-win.
As the headlines above suggest, the LGBTQ+ community has recently experienced backlash. I had hoped that we might avoid this, but oppressors don’t like to see their carefully assembled basket of privileges overturned. They will fight wildly to retain their imagined superiority.
But it is only imagined.
No amount of racist rhetoric, homophobic grumbling or ultraconservative legislatures can change the fact that discrimination is wrong. Treating people differently because of innate traits cannot be defended. It will always be wrong. And those who seek to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people or Black people or Jewish people or people of color or any other group you care to name will always be mistaken. They will find themselves on the ash heap of history.

Pushing forward
This basic moral truth is why social movements continue.
This is why gay people and their allies flood the streets for pride marches — not just in Lawrence but also in Budapest, Hungary. This is why Black people and their friends and supporters mark Juneteenth. Those of us who know what it’s like to face institutionalized legal discrimination do not forget.
I am perfectly capable of holding a polite conversation with someone who believes that I am less than a full human being. But I know the harms their beliefs have caused. I will still judge them.
Those on the far right like to accuse anyone to their left of moral relativism. Yet I cannot imagine a more morally objective, idealistic goal than full legal equality for all people. When it comes to individual rights, when it comes to the freedom of people to be who they truly are, we can share a noble goal.
As a gay man, I’ve been stunned to see how far America has moved during my lifetime. I now live with my husband and son in a state where being gay was actually illegal.
I have no illusions. The job’s not done, will probably never be done. We still have much ground to cover in gaining basic legal rights for LGBTQ+ people. 
Yet as we walked through that sodden-yet-heartening event in early June, I chose to focus on the positive for a few minutes. LGBTQ+ people will not give up, cannot give up, because this is who we are. These are our lives, and we are just as worthy, just as American, just as human, as anyone else. Happy pride to all.

Over the past decade, health insurance companies have increasingly embraced the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. Unlike doctors and hospitals, which use AI to help diagnose and treat patients, health insurers use these algorithms to decide whether to pay for health care treatments and services that are recommended by a given patient’s physicians.
One of the most common examples is prior authorization, which is when your doctor needs to
receive payment approval from your insurance company before providing you care. Many insurers use an algorithm to decide whether the requested care is “medically necessary” and should be covered.
These AI systems also help insurers decide how much care a patient is entitled to — for example, how many days of hospital care a patient can receive after surgery.
If an insurer declines to pay for a treatment your doctor recommends, you usually have three options. You can try to appeal the decision, but that process can take a lot of time, money and expert help. Only 1 in 500 claim denials are appealed. You can agree to a different treatment that your insurer will cover. Or you can pay for the recommended treatment yourself, which is often not realistic because of high health care costs.
As a legal scholar who studies health law and policy, I’m concerned about how insurance algorithms affect people’s health. Like with AI algorithms used by doctors and hospitals, these tools can potentially improve care and reduce costs. Insurers say that AI helps them make quick, safe decisions about what care is necessary and avoids wasteful or harmful treatments.
But there’s strong evidence that the opposite can be true. These systems are sometimes used to delay or deny care that should be covered, all in the name of saving money.
 A pattern of withholding care

Presumably, companies feed a patient’s health care records and other relevant information into health care coverage algorithms and compare that information with current medical standards of care to decide whether to cover the patient’s claim. However, insurers have refused to disclose how these algorithms work in making such decisions, so it is impossible to say exactly how they operate in practice.
Using AI to review coverage saves insurers time and resources, especially because it means fewer medical professionals are needed to review each case. But the financial benefit to insurers doesn’t stop there. If an AI system quickly denies a valid claim, and the patient appeals, that appeal process can take years. If the patient is seriously ill and expected to die soon, the insurance company might save money simply by dragging out the process in the hope that the patient dies before the case is resolved.
This creates the disturbing possibility that insurers might use algorithms to withhold care for expensive, long-term or terminal health problems , such as chronic or other debilitating disabilities. One reporter put it bluntly: “Many older adults who spent their lives paying into Medicare now face amputation or cancer and are forced to either pay for care themselves or go without.”
Research supports this concern – patients with chronic illnesses are more likely to be denied coverage and suffer as a result. In addition, Black and Hispanic people and those of other nonwhite ethnicities, as well as people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, are more likely to experience claims denials. Some evidence also suggests that prior authorization may increase rather than decrease health care system costs.
Insurers argue that patients can always pay for any treatment themselves, so they’re not really being denied care. But this argument ignores reality. These decisions have serious health consequences, especially when people can’t afford the care they need.
 Moving toward regulation

Unlike medical algorithms, insurance AI tools are largely unregulated. They don’t have to go through Food and Drug Administration review, and insurance companies often say their algorithms are trade secrets.
That means there’s no public information about how these tools make decisions, and there’s no outside testing to see whether they’re safe, fair or effective. No peer-reviewed studies exist to show how well they actually work in the real world.
There does seem to be some momentum for change. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which is the federal agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, recently announced that insurers in Medicare Advantage plans must base decisions on the needs of individual patients – not just on generic criteria. But these rules still let insurers create their own decision-making standards, and they still don’t require any outside testing to prove their systems work before using them. Plus, federal rules can only regulate federal public health programs like Medicare. They do not apply to private insurers who do not provide federal health program coverage.
Some states, including Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Maine and Texas, have proposed laws to rein in insurance AI. A few have passed new laws, including a 2024 California statute that requires a licensed physician to supervise the use of insurance coverage algorithms.
But most state laws suffer from the same weaknesses as the new CMS rule. They leave too much control in the hands of insurers to decide how to define “medical necessity” and in what contexts to use algorithms for coverage decisions. They also don’t require those algorithms to be reviewed by neutral experts before use. And even strong state laws wouldn’t be enough, because states generally can’t regulate Medicare or insurers that operate outside their borders.
 A role for the FDA

In the view of many health law experts, the gap between insurers’ actions and patient needs has become so wide that regulating health care coverage algorithms is now imperative. As I argue in an essay to be published in the Indiana Law Journal, the FDA is well positioned to do so.
The FDA is staffed with medical experts who have the capability to evaluate insurance algorithms before they are used to make coverage decisions. The agency already reviews many medical AI tools for safety and effectiveness. FDA oversight would also provide a uniform, national regulatory scheme instead of a patchwork of rules across the country.
Some people argue that the FDA’s power here is limited. For the purposes of FDA regulation, a medical device is defined as an instrument “intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.” Because health insurance algorithms are not used to diagnose, treat or prevent disease, Congress may need to amend the definition of a medical device before the FDA can regulate those algorithms.
If the FDA’s current authority isn’t enough to cover insurance algorithms, Congress could change the law to give it that power. Meanwhile, CMS and state governments could require independent testing of these algorithms for safety, accuracy and fairness. That might also push insurers to support a single national standard – like FDA regulation – instead of facing a patchwork of rules across the country.
The move toward regulating how health insurers use AI in determining coverage has clearly begun, but it is still awaiting a robust push. Patients’ lives are literally on the line.

About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings. The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “common-sense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year. South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law earlier this year when it passed the state budget. The bathroom policy became law last year when it was inserted into part of the state budget, which must be renewed each year.
The Arizona legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)As the recent stench of war grew stronger, I noticed once again how much we love our machines, be they bunker-busting or surgical, life-saving or high-earning, analog, digital or artificially intelligent. But what happens when our doodads and thingamajigs act human … you know … err?
To wit: Last week in this space, the modern marvel autocorrect changed one letter in one word (“defund” to “defend”) in one sentence, in one paragraph of an entire 750-word commentary. The “correction” altered the entire meaning of the piece. But those were simply the details.
More pressing appears to be that we’re moving from machines being able to help us express our thoughts and ideas to machines making them for us — intentional or not. All in the name of technological progress. 
Common wizardry
Such wizardry as autocorrect, ChatGPT or any of a number of AI tools is commonplace today, whether to construct a good declarative sentence or to plan and execute a bombing mission 7,000 miles away. I’m only speculating on the latter, but surely AI played some role when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Perhaps AI will also be used to resolve with accuracy the debate between “obliterate” and “two months,” a chasm both linguistic and political.
We can stop already with that annoying longing for the good old days. The AI genie is long out of the bottle and is not going back in. While government, business, medicine, manufacturing, agriculture and science race to capitalize on its wonders — which are legion and spectacular — we should also know and embrace its limitations. 
Please don’t confuse me with the Luddite down the block. I have for some time embraced technology, even making peace as a former professor of academic writing with the untimely death of the college essay at the impressive hands of large language learning models such as the aforementioned ChatGPT. 
You remember ChatGPT: Feed some information into it, such as “Write 600 words making the case for slavery reparations.” Click once and within 30 seconds, you have yourself a serviceable essay, probably in the realm of “Cs get degrees.” A second try might ask it to provide two citations. Which it will. (C+?) Try it. Perhaps you’ll want to retake Comp 101 from freshman year.
But, as I’ve written before, what is missing in these essays is a sense of humanity, not simply in language but also in tone, word choice and if you will, a measure of the writer’s passion for the subject — none of which, to date, ChatGPT can provide. A productive bot may be many things. A moral being is not one of them.
Our health can be affected, too. A critical reading of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” uncovered serious flaws, including citations of research that did not exist. Whether or not AI was used to generate the report remains unclear. This much is clear: It makes little difference whether it was the bots or the humans. The information was wrong. 
Often right
AI gets it right most of the time. The question we have to ask ourselves is whether most of the time is good enough. Is it better than a human most of the time? Worse? I’m intolerant of one incorrect word out of 750. What would be our tolerance level in war, surgery, a banking transaction or an immigration hearing?
These AI problems, called hallucinations, have led to PR disasters for American businesses from McDonald’s to Sports Illustrated to Amazon. Mickey D’s had to scuttle its foray into AI ordering when a video of the AI “crew member” ringing up an order of 260 Chicken McNuggets after the customers had begged it to stop went viral. SI somehow gave bylines to AI-generated authors, and Amazon was hyping a recruitment tool that somehow only recruited men.
Pardon my cherry picking. Regular readers here know that of all the modern barriers between us and a better future, access to the truth is paramount. AI can be a powerful force in that kit of democracy’s tools. AI and someone accountable for it.
Had last week’s autocorrect snafu gone unedited, the republic would have survived. But as we edge forward (or backward) with cease fires and bombings and the potential for a wider war, we should ensure all the AI and technological wizardry we have at our disposal has a capable human — a moral agent — attached.
To read more about AI and hallucinations, Google them. An AI bot will tell you all you need to know.
