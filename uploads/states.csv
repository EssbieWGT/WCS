Kentucky Lantern reporter Liam Niemeyer was honored this week for his reporting on dam safety in Kentucky.
The Association of State Dam Safety Officials at its national conference in Cleveland on Monday awarded Niemeyer its Media Outreach award for his “deep dive” look at the “funding and enforcement challenges that are resulting in dozens of high-hazard potential dams in poor or unsatisfactory conditions.” The organization called it “a case study on dam safety reporting at the state level.” 
Dozens of dams in Kentucky are in poor shape or worse. They won’t be cheap to fix.

Niemeyer’s reporting highlighted the deteriorating condition of dozens of hazardous dams across Kentucky, a growing infrastructure challenge that could potentially cost billions of dollars to fix. His reporting also detailed the challenges with finding and holding accountable dam owners responsible for the worsening infrastructure.
Kentucky Lantern editor Jamie Lucke said, “Liam used the Kentucky Open Records Act to locate dams — 71 of them across Kentucky — that are in poor condition and also in places where leaks or failures would harm people or property. Liam also interviewed government officials, including two mayors on opposite ends of the state, to better convey the challenges of putting together funding and plans to make needed repairs. It’s gratifying that our public service journalism is being recognized by experts in dam safety.”
The Association of State Dam Safety Officials, headquartered in Lexington, represents a range of professionals focused on dam safety including state and federal regulators, engineers, dam owners and operators and more. The organization established the Media Outreach award for journalists in 2017 to recognize reporting that enhances “the public understanding of the impact dams have on society” among other notable contributions on dam safety. 
The organization this week also recognized with a Media Outreach award the work of two Bloomberg reporters who highlighted the impacts of climate change on dam infrastructure across the country. According to the association, previous recipients of the Media Outreach award include The State newspaper in South Carolina and the Associated Press.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3-1024x791.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

(Getty Images)The ugly specter of mid-term gerrymandering may be rearing its head in Kentucky, and the potential disruption to our state’s federal representation is impossible to overstate. 
It started in Texas when President Donald Trump urged lawmakers there to redraw their congressional district boundaries in order to create more Republican seats and help protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Predictably, Texas Republicans, supported by Trump acolyte Gov. Greg Abbott, complied. In response, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has initiated a process designed to do the same thing in his state, which could balance any Republican gains in Texas. 
Historically, redistricting is done every 10 years following the decennial census. This makes sense because House seats are allocated based on population, which can change significantly over 10 years. 
It is highly unusual for states to redraw district lines between censuses unless they are ordered to do so by the courts. In fact, since 1970, only Texas (twice) and Georgia have redistricted for partisan advantage. But now a redistricting battle is underway, and every state with one-party control and seats held by the minority party is under pressure to enter the fray. Kentucky is in that category. 
My former seat, Kentucky’s 3rd Congressional District, the one now occupied by Morgan McGarvey, is one of the most “logical” districts anywhere. It currently includes all but roughly 20,000 people who live in Louisville Metro, and none outside the city lines. There is no confusion as to what member of Congress represents the interests of the Louisville community, including, for example, the University of Louisville. The mayor and the U.S. representative for the 3rd District have essentially the same constituencies, making coordination of multi-governmental efforts very effective and efficient. 
Now there is discussion among some Republicans in Frankfort about splitting the Louisville community into three different congressional districts, presumably making it almost impossible, in the current environment, for a Democrat to be elected. This strategy was discussed briefly after the 2020 census, but the five Republican members of the Kentucky House delegation, along with Sen. Mitch McConnell, convinced Republicans in the General Assembly that it was a bad idea.
Under the concept under discussion back then, for example, a portion of Louisville would have become part of a district that extended south to the Tennessee border. Understandably, the Republican members of the federal delegation were happy with their “safe” districts and didn’t want a bunch of Louisville Democratic voters in their jurisdictions.
I don’t believe McConnell ever made any public comments about the idea, but I’m sure he understood the political risk of doing something so damaging to his hometown, and also the University of Louisville, to which he has always been fiercely loyal. 
Now the idea apparently has resurfaced, as some Republican members of the Kentucky legislature somehow think they haven’t done enough to disenfranchise many Kentuckians, especially Louisvillians. 
Wiser heads must prevail. Tennessee offers a vivid lesson as to the damage such a move would do. Legislators there split Nashville into three districts during their decennial process. Now the state’s capital has three people representing it in the U.S. House, and this is one case in which more is not better. 
The math is simple. Each congressional district across the country includes roughly 750,000 people. If you divide a district by three, that means in Nashville, 250,000 people are placed in a new district with 500,000 other Tennesseans, most of whom have little in common with them. If you are their representative, whose interests will have your priority? Clearly it is the 500,000, who will most likely have given you your victory margin. 
Right now, Nashville has a Democratic mayor. He must work with three Republican representatives on any federal initiative. I recently spoke with a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who outlined the problems with such a setup. Vanderbilt, for example, has had to reorient its government relations efforts to deal with multiple Washington offices rather than one. I won’t go into all the problems caused in Nashville by this strategy, but suffice to say, Nashville has not benefitted from the redistricting, and neither has anyone else in Tennessee, except Republican candidates.
Missouri is about to do the same thing to Kansas City, breaking up its largest city and economic engine for strictly partisan electoral advantage, and in that case, essentially disenfranchising a large Black population from federal representation. 
Hopefully, this idea will be nipped in the bud. No one should want the University of Louisville to have three representatives, none of whom would consider that institution a priority if they also represented Western Kentucky University or Morehead. It’s true that Louisville’s critical airport has only one representative, but how much interest would someone have in that critical facility if they also represented Bowling Green or Owensboro? Similar examples are numerous. 
Louisville has never had a Black representative in Congress, but Black voters have a decisive impact on who represents them in Congress. That would not be the case if the district is sliced apart. It is a certainty that such a plan would be challenged in court on racial discrimination grounds.
Most Americans don’t like gerrymandering, which serves nothing but partisan electoral ambitions. They believe, as I do, that voters should choose their politicians; politicians should not choose their voters. I am less and less optimistic that today’s Kentucky Republican officials will consider the public interest, but hope springs eternal.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1094078594-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

Driven by “a lineup of disgraceful racial bigots and American fascists,” a divisive political crusade by conservatives in the United States was “like a gigantic, tumultuous hurricane” that “dominated the thoughts and actions of the American people, disrupting their emotions, distorting their judgment ….” Those are the words of Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter, a member of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who, in his 1965 book “Days of Shame,” repudiated the excesses of the McCarthy era.
I read Potter’s 60-year-old mea culpa in David Maraniss’s powerful personal history, “A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father,” (Simon & Schuster 2019), which traces the Maraniss family’s harrowing journey to Madison, Wisconsin. The anti-McCarthy Capital Times newspaper saved Maraniss’s dad, Elliott, giving him a job after he was blacklisted and then followed from town to town by federal agents investigating his political activities over “five years, five cities, four kids, eight homes, two papers that fired him, three papers that folded,” as Maraniss writes.
I binge-read the book amid a storm of news as the administration of President Donald Trump ramped up attacks on leftwing activists, Democrats, progressive nonprofits and the media, blaming them for the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, and vowing to attack what White House adviser Stephen Miller called a “vast domestic terror movement,” using the full force of the federal government to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks.”

I reached out to Maraniss Thursday in Madison, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author grew up and still spends summers. ABC had just indefinitely suspended late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel for criticizing the MAGA movement’s weaponization of the Kirk shooting. And Trump and his FCC chairman were threatening to yank broadcasting licenses from media outlets that criticize the president.
I wanted to ask Maraniss about the parallels he sees between the time he describes so vividly in his book and the current moment.
“There are several obvious haunting similarities,” he told me on the phone, “the demonization of others, the calling of all opponents Marxist or communists or enemies of the state, the gross manipulation of truth, the use of fear to stifle dissent and pressure to silence the media or get the press to go along.”
“Back then,” he added, “most of the press did go along with McCarthy for a long time.”
The Capital Times stood out as an early critic of Wisconsin’s bombastic Red-hunting senator, Joseph McCarthy. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson was another prominent anti-McCarthy voice, along with Murrey Marder of the Washington Post and Edward R. Murrow — all mentioned in Maraniss’s book. “But you could cite many more that were going along with McCarthyism.”
The main difference Maraniss sees between the McCarthy era and today is that “McCarthy was only a senator, and now we’re dealing with the president, with full control of the levers of power which McCarthy did not have, ranging from the Justice Department to the military.”
McCarthy took aim at major U.S. institutions — from government agencies to  universities to Hollywood to mainline Protestant churches — but he overstepped when began attacking the U.S. Army, infuriating then-President Dwight Eisenhower.
Another glaring difference between then and now, Maraniss added, “is that McCarthy did not have the full support of his own party, the Republican Party.” Today, “almost any Republican who opposed Trump is now no longer in office or in the party.”
It took a long time, however, for mainstream media and mainstream Republicans to turn against McCarthyism and for the public to swing from the distorted thinking former HUAC member Potter finally repudiated to the consensus that leftwing political ideology did not, in fact, pose an existential threat to U.S. national security.
Among the many echoes of Red Scare fever resonating through national politics today is the central issue of race. One of the most gripping scenes in Maraniss’s book is future Detroit Mayor Coleman Young’s testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the Federal Building in Detroit. Young, a World War II veteran, confronts the southern racists on the committee as they question his loyalty, repeatedly correcting their slurring pronunciation of the world “Negro.” Despite the committee’s high-handedness and multiple attempts to silence him, Young has the last word.
“I fought in the last war and I would unhesitatingly take up arms against anybody that attacks this country,” he says. “In the same manner, I am now in the process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynchings and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don’t think I must apologize or explain it to anybody, my position on that.”
Reading about Young and the other brave souls who stood up to McCarthyism, including the elder Maraniss’s lawyer, George Crockett, who was jailed for contempt and returned to continue fighting, is inspiring and thrilling.
In contrast, Maraniss traces the sordid history of U.S. Rep. John Stephens Wood, a Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claimed he only went to one meeting). He lays out the evidence that Wood attended the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish industrialist who was accused of killing of a young, female factory worker in Georgia. Wood was the “wheelman” for Judge Newt Morris, his mentor, helping to collect the body from the lynchers and drive it to the morgue.
White racists, as Potter later acknowledged, played a prominent role in the McCarthy era purges of “un-American” activists. These were the people who sat in judgment of civil rights leaders, Black unionists and activists for racial equality. Maraniss’s father, an antifascist who joined the Communist Party when he was in college at the University of Michigan, led an all-Black battalion in World War II, and dedicated his life to his idealistic view of America, was the target of people who had little respect for equal rights or the Constitution.
Who are the real patriots, Maraniss asks — a question that resonates today.
“Race is at the center of American life, then and now,” Maraniss said on the phone. “And what we’re facing this time is really an attempt to erase the civil rights movement.”
“The chairman of the House un American Activities Committee that went after my father was a Georgia racist who was elected in white-only primaries and opposed every civil rights measure, and he was the one defining what’s an American,” he said. “And you have a similar thing going on now where Charlie Kirk is celebrated on NFL stadium screens and people are being fired left and right, for criticizing someone who disparaged Martin Luther King.”
It’s important not to be cowed by the deliberate use of language as a weapon to promote misunderstanding, he said, “as they have with DEI. I mean, what is on its face wrong with diversity, equity and inclusion, you know? Think about it. I mean, the same thing with being antifascist. I mean, people should embrace those ideas and not run away from them.”
Of his parents, Maraniss writes: “They never betrayed America and loved it no less than the officials who rendered judgment on them in Room 740 of the Federal Building in Detroit. They were dissenters who believed the nation had not lived up to its founding ideals in terms of race and equality, largely because of the reactionary attitudes of self-righteous attackers on the American right.”
The book ends happily. The Maraniss family arrived in Wisconsin in time to watch the Milwaukee Braves play their way to a pennant and eventually beat the Yankees in the World Series. “McCarthy was dead. The Supreme Court had essentially overturned the Smith Act, ruling it was unconstitutional to bring charges against American citizens solely because of their political advocacy. … The world was opening anew.”
But there is, of course, no real end to the struggle. In an epilogue, Maraniss writes about Cap Times reporter John Patrick Hunter, who, long after the Red Scare was safely over,  typed up sections of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, combined it with a petition listing six of the 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights, along with the Fifteenth Amendment granting Black men the right to vote, then roamed a local park in Madison trying to collect signatures. “He gave the people the nation’s foundational truth and it did not go well,” Maraniss writes. “Of the 112 people he asked to sign the petition. Only one did. Twenty accused him of being a communist.”
“It is an endless struggle,” Maraniss said on the phone. “That’s what life is. And you know, it tends to go in cycles of reaction and counter reaction. This is a very, very difficult one of those cycles. But I’ve been an optimist my whole life. It’s being challenged like never before in my life. My father endured it and came out an optimist anyway, somehow. So to honor my father, I maintain my optimism.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Three Stafford County voters are asking a judge to remove Democratic House of Delegates nominee Stacey Carroll from the ballot, arguing she doesn’t actually live in the district where she registered to vote and is running for office. 
The petition, filed in Stafford County Circuit Court, contends Carroll lives at a longtime home in House District 23 while claiming a different address in neighboring House District 64 to qualify for the race.
In the complaint brought under a Virginia statute that allows voters to object to another person’s registration, petitioners Stephen Edward Schwartz, Judith Anne Parker and Juliet McGee Schweiter allege Carroll changed her voter registration on Feb. 5, 2025, to an address on Pinkerton Court in District 64 but “continues to reside” on Bismark Drive in District 23. The latter, which includes parts of Stafford and Prince William counties, is currently represented by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William. 
The filing lists the Bismark Drive house as a property Carroll has owned and occupied since 2018. It asks the court to hear the case on an expedited basis, cancel Carroll’s District 64 registration and direct state officials to decertify her candidacy and remove her from the ballot.
The petition says the Pinkerton Court property “is owned by Jared Harmon and Crystal Harmon,” and that the Harmons still live there. 
The voters say their challenge rests on months of observation and documentary indicators they argue show Carroll never moved. 
“Carroll is physically present at 71 Bismark Drive on a consistent basis,” the petition alleges, adding that her “primary vehicle, a white 2017 Cadillac Escalade, is consistently parked” at the Bismark Drive address “for significant periods of the day and overnight.”

The filing also asserts she “continues to receive mail” at Bismark Drive, “pays the electricity bill” there, and that her certified public accountant license lists Bismark as her residence. Conversely, “Motor vehicles belonging to Carroll and her immediate family have not been observed” at the Pinkerton Court address, and the Harmons’ vehicles are regularly there, the petition says.
Under Virginia law, voters must be residents of the precinct where they vote, a concept that “requires both domicile and place of abode,” according to Article II, Section 1 of the state Constitution quoted in the suit. 
State statute similarly defines domicile as a person’s primary home requiring presence and an intent to remain, and the petition cites case law that “there must be both act and intention in order to acquire new legal residence.” The burden to show the change is on the registrant, the filing says, quoting the Supreme Court of Virginia’s Kegley v. Johnson decision in 1966.
Because the constitution also requires would-be delegates to be residents of the district they seek to represent, the petitioners argue, Carroll “is not qualified to be a delegate from House of Delegates District 64” if she is not lawfully registered there. 
The filing says notice of the petition was provided to Carroll and the state Democratic Party on Aug. 29.
Carroll, a military veteran who is challenging Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, pushed back forcefully on the lawsuit, calling it an attack not just on her but on military families more broadly. 
“The accusations about where I live are false and insulting to every veteran and military family who knows what it means to move in service to our country,” she said in an email. She added that she is “a proud resident of House District 64” and remains “committed to serving this community.” 
Carroll argued that questioning her residency was an affront to those who relocate for service, saying, “To suggest that military families don’t belong in the communities they serve dishonors that sacrifice.”
The lawsuit names as respondents Stafford County General Registrar Anna Hash, the Virginia State Board of Elections, the Department of Elections, and Carroll. The venue is proper, the petition says, because all three petitioners are Stafford County voters and Carroll “is on the registration records in Stafford County.”
Residency disputes surface periodically in Virginia, particularly after redistricting. 
In 2023, several Chesterfield County residents challenged Democratic Sen. Ghazala Hashmi’s eligibility, arguing she hadn’t met residency requirements in the newly drawn 15th Senate District. A Chesterfield judge dismissed the challenge after a hearing, and reporting at the time detailed the petitioners’ surveillance-style claims about vehicle movements and time spent at a prior family home — paralleling some of the allegations seen in the Carroll petition. 
Earlier, in 2011, voters used the same Virginia Code § 24.2-431 process to challenge the registration of House candidate David Ramadan in Loudoun County’s newly created 87th District. The court opinion and contemporaneous reporting show petitioners argued Ramadan lacked proper domicile in the district.
The legal standards the Stafford petition leans on are longstanding. In Kegley v. Johnson, the Virginia Supreme Court emphasized that a voter changing residence must pair a physical move with intent to remain, and the registrant bears the burden to prove both.
The petition here quotes that principle and also cites the State Board of Elections’ regulatory definition of “domicile” as “a person’s primary home, the place where a person dwells and which [s]he considers to be the center of h[er] domestic, social, and civil life.”
In the Stafford case, the petitioners list a dozen factual assertions they say support their claim that Bismark Drive remains Carroll’s true home — ranging from overnight parking patterns and household trash production to utility payments and mail delivery — and assert “no activity has been observed” at Bismark Drive “that is consistent with a change in residency, such as a moving truck, packing, or other similar activities.” 
At the Pinkerton address, they allege, “no activity has been observed … that is consistent with a change in residency.”
The filing also argues the petitioners have a “constitutional and statutory right to be represented in the House of Delegates by a resident” of their district and that Carroll’s alleged misregistration infringes that right. 
While each case turns on its facts, Virginia’s press and courts have noted these fights often hinge on documentary breadcrumbs and ordinary-life details that show where a candidate actually lives. 
The Mercury has previously examined how residency and redistricting rules can scramble political maps and candidacies after lines are redrawn, noting that the state’s requirement that legislators reside in the districts they represent has added “intrigue” to election cycles.
The Stafford petition does not specify a hearing date but asks for expedited consideration under the election code. If the court agrees with the petitioners, it could cancel Carroll’s registration at the Pinkerton address and order her decertified as a candidate in District 64. 
If the court finds Carroll established domicile in District 64 and abandoned the Bismark Drive domicile, the case would be dismissed — similar to how the Hashmi challenge ended in 2023.
Residency objections during election cycles are typically handled promptly given looming timelines.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)News of Pennsylvania’s budget impasse reads like sports coverage with mention of wins, losses, pitches and next moves. 
But for sexual assault survivors and the organizations that support them, the state budget isn’t a game. 
It’s a lifeline.
We each serve as the president of an agency’s board of directors, either for our local rape crisis center or their statewide coalition. A large portion of the services we provide are funded by the state; because of the impasse, our agencies are working without payment. 
But we can’t hold out much longer.
Rape crisis centers in Pa. say flat funding threatens survivor support

Across the Commonwealth, rape crisis centers annually support 27,000 people impacted by sexual violence – one-third of whom are children – with services including 24/7 crisis hotlines and forensic rape exam accompaniment, victim advocacy, and counseling. We meet victims in the darkest moments of their lives, and work with them towards healing. 
Our crucial services continue through the budget impasse because sexual assault does not pause for politics. 
Yet this puts our agencies in an unsustainable situation. How are we supposed to do our jobs without payment? 
Each day, the impasse continues causes more harm. Many centers have already had to slash benefits, furlough staff and max out lines of credit; some are considering temporarily closing if this goes on much longer.
What does that mean for our communities when rape crisis centers aren’t there to respond?  Phone calls at 3:00 a.m. from a survivor with PTSD are sent to voicemail. Victims in the ER are handed a business card instead of having an advocate at their side during a rape exam. Child survivors are put on long wait lists for therapy. 










Each day the impasse continues causes more harm. Many centers have already had to slash benefits, furlough staff and max out lines of credit; some are considering temporarily closing if this goes on much longer.


In short: victims don’t get the support they need, trauma goes untreated, and people suffer. 
We hope that this is a reminder to everyone in the commonwealth that the state budget isn’t about politics. It’s about people’s lives. 
Pennsylvania’s rape crisis centers have never stopped doing their job. Now we need our state leaders to stop playing games and do theirs.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Lake-minded New Hampshire legislators are gearing up to tackle water quality once again this session, after some measures aimed at preventing and treating cyanobacteria blooms were voted down or softened last session.
“We’ve got a really enormous problem headed at us, especially with climate change and warming waters,” said sponsor Sen. David Watters. “… I’m worried it will create this toxic stew in our lakes and along the shore.”
Watters said he had two main objectives in mind for the bill: Formalizing a strategy to address cyanobacteria blooms and other emerging water quality threats, then settling on a way to fund those efforts.
Blooms are population explosions of single-celled, toxin-producing organisms called cyanobacteria. Sometimes, they appear as surface scum or swirling green clouds, but they may also sink to the bottom of a lake or appear less dense, making them invisible to the casual observer. 
Cyanobacteria thrive in nutrient-flooded water, often the result of septic and fertilizer runoff, and in warm temperatures. Warming associated with climate change is causing them to appear more often, and though they typically occur in summer, in some New Hampshire lakes, cyanobacteria blooms are occurring year-round.
Though officials have previously downplayed the risks associated with cyanobacteria, the organisms can indeed be dangerous. The toxins cyanobacteria release can cause health concerns for people and pets who come into contact with blooms, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Reactions to cyanobacteria range from rashes and headaches to nausea, cough, and neurological symptoms, depending on exposure level and the type of bacterial toxin emitted by the bloom.  
“There is a health issue here, a potential health issue that I think we need to really address,” said bill co-sponsor Rep. Rosemarie Rung, citing research linking cyanobacteria toxin exposure to the neurodegenerative disease ALS.
For these reasons, and to safeguard the economic role New Hampshire’s lakes play in the state’s tourism economy, Rung and Watters said finding a policy path toward addressing cyanobacteria was a priority.
Previous legislative efforts regarding cyanobacteria have sought to limit them at the source by reducing the influx of nutrient-rich chemical fertilizers into New Hampshire’s water supply. Legislators showed bipartisan support for a bill restricting some fertilizers and creating guidelines prohibiting fertilizer application near storm drains when they overturned then-Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of the measure in October 2024. (However, the House later softened penalties for prohibited fertilizer application during the 2025 session.)
Once a cyanobacteria bloom emerges in a body of water, the cost required to treat it begins to climb. 
“Addressing cyanobacteria is incredibly expensive,” Rung said.
Aluminum is often used to rid lakes of the blooms, a feat it accomplishes by binding to the bacteria-nourishing element phosphorus and sinking, removing the nutrient from the water column. But on top of the fact that the treatments can endanger lakes’ broader ecosystems and aren’t considered permanent solutions by biologists, they can also carry price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The Legislature established a cyanobacteria fund several years ago to combat the blooms, Rung said, and through it disbursed about $3 million in state and American Rescue Plan Act funding for treatment of lakes around the state. But all that action depleted the fund, Rung said.
“That money’s gone,” she said. 
Watters said the high cost of treating cyanobacteria was worth it in the context of New Hampshire lakes’ function as economic engines and their cultural importance. Watters is worried the blooms will worsen, sickening people and pets and affecting fisheries and property values, he said.
Another possible funding route that Rung introduced last session, which would feed the cyanobacteria fund through sales of a “Love NH Lakes” license plate, was retained in the transportation committee.  
According to a draft version of Watters’ planned bill, the proposal would amend statute to permit the formation of village districts around the goal of addressing water quality concerns, including cyanobacteria blooms. 
Village districts allow regions across multiple municipalities or a smaller portion of a single municipality to operate as an organized body. In the context of cyanobacteria, Rung and Watters hope this would help districts coordinate efforts to control the blooms. With voter approval, the districts could also raise funds for remediation, they said.
This idea has already been raised in the Legislature in prior years by lawmakers of both parties without success. A bill sponsored by former Rep. Dan Wolf in 2024 was the first attempt at such an amendment, narrowly failing in the House, Rung recalled. Last session, Rung introduced a similar bill again — but it was controversial among conservative legislators who considered it another avenue toward “adding a new tax,” she said.
Rung disagrees with this assessment, saying the modification would principally allow lakefront property owners to organize themselves across municipality lines. A vote would be required to raise taxes within the districts, she said. 
Watters said he expected some lawmakers to categorically resist the possibility of raising taxes for any reason, including to fight cyanobacteria. But, he said, lakefront property owners may feel differently, especially if their property values and lifestyles could be affected by cyanobacteria blooms.
“The people who are part of these water districts on the lakes — they know we have to do something,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cyanobacteriabills-1024x752.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

At least nearly a dozen LifeWise Academy Ohio programs have taken public school students on field trips to the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter in Kentucky, which claims humans lived alongside dinosaurs and the Earth is only 6,000 years old.
LifeWise Academy is a controversial Hilliard-based religious instruction program for public school students on “religious release time,” that operates in 34 states and plans to enroll nearly 100,000 students this school year, according to its website.
It will also be in almost half of Ohio’s public school districts this school year.
LifeWise Academy programs in Adams County, Holgate Schools (Henry County), Continental Schools (Putnam County), Antwerp Schools (Paulding County), Wayne Trace Schools (Paulding County), Paulding Schools (Paulding County), Central Local (Defiance County), Van Wert (Van Wert County), and Tinora (part of Northeastern Schools in Defiance County) have all taken field trips to the Ark Encounter this year, in 2024 or 2023, according to Facebook posts from those LifeWise programs.

Pandora-Gilboa’s LifeWise Academy Program (Putnam County) has visited the Creation Museum every year from 2021-2025 and Upper Arlington’s LifeWise Program (Franklin County) visited the museum in 2023, according to Facebook posts from those LifeWise programs. 
The Creation Museum promotes young Earth creationism, the belief that God created the universe and everything in it in six 24-hour days 6,000 years ago. 
This comes from a literal interpretation of Genesis 1 where God created the universe. 
The museum in Petersburg, Kentucky depicts humans and dinosaurs living together and characterizes the Earth as approximately 6,000 years old. 
“LifeWise teaches Bible lessons, plain and simple,” Christine Czernejewski, a spokesperson for LifeWise, said in an email. “As such, kids are taught what Genesis 1 actually says — that God created all things and that He created them over the course of 6 different days.”
Scientists have determined Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old. 
“The science (at the Creation Museum), it’s just appalling,” said Daniel Phelps, a retired geologist based in Kentucky. 
“They depict dinosaurs and humans as living together. They have many, multiple attacks on the standard view of science, especially things like theology and biology and paleontology. … They misinterpret a lot of the human fossil record, and the Art Park especially has a display that disputes climate science.”
LifeWise Academy is a non-denominational Christian program that teaches the Bible to public school students during the school day at a special release time.
“We tend to teach the Bible kind of as it teaches,” said LifeWise Founder and CEO Joel Penton. “We do talk through the six days of creation as outlined in Genesis 1. However, developing a systematic theology of young Earth versus old Earth, we leave that to local churches.”

In January, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a law passed by Republican lawmakers that mandates public school districts create a policy allowing students release time for religious instruction.
It concerns Phelps that LifeWise programs are taking students to the museum and the ark. 
“I would like to call this educational malpractice,” Phelps said. “It simply is not science, and the students are being misled. They’re basically learning to distrust science and follow an extremely fringe version of Christianity.”
A 2019 Gallup poll showed that 40% of U.S. adults believe in creationism, the belief that God created humans in their present form within roughly the past 10,000 years.   
“Most Christians don’t accept the fundamentalist version of creationism,” Phelps said. “… It’s also going to hurt kids that want to have a future studying science and are going to learn all these things that just simply are not true.”
The Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter are both operated by Answers in Genesis, a fundamentalist Christian apologetics organization that promotes young Earth creationism. 
The Creation Museum opened in 2007 and the Ark Encounter, 510-foot wooden ship intended as a replica of the biblical Noah’s Ark, opened in 2016. 
LifeWise said all field trips require parental permission. 
“LifeWise programs have taken field trips to museums, local parks, sporting events and area churches,” Czernejewski said.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change) Earlier this year, some conservative states began to embrace child tax credits that put cash directly into the hands of families raising children.
Long favored by liberals, child tax credits can help ease the financial burdens of parenthood and have been shown to slash childhood poverty rates.
But despite initial optimism from sponsors and child welfare advocates, Republican proposals in Indiana and Ohio did not advance this year. Had either measure passed, it would have been the first refundable child tax credit approved in a conservative state.
“The result has been more talk than action,” said Aidan Davis, state policy director at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has tracked the issue.
Despite the Indiana and Ohio rejections, Georgia did approve a new $250 annual tax credit this year, and Utah expanded eligibility for the state’s existing child tax credit program. But both of those are nonrefundable credits, meaning they do not aid the lowest-income families, who earn too little to owe income taxes.
Refundable tax credits provide money directly to families: While parents must still file tax returns, refundable credits give parents funds even if they earn too little to owe income tax.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

“When child tax credits are refundable, they boost the incomes of families with children and can provide a little financial breathing room — which goes a long way in creating a healthy environment for kids to grow up,” Davis told Stateline.
Still, Davis said movement in states such as Utah and Georgia does mark important progress, especially if lawmakers are willing to reassess the details of the programs, namely whether to make the credit refundable.
“It’s a step forward in those states, but there are much more effective ways to design those policies to best support children and families,” she said.
Georgia’s child tax credit was a priority of Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, now a Republican candidate for governor, as part of a wider effort on child care affordability. Jones framed the child tax credit and an expanded child care tax credit as means of boosting the workforce and reducing costs for families.
In Utah, lawmakers expanded the state’s child tax credit as part of a wider tax cut package. Republican state Rep. Mark Strong argued expanding the program would help families and societies.
“We’d also love to encourage young families to have children,” he said, according to the Deseret News.
Setbacks
Early this year, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed a refundable tax credit worth up to $1,000 per child up to age 6, to be paid for by an increase in tobacco taxes. When introducing the idea, DeWine said the concept was bipartisan, “not a liberal or a conservative proposal.”
But the state House stripped the proposal from the budget. In June, advocates pushed a conference committee to reinstate the measure, but there was little appetite in the GOP-dominated chambers.
“Other than the governor, at least among the legislature, I haven’t heard anybody who was interested in bringing the idea back,” Republican state House Speaker Matt Huffman said, according to The Statehouse News Bureau.
‘Why not us?’ Nannies, housekeepers win labor protections in some states.

House leaders previously said they were skeptical of any proposed tax increases this session — including the governor’s plan to pay for the child tax credit through higher cigarette taxes.
In June, Huffman said he was more focused on delivering low taxes to Ohioans across the board and questioned the impact a $1,000 tax credit would have on families.
“I don’t think it’s a tremendous tax break to many Ohioans,” he said.
Lawmakers sent their final budget to the governor without the tax credit — but did include tax cuts for wealthy Ohioans and hundreds of millions of dollars for a new Cleveland Browns stadium. DeWine signed the budget bill July 1.
In Indiana, a plan to give a $500 refundable tax credit to families with an infant sailed through the state Senate.
The measure’s Republican sponsor, state Sen. Greg Walker, told Stateline in March he hoped the bill might prove a first step in creating a broader child tax credit program.
“I think it’s — pardon the pun — a baby step to introduce a credit for a newborn,” he said. “I don’t think anyone disputes … all the costs associated with bringing a new baby into the world.”
The bill received unanimous approval from a Senate committee and passed through the upper chamber without any opposing votes. But the measure did not advance beyond a state House committee.
In a recent statement to Stateline, Walker said he would not reintroduce the proposal next year because 2026 is not a budget cycle year for the legislature.
“There is little traction for changing tax law to reduce state receipts without a corresponding reduction in allocations,” his statement said.
Growing interest
State interest in creating or expanding child tax credits boomed after the pandemic-era expansion of the federal child tax credit delivered cash directly to millions.


12 states and the District of Columbia have refundable child tax credits.


That move quickly lifted millions of children out of poverty, according to research from Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy.
But the expanded tax credit expired in 2021 — leading to a doubling in the nation’s childhood poverty rate in 2022.
Before the pandemic, only New York and California had refundable child tax credits. Since then, 10 more liberal-leaning states and the District of Columbia have implemented such policies, according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy.
Researchers there found state programs can reduce childhood poverty and boost household incomes if the tax credits are fully refundable, provide at least $1,000 per child and are available to families with children across all ages and wide income ranges.
As child poverty doubles, states launch or expand their own tax credits

In Colorado and Minnesota — states with robust programs — child tax credits can help fill some of the void left by the end of the temporary federal expansion, said Ryan Vinh, a research analyst at the center.
Still, states don’t possess the same level of resources that the federal government has at its disposal to move the needle on childhood poverty, Vinh noted. And those resources will be further stretched with looming federal funding cuts to food assistance, Medicaid and other programs that were a part of July’s major tax and spending law.
Some state child tax credit programs are not permanent and are dependent on available funding, he said. For example, Washington, D.C., nixed funding of its $420 child tax credit this year because of budgetary concerns. And Georgia lawmakers are discussing complete elimination of the state income tax, further eroding the benefit of the new tax credit, he said.
“As states are increasingly facing these different budget shortfalls as a result of this new federal bill, they’re going to be forced to make tough decisions,” Vinh said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New billing policy by insurers sows confusion among CT physicians,Katy Golvala and Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/cigna-aetna-insurance-billing-policy/,"Physicians say the change could lead to lost revenue and increased administrative burden for providers, though confusion about it persists.","Physicians in Connecticut and around the country are sounding the alarm about a new policy by insurers they say could lead to lost revenue and increased administrative burden for providers, but confusion persists about how the policy will  be enacted.
On July 1, Cigna announced an update to its reimbursement policy. Beginning Oct. 1, the announcement said, the insurer would review claims for office visits billed at the highest reimbursement rates — “Level 4” and “Level 5.” Cigna would then reduce the rate in cases where the claims suggested the visits didn’t actually meet the appropriate level of complexity, without consulting the physician in advance.
If providers disagreed with the reduction in reimbursement, they could submit medical records substantiating the higher billing code and Cigna would adjust the reimbursement back up.
“This change is designed to reduce overbilling, promote accurate documentation, and align with the American Medical Association coding guidelines,” Justine Sessions, a spokesperson with Cigna, said in emailed comments. “Importantly, this policy change does not lead to more denials or delay care for customers in any way.”
A similar policy by Aetna went into effect in Connecticut in March 2025, Phillip Blando, a spokesperson with the company confirmed. Blando said Aetna’s billing criteria “are based on CMS and American Medical Association guidelines.”
“Evaluating the appropriateness of levels 4 and 5 codes helps us ensure providers are billing for their services consistent with national guidelines,” Blando said in emailed comments.
Reaction from physicians to the July announcement was swift. 

Dr. Peter Hahn, a cardiac electrophysiologist, works on his computer at Advanced Vein Associates in Uncasville on Sept. 15, 2025. Hahn is concerned that a new reimbursement policy announced by Aetna and Cigna will result in lost revenue and increased administrative burden for his private practice.

“My understanding, and the understanding of everyone who’s been rallying the cry about this is, the new policy just says they’re going to downcode everybody and it’s up to us to go back and fight and prove we’re not doing it inappropriately,” said Peter Hahn, a cardiologist in Uncasville. “Only then, after we file the appeal, can we get paid for the services rendered.” 
The concern from providers even caught the attention of U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who wrote a letter to Cigna calling for the policy’s reversal.
“If allowed, this new policy will significantly increase administrative burdens and costs for physicians while jeopardizing patient care. I urge you to reverse this decision and instead work closely with physicians to address any billing concerns,” Blumenthal wrote in the Sept. 11 letter.
But two days before Blumenthal sent his letter, Cigna had issued a clarification on Sept. 9 stating that the change was actually narrower in scope than the worst-case scenario Hahn and others had assumed was true.
Cigna said it will only review claims by roughly 1% of doctors in its network who “records indicate as having a consistent pattern of coding at a higher [level] for routine visits compared to their peers,” including those who, for example, bill diagnoses such as “earache” or “sore throat” as Level 4 or 5 visits. 
Cigna’s initial announcement did not contain details about the scope of the new policy, like how many providers would be impacted and what share of visits would be downcoded.
Hahn said that lack of detail caused panic and confusion, particularly among small, independent providers, like himself. Hahn estimates he already spends “probably a full day a week” devoted to “fighting with insurance companies,” and worries the policy would only exacerbate that burden. 
Cigna has already sent notifications to any provider that will be impacted by the new policy, Sessions, the company’s spokesperson, confirmed. Sessions did not respond to a question about  how many doctors in Connecticut would be impacted.
Blando, the spokesperson for Aetna, declined to respond to questions regarding details about the scope of the policy similar to the details provided by Cigna.
Hahn said that as of Sept. 19, he had not received direct communication from Cigna that his claims would get reviewed under the new policy. 
David Eagle, an oncologist based in New York, said that while the September announcement provided clarification, he still finds the policy problematic. Eagle agreed that insurers are perfectly within their rights to audit physician billing practices. But, he said, there’s a right way to do it, and this isn’t it.
Cigna is making reimbursement decisions based on claims filed, which don’t contain all the information necessary to appropriately assess the complexity of a visit, Eagle said. Instead, the company should be using medical records.
“You’re just using the wrong information set. And then it’s the problem of the physician to fight back, claim by claim, visit by visit, to get paid appropriately,” Eagle said.
Eagle said insurers have a responsibility to ensure their auditing policies are designed correctly because denials cause more work for physicians and delays in care for patients.
When faced with prior authorization requests from insurers, “everybody has to scramble on the medical side after the fact to explain and justify treatment for cancer patients, so it causes delays in treatments. And so much extra work,” Eagle said.
Mark Camel, a retired neurosurgeon and co-founder of the Greenwich-based Orthopaedic and Neurosurgery Specialists, said it’s also important that, when determining which physicians to include in the policy, Cigna compares providers to peers in the same speciality. An oncologist who sees a complex patient base and is more likely to have Level 4 or 5 visits shouldn’t be compared to an orthopedic surgeon, whose patients include people who come in with knee pain, Camel said.
Camel said the policy is “okay as long as each physician is compared within their specialty because of the variation of types of visits.” 
A representative from the Connecticut State Medical Society provided comment regarding Cigna’s initial policy but could not be reached for follow-up comment regarding the insurer’s updated policy. 
In a statement, the Connecticut Hospital Association also called for the reversal of the policies.
“We have concerns that these new policies will create uncertainty for providers and patients and add significant administrative burden and cost. They should be rescinded. Clear, transparent policies are essential to supporting fair reimbursement and ensuring patients’ continued access to care,” Nicole Rall, a CHA spokesperson, stated in emailed comments.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DOWNCODING-0916024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

The fallout of the closure paints a complicated picture in a state without maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid make maternal health care access in Massachusetts something that stands to get worse.,"SOME EMERGENCY RESPONDERS go years, decades, or even their entire careers without ever having to deliver a baby in an ambulance. For John Cuddahy, it took just a few months.  
The Leominster-based firefighter EMT completed his academy training in April, and this summer responded to a call in Leominster of a woman in active labor.  
“She was in the middle of her contractions, so we loaded her up as quick as we could and started driving out to Worcester,” Cuddahy said.  
But 10 minutes into the 20-mile drive to UMass Memorial Medical Center, the baby was delivered.  
In those critical minutes, they could have gotten the expecting mother to UMass Memorial Health Alliance-Clinton Hospital in Leominster, but its maternity unit closed two years ago, ruling that option out. 
Luckily there were no serious complications, and both patients were healthy when they finally arrived at the hospital. Cuddahy delivered the baby along with a paramedic of nearly 30 years. It was a first for both responders, but likely not their last.  
“I think it’s something to expect a lot more now that there is no maternity [unit] in Leominster. We almost had another one two shifts ago,” Cuddahy said. “It would save a lot of in-the-field deliveries if they still had it there.”

Reports of women giving birth in cars, ambulances, emergency departments, or reaching a maternity unit just in time to deliver are a far cry from what is expected in a state that consistently ranks first in the country for its health care system. 
But in North-Central Massachusetts, pregnant women and families are living a reality that data, statistics, and health care rankings don’t always show. 
Two years after the maternity unit at Clinton Hospital closed, the region is struggling. The fallout of the closure paints a complicated picture in a state that technically, according to the nonprofit advocacy and maternal health research group March of Dimes, doesn’t have maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid will make it harder to access maternal health care in Massachusetts.
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity unit services, according to Health Policy Commission data. Two birth centers in Beverly and Holyoke have also closed, leaving Massachusetts with just one free-standing birth center.  
The loss of maternity units and obstetric care is a trend seen nationwide. But while most states have at least one, if not multiple maternity care deserts – counties without hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care, and no obstetric providers – Massachusetts has none, according to March of Dimes. 
“The rate of closure is very similar for us as it is in other states,” said Chloe Schwartz, Massachusetts director of maternal and infant health initiatives for March of Dimes. “The only difference being, we started with more to begin with, so we don’t have any official deserts yet.” 
Each county in Massachusetts has been deemed “full access” by March of Dimes, meaning it has two or more hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care, and 60 or more obstetric clinicians per 10,000 births.  
“We have a standardized definition, but the folks living and working on the ground will tell you a very different story about the reality of access,” Schwartz said. “Changing access is just as difficult as having little to no access. It’s whiplash.”  
Schwartz warned that the Bay State is in a precarious position when it comes to maternity care, pointing to recent service closures and reports of UMass Memorial Health’s financial stress. 
Community Healthlink, an affiliate of UMass Memorial, recently closed two primary care programs – one in Leominster in September 2024 and another in Worcester in March – and will soon close an adult behavioral health program in Fitchburg. The system has halted hiring for all nonclinical and non-patient-facing roles and faced an $86 million operating loss in the first half of fiscal year 2025, the Boston Globe reported. 
As health care providers face an impending decrease in Medicaid payments because of the sweeping tax bill passed by Republicans, more closures could be on the horizon.  
“It’s an ever-changing landscape, and there’s so many ways in which these hospitals and health systems have to pivot, and unfortunately, maternity care is one of those areas that’s always going to be the hardest to keep open,” Schwartz said.  
More of the region’s births are now taking place at UMass Memorial’s main campus in Worcester. The facility has increased the number of labor and delivery staff “to meet the modest increase in patient volume,” said Shelly Hazlett, the hospital’s director of media and public relations, in a statement.

But maternity deserts are only designated at the county level, which doesn’t do enough to illustrate accessibility in cities and smaller areas, according to Hao Yu, associate professor of health care policy in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  
“When we talk about health care access, that’s really a local issue,” Yu said.  
In Massachusetts, the ratio of OB-GYNs per 10,000 births decreased in rural counties from nearly 162 in 2010 to 87 in 2021, while the ratio increased in urban counties in that same timeframe, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. 
Obstetric services are often not financially advantageous for hospitals due to low reimbursement rates from Medicaid, which pays for about a third of all births in Massachusetts.  
As federal cuts to Medicaid roll out after the midterm elections, Massachusetts could see even more maternity unit closures, according to Yu. Community hospitals serving low-income areas will be most at risk. “If federal support for Medicaid is going to be decreased substantially, then state governments will have difficulty maintaining their current reimbursement rate,” he said.  
OB-GYNs have one of the highest malpractice insurance premiums across all medical specialties due to a high risk of lawsuits. And, maintaining operations amid a workforce shortage is costly due to round-the-clock staffing requirements in maternity units, including OB-GYNs, nurse midwives, anesthesiologists, and other supporting staff.  
“The cost of maintaining OB units is high. On the other hand, the reimbursement from the payers for this type of service is low,” Yu said. “Putting these two together, you can imagine it’s really making OB units the easy target if hospitals want to downsize.”  
While 11 closures may not seem like a significant amount, Yu noted it represents about five percent of all obstetric unit closures that have occurred in the US in the last decade. Meanwhile, Massachusetts accounts for just two percent of the US population.  
Maternity patients in 29 municipalities increased their distance traveled by at least 5 miles between 2011 and 2021, and 14 of those communities increased their distance traveled by at least 10 miles, according to the Department of Public Health’s 2023 review of maternal health services. Only two towns – Newburyport and West Newbury – out of 351 municipalities – have residents whose average travel distance to birthing facilities decreased in the past decade. 
While they may not live in a “desert,” expecting mothers and families are driving further and further to receive care, and each closure brings more ambulance, roadside, and emergency room deliveries, meaning a delay in treatment for some of the most common complications like premature delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal hyperthermia. “Those types of births will surely be associated with adverse outcomes, both for babies and for mothers,” Yu said.
The decision to close the Leominster maternity unit in September 2023 took local leaders like Mayor Dean Mazzarella by surprise. Mazzarella, who fought alongside other leaders, residents, and health care workers to keep the unit open, said the city was notified of these problems years too late.  
“This stuff doesn’t happen overnight, so the Department of Public Health needs to do better monitoring,” Mazzarella said in an interview. “When [the UMass] Health Alliance started seeing a problem with this, they should have reported it to the Department of Public Health. We should have had these meetings then.”  
UMass Memorial officials noted that workforce shortages and declining births at Clinton contributed to the decision to shut down the maternity unit. These issues “had a significant impact on our unit’s ability to provide the best possible labor and delivery care to our patients,” Hazlett said. 
The maternity unit closure came five years after the hospital closed its 11-bed pediatric unit in 2018.  
Mazzarella, who has served as mayor since 1994 when Leominster Hospital and Burbank Hospital merged to form Health Alliance, said the Leominster campus was meant to be a strong regional hospital offering a comprehensive set of services. (UMass Memorial purchased Health Alliance in 1998 and merged the hospital with Clinton in 2017.) Now, he sees that slipping away. 
“It’s like this big network that had been established for so long is now being pulled apart in fragments,” he said. “Whether it’s a desert or not, it was certainly filling a gap at the time.”

Maternity patients have been absorbed by surrounding centers, including Henry Heywood Hospital, Emerson Hospital, or UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, which are approximately 15, 23, and 25 miles away from Clinton Hospital by car. Distance is a barrier to many pregnant patients, Mazzarella said, who used to be just a bus ride away from their obstetric care unit.  
Leominster Fire Chief Robert Sideleau called it a “tremendous loss.” His team of firefighter EMTs and paramedics have delivered an increasing number of babies in ambulances. At Clinton Hospital, emergency room secretary Shelly Roy says women have given birth in the ER because they couldn’t make it to UMass Memorial in Worchester. 
Their roadside and ambulance deliveries have been free from serious complications so far, according to Sideleau, but it’s not a matter of “if” but “when.” He worries about emergency staff having to decide between transporting high-risk patients to Leominster’s emergency room to deliver without an OB-GYN or taking a chance to transport them to UMass Memorial in Worcester.  
“That’s what makes us nervous,” Sideleau said. “If there’s a prolapsed cord or breach birth, and we were able to bring them to Leominster and right up to an OB-GYN doctor, it could make the difference between life and death.” 
The loss of the labor and delivery unit has been complicated by the closure of another community hospital – Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer – in 2024. The region’s emergency medical services have since been stretched thin.  
Traveling longer distances to surrounding hospitals means staff and ambulances are away from their stations for longer periods of time. Waiting to unload patients at crowded emergency departments only adds to the delay. Leominster’s fire department often responds to mutual aid requests from Ayer, which also means less time spent in their area. 
“If there’s another ambulance call, and we don’t have an ambulance available, then we have to call mutual aid, and it just starts the whole round robin,” Sideleau said. “The less resources up here, the busier we get.”

Amy Gagnon, a former labor and delivery nurse at Clinton Hospital who now works at Henry Heywood Hospital, said she couldn’t sleep for weeks after the closure. She worries for the future of maternal health access in the region. “If anything happens to Heywood, this whole area will be a desert,” she said.  
For months after the closure, Gagnon said Leominster patients came to deliver at Heywood but hadn’t received prenatal care there. Medical staff knew very little about their pregnancy history and due dates. Without access to their prenatal records, providers can’t anticipate complications or be ready for necessary inductions based on preexisting conditions.  
“It was hard in the beginning, because we weren’t prepared staff wise,” she said. “We only have three nurses.”  
At the time of the closure, DPH determined that the unit was an essential service “necessary for preserving access and health status within the hospital’s service area.” Beyond that recognition, the state has little authority over hospitals and service closures.  
“This feels inherently broken … When I was born in 1988, my mom had four choices between the city of Leominster and the city of Fitchburg to give birth in, and now we have zero.” State Rep. Natalie Higgins
“If the Department of Health determines that a service is essential to the health and safety of a community, why in the world do we agree to exist in a system that lets it close down?” Rep. Natalie Higgins, who represents Leominster, said in an interview.  
After the closure, Higgins authored legislation that would prevent hospitals from closing a service for three years after DPH deems it “essential.” The bill – which failed but was reintroduced in January and has yet to make its way through the legislature – did not specify if the state would help keep a service open if the hospital cites financial reasons for the proposed closure. Higgins called it a “big ask.”  
Lawmakers have also introduced a bill that instructs the attorney general to seek an injunction to keep essential services open during a required one-year notice period. It would require hospitals seeking a service closure to notify any affected cities or towns and prohibit them from applying for a new license or expanding for three years after a service or facility is closed. The current legislation has yet to pass but is scheduled for a hearing at the end of the month. 
The maternity unit was one of four essential service closures in and around Leominster in the last eight years. Higgins is worried her community will stop showing up to the closure hearings. “It’s feeling pretty futile.”  
“This feels inherently broken,” she said. “When I was born in 1988, my mom had four choices between the city of Leominster and the city of Fitchburg to give birth in, and now we have zero.” 
Emerging research has shown that birth centers and midwifery care are safe, lower-cost, and desired options for labor and delivery. They also have the potential to absorb patients that have otherwise lost access to a maternity unit or prefer not to give birth in a hospital.   
Seven Sisters Midwifery in Northampton is currently the only free-standing birth center in Massachusetts. Ginny Miller, the center’s owner, said patients drive from all over the state, as well as from bordering states, for care. They currently have a waiting list for pregnancy care and delivery until May 2026.  
New Hampshire, a state with one fifth the population of Massachusetts, is home to three independent birthing centers.  
By share of total deliveries occurring in birth centers, Massachusetts ranks 35th out of the 44 states where birth centers are available. The Health Policy Commission asserts that about 25 percent of births in Massachusetts hospitals are low-risk deliveries that could qualify for birth center care. 
But one challenge that comes with the establishment of community birth centers is that they must be within reasonable distance of a hospital with a labor and delivery unit in the event of major complications. That could rule out cities like Leominster and Fitchburg if potential centers determine that the nearest maternity hospital is too far away. 
Emily Anesta, co-founder of the Bay State Birth Coalition, called birth centers “a necessity.” Massachusetts has one of the highest rates of severe maternal morbidity – unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that can result in short- or long-term health consequences – ranking 45th in the country according to the Commonwealth Fund. A 2023 DPH report showed that the prevalence of severe maternal morbidity nearly doubled in Massachusetts from 2011 to 2020.  
“Hospital care is not what everyone needs. Midwifery care is not just something people like. … It really is lifesaving,” Anesta said. “To have that access denied for most people currently in Massachusetts is not actually giving people access to the care that they need.” 
Low insurance reimbursement rates and a lack of licensing have prevented birth centers from operating in Massachusetts, making it an uncommon, expensive option for pregnant patients. Nurse midwives are not reimbursed at the same rate as physicians and OB-GYNs, meaning hospitals and other health care centers aren’t incentivized to build or expand their midwife programs. 
In August 2024, Gov. Maura Healey signed a maternal health bill mainly providing a pathway to licensure for certified professional midwives that advocates had long called for. The legislation also requires MassHealth to cover midwifery and doula services for up to 12 months postpartum. The licensing changes have yet to be fully implemented. 
“Until that’s in place, and until private insurers also cover that care, most families wouldn’t be able to afford to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $5,000 out of pocket for their maternity care,” Anesta said. “If they went to a hospital, they would be paying less out of pocket or nothing out of pocket, depending on what type of insurance plan they have. It becomes more of a luxury option that’s inaccessible to most.” 
A state like Massachusetts, still ranked first in the country for women’s health and reproductive care, ought to be doing better, Anesta said. 
“People deserve access to options,” she added. “They deserve care that’s in their communities that feels safe and comfortable to them.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leominster-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

Republican leaders made it clear the first deadline of Sept. 30 to adopt a bipartisan map would not be met.
During the four-hour meeting of the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, defended the proposal introduced by House Democrats, with fellow legislators on the Ohio Senate side bringing forward its companion bill.
The proposals from Democrats, introduced Sept. 9, lay out eight Republican-leaning congressional districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts in a map they say is aligned with voter trends for the last 10 years.
Isaacsohn said the map meets the constitutional rules to keep districts compact and communities of interest together as much as possible, adding that it “forces competitive races, and it forces communities not to be taken for granted.”
He said he’s open to counter-proposals from the Republicans on the map, as long as the redistricting process leads to a constitutional map that gives Ohio the representation it deserves.
“When we have gerrymandering that unduly favors one party or another, it leads to policies that hurt most people, that are out of touch with where Ohioans are and what they need,” Isaacsohn said.
Committee co-chair Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Twp., claimed the constitutional rule that a map can’t unduly favor one political party is in the “third silo” of the process, only coming into play if there is no bipartisan agreement.
Currently, Ohio’s congressional map has 10 Republican members of Congress and five Democrats. That map was passed without bipartisan support in March 2022, bringing the process back this year to activate maps for the next election cycle.
The Republican caucus hasn’t proposed a map yet. Timken said the legislative caucus is working on a proposal.
“Republicans will be following the constitution, and when we propose our map, I’m sure we will make it public,” Timken said.
But Timken doesn’t agree with the 55%-45% breakdown that Democrats and their map supporters used as a baseline for a “fair” map.
“I question their logic as to why it has to be 55-45, when clearly the voters of Ohio have strongly supported Republicans over the last decade, and so, in my opinion, I do not believe the 55-45 is accurate,” she told reporters after the meeting.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Congressional maps often use the most recent presidential election as a guide, along with the last decade’s voting trends. In 2024, President Donald Trump won Ohio with 55% of the vote.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, echoed Isaacsohn’s call for productive collaboration in creating “districts that mirror the political reality of our state,” saying he would be willing to change the political breakdown if it meant the fair representation was maintained.
“If (the maps) are 9-6 and they’re constitutionally fair, I know our caucus will consider those maps,” DeMora said.
The Columbus Democrat said he’s held “more than 20 meetings” in his office with constituents talking about redistricting.
Ohioans who spoke at the meeting supported the Democratic proposal, emphasizing the need for representation that is responsive to voters, something they feel more competitive districts and a transparent redistricting process can do.
“(We have) politicians who don’t answer the phone because they don’t need to,” said the Rev. Dr. Aileen Maddox, a Dayton resident. “Their seats are safe, not because we put them there, but because the lines were drawn to keep them there.”
Maddox told the committee fair districts would bring voices to policymaking that understand the issues that Dayton residents deal with, including people of color, immigrants and all other residents.
“We could elect leaders who come from our neighborhoods, who understand the pain of losing a child too soon, who know what it means to work two jobs and still struggle to afford a prescription, and the daily lives of the people who suffer from the multiplicity of the above,” Maddox said.
As supporters of the Democratic proposal spoke on the merits of the map, they also pointed the finger at Republicans for a lack of movement in proposing a map or holding hearings before Monday.
Sen. Willis Blackshear, Jr., D-Dayton, thanked Ohioans who attended the meeting, calling their attendance “a real testament to democracy.”
“We were only given two business days notice that this opportunity to testify would arise, so it makes it even more special to see so many folks here rising to the occasion,” Blackshear said.
The senator pushed for the committee to work hard to hit the deadline of Sept. 30 for legislative action and “respect the urgency that is required.”
“If voters didn’t want September action, there’d be no process,” Blackshear told the committee. “If voters and our fellows legislators hadn’t intended us to take real, meaningful bipartisan action in September, they wouldn’t have created a detailed process for us to do just that.”
Republican co-chair Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, expressed doubts as to the discussion around the Sept. 30 deadline noted in state law as a final deadline for legislators.
“September 30th is in there, and yet, the constitution provides for a process if we don’t meet that,” Bird said. “And obviously we’re not, because we have ‘if needed’ sessions that have been determined to not be needed.”
Both Bird and Timken said the constitutional deadlines go through November, and they don’t feel rushed to make a decision before the end of the process.
“We can continue the process of gathering input from Ohioans, we can continue the process of negotiating with Democrats and we can pass a bipartisan map at any time in the next couple of months,” Bird said.
If the legislature doesn’t come to the 66% agreement in both chambers on a map by Sept. 30, the process moves to the Republican-majority led Ohio Redistricting Commission, who then have until Oct. 30 to come to a bipartisan decision.
If they don’t have the votes to do so, the Ohio General Assembly has another crack at it, with a deadline of Nov. 30.
The legislature would no longer have to have a bipartisan agreement at that time, only needing a simple majority to pass a map that would last for four years.
That simple majority agreement must come alongside a map that has certain other requirements.
The Republican committee chairs placed some of the blame on Democrats, who they said were resolute in their goal of a map with eight Republicans and seven Democrats.
“If an eight to seven map is the only one acceptable, then how are we going to get that done by September 30th,” Bird said. “It makes it very unlikely and it pushes the envelope to a potential November vote.”
The eight GOP members of the joint committee all questioned the Democratic map, with some accusing map-drawers and the legislators who are standing behind the map of pushing the map to deliberately give Democrats more seats.
“It seems to me it’s only gerrymandering if the Republicans win,” said state Rep. Brian Stewart.
Whether or not a map is adopted in September or in November, Blackshear said the renewed redistricting process should be treated as a model for the rest of the country in shirking political differences, and bringing together an effort that represents the people of Ohio.
“We can’t use (political power) as a bail-out to do what’s right for the people of Ohio, because the people of Ohio deserve fair representation,” Blackshear said.
No other hearings have been scheduled, but Timken said one more will be coming up.
She and Bird said it would occur next week, to give more of the public the chance to give input.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th. 
In America, diapers have long been treated as a luxury good rather than a necessity.
Half of families with young kids struggle to afford all the diapers they need. A quarter of families miss work as a result, often because they don’t have enough diapers to send with their children to child care.
It’s a largely invisible issue with enormous consequences for the health of parents and children. Studies have found that diaper need is a greater contributor to postpartum depression than food insecurity and housing instability. And when parents don’t have enough diapers, they make do with sanitary pads, rags or other materials. Some report having to leave their children in soiled diapers for extended periods, raising the risk for urinary tract infections and diaper rash.
So Amy Kadens, who has worked in the diaper space for nearly 15 years, wondered: What if diapers were free for the parents who need them most? For decades, the United States has not had a good answer. So she came up with her own.
Diaper banks started popping up across the nation in 2011, collecting donations and dispersing diapers to families through a complex network of local partnerships. They are one of the few lifelines for parents.
Kadens, who co-founded a nonprofit that provides diapers called Share our Spare in 2011, knew that diaper banks often operate with limited staff and resources, and operationally can only address a small percentage of a massive need. Without more government support, they can only get at a slice of the problem.
Federal assistance programs that help low-income families, such as food stamps and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), have never allowed families to use those funds to purchase diapers.
“Diaper banks are doing heroic work with very little. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” Kadens said. But, “I wanted to continue to sink my teeth into this.”
So Kadens started to work on a solution that could give people the funds to get whatever diapers they needed, without the warehouses to store donations or the teams to get those donations out.
That solution was Diaper Dollars, a $40 e-card that users get in their email every month. The virtual card comes with a barcode they can scan at checkout at most major retailers, including Walmart, CVS and Walgreens, that will cover the cost of diapers. So far, users in Illinois and Ohio can access the program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The idea, Kadens said, was to make it as simple as possible, while also giving parents the ability to choose what brands they preferred.
“Families have brand loyalty,” Kadens said. “I wanted to keep dignity and choice at the forefront of everything we did.”
The Diaper Dollars team went through months of market research to refine the tech to work well for participants. They didn’t want coupons because there was too much fraud in the system, and gift cards meant users could be limited on where to shop.
Instead, they landed on a system that allowed them to build out a catalog of diapers at 6,200 retail locations in the country. The bar code on the digital card recognizes the diapers when it’s scanned and deducts the price from the total purchase. That catalog of diapers is monitored daily and updated in case brands come out with new box sizes or products. It also works for online purchases.
The system does have some limitations. It’s not valid in Amazon or Target, two retailers that don’t yet accept that form of payment. And it also likely only covers a portion of the need: The average family spends about $100 on diapers a month, but families earning a median income can only afford to cover about $65, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It’s also more expensive — parents are paying retail prices plus sales tax (23 states charge sales tax on diapers, including Illinois). By contrast, products at diaper banks are donated or sold to the banks from the manufacturer at deeply discounted rates.
To find participants, Diaper Dollars partners with organizations such as WIC clinics and local hospitals to refer people to the program, which is funded from a mix of philanthropy and financial support from those same partners. Partners establish the eligibility criteria, how long participants can be a part of the program, and whether the stipend will be higher for those with multiple babies.
A pilot program launched in 2023 with 100 people, then in 2024 the Illinois Department of Human Services dedicated $1 million to run its own pilot at a larger scale. Nearly 8,000 people have been served so far, with 10,000 projected by 2026.
Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton told The 19th that she had been looking for solutions that could support people in the postpartum period, when maternal mortality is high, particularly for Black women. Diaper need, specifically, is linked to maternal mental health and considered a potential risk factor for moderate to high maternal depressive symptoms.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2023, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. For White women it was 14.5 deaths.
So when Illinois launched a birth equity initiative to address the needs of postpartum parents, from a home visiting program to better diaper access, it chose to partner with Diaper Dollars.
“Giving someone a card where they can go to the store of their choice, decide what’s best, that is what’s part of dignity,” Stratton said. “Every woman deserves to bring life into this world safely and with dignity.”
Brendan Kitt, Diaper Dollars’ program director, said the program was able to offer an operational solution to a problem the state wanted to address but didn’t have a mechanism for. The system works similarly to a universal basic income, where people in need are given a cash stipend, but it’s more targeted.
“Both for funders and supporters, it’s always a question when you talk to people about where the money goes,” he said. “The fact that we can limit the transactions to the specific needs that we’re trying to serve, I think, is one of the biggest things that legitimized our operation over just giving basic cash assistance.”
Parents who benefited from Diaper Dollars told the organization in testimonials that they’ve had to turn to using underwear or old T-shirts when they didn’t have the money for diapers, often making decisions between paying for rent or diapers.
After going through the program, parents reported that the funds gave them the wiggle room to buy their children other essentials or to make them better meals.
About 90 percent of those who went through the program reported being able to better afford essentials like food, rent and other bills. Some 95 percent felt less stressed about not having enough diapers.
Joanne Samuel Goldblum, the CEO of the National Diaper Bank Network, which has more than 240 partners nationwide, said a model like Diaper Dollars can address unmet needs, particularly in rural areas where it’s harder for diaper banks to distribute products.
“The need is really so big, and it’s not going to be addressed through just one sort of answer or one type of program,” Samuel Goldblum said. “It’s really important to have ways to reach people in all sorts of different communities.”
The Diaper Dollars program has raised about $2 million so far — 45 percent from the state of Illinois, 35 percent from philanthropic donors and 20 percent from grants from community partners. It is now also running in Ohio and expected to expand to Washington soon.
Kadens’ dream is to take the program to every state. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned and some red states instituted abortion bans, conservative lawmakers have been looking for ways to support postpartum parents.
In Tennessee, for example, where abortion was banned in 2022, the state rolled out a new policy in 2024 that allowed families enrolled in Tennessee’s Medicaid program to receive up to 100 free diapers a month for the first two years of life.
Samuel Goldblum said the National Diaper Bank Network has seen more bipartisan support for addressing diaper needs this year “than we’ve ever seen before.”
It should be that simple, Kadens said: “It doesn’t matter if you’re blue or red. Babies need diapers.”

(Getty Images)I have been so impressed with the good work of Alabama attorney Bryan Stevenson, especially his work going into prisons to help people who have been falsely accused and his work with young teenagers. He is a kind and compassionate soul, and in fact I just received a thank-you note from the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, thanking me for my small donation to their work.
Here in Kansas, the Wichita-based Progeny is a wonderful nonprofit organization that helps young adults in the foster care system and who have been in the juvenile justice system. According to their website, it is a “youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and reinvestment into community based alternatives.”
Progeny is a program of Destination Innovation, which helps underserved communities. I happened upon Progeny one day and watched a video of legislative testimony from Desmond Bryan White, who had served time in the juvenile justice system and was testifying about how fines and fees had affected his life, even his now adult life. I couldn’t believe that youths were charged fines and fees that saddled them with debt and despair. It seemed horrific.
Another group that works to help advocate for youths is Kansas Appleseed. They contribute statewide but are based in Lawrence. They help youths in the foster care system.
Too many young people in the foster system are abused and mistreated. They hardly have a chance at gaining a normal and nurturing childhood. Too many times, this results in being caught up in the juvenile justice system. It’s sad to me. It should be sad to everyone.
I grew up attending a private school, where I was loved and nurtured. The parents were highly involved in the process of learning for their children and we grew up knowing and feeling love and compassion. Many of my friends grew up to be attorneys, doctors, nurses and other important professions.
Youths growing up in poverty have the cards stacked against them. Too often in life, one’s ZIP code determines his or her success. At Progeny, youths are trying to reach out to other youths to help them overcome barriers to success and productivity. Those at Progeny are special and, I believe, the children of a God who loves them.
We need other alternatives and solutions for young people, rather than incarceration or punitive measures that leave everyone worse off. I guess incarceration can be the answer on occasion, but many times other forms of rehabilitation should occur instead. Pastors, rabbis and other faith leaders can get involved and have contributed to the juvenile justice issue in the past.
Should we be locking up young adults when helping them heal from past trauma can also be beneficial? I believe that there are many who care for Kansas youths. It’s time for all of us to reach out and show compassion to the children and teens struggling so much today. These are special people who need a little help and a little hope.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Great Ohio Gerrymandering Farce has lifted its curtain once again at the Ohio Statehouse odditorium of human wonders in scenic downtown Columbus.
Ohio politicians are once again pretending to be responsible stewards of the public interest and the Ohio Constitution, as though we all have amnesia and can’t remember what happened with Ohio gerrymandering in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
Instead of abiding by the will of Ohio voters and ending gerrymandering, Ohio Republican politicians executed a blatant run-out-the-clock strategy defying court rulings and imposing unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps regardless.
Ohio gerrymandering: A brief and awful history of the very recent past

Ohio Republican candidates have received an average of 56% support in the last 10 years of statewide elections, but after refusing to draw fair and constitutional maps Ohio Republican politicians control 66% of the state’s U.S. Congressional seats, 67% of the Ohio House, and 79% of the Ohio Senate.
To cap it off in 2024, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose shamelessly abused his position as chief elections officer on a citizens amendment proposing to kick politicians out of the redistricting process.
LaRose and Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board wrote ballot language for the amendment — an amendment LaRose publicly opposed — claiming that the citizen-led anti-gerrymandering amendment would actually require gerrymandering.
That was a politician abusing the public trust to put his thumb on the scale of an amendment petitioned by more than 535,000 Ohio citizens.
As dirty as politics is, sticking your finger in the eye of more than 535,000 voters on a deeply serious and foundational question about elections and the Ohio Constitution is about as low as it gets.
Confused Ohio voters shot down the amendment and left Ohio politicians in charge of drawing political districts for themselves and their fellow politicians.
Anti-gerrymandering groups warn that Ohio’s ballot language is misleading voters

Ohio Republican Party Chair Alex Triantifilou has since openly admitted that the strategy to confuse Ohio voters helped defeat the amendment: “Confusion means we don’t know, so we did our job,” Triantafilou is quoted as saying.
Ohioans should remember that our state’s current U.S. House districts are unconstitutionally gerrymandered already, as they stand now.
They were drawn by Republicans in 2022 without bipartisan support to give Republicans 10 safe U.S. House seats out of 15.
A bipartisan majority on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 rejected the Republican-drawn U.S. Congressional district map as unconstitutionally gerrymandered two separate times.
That was the last time a court ruled on the U.S. House map that Ohio voters have been forced to use since.
In a state that Trump won with 55% of the vote in 2024, and Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno won with 50% of the vote in 2024, Republicans control 66% of Ohio’s U.S. House districts.
Now Moreno is calling for them to increase that to 80%, or 12-3.
Other Republicans are calling for 13-2, which would be 87% Republican.
That would be cheating to steal 31% representation — stealing honest elections and representation from nearly 3.5 million Ohio residents.

Under the amendment to the Ohio Constitution passed by voters in 2018, politician were left in charge of the process for Congressional district mapmaking.
In 2024, politicians did their best to confuse voters, and Ohio voters once again decided to leave politicians in charge.
So now, under the same old process they abused last time, Ohio politicians will conduct another gerrymandering farce.
First the Statehouse lawmakers get a crack at drawing a map and must pass one with three-fifths of both chambers of the supermajority Republican legislature, including at least half of Democrats.
If lawmakers fail to do that by Sept. 30, the process is kicked over to the Ohio Redistricting Commission, which Republican politicians control 5-2: the governor, auditor, secretary of state, and four lawmakers, one from each party in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate.
If the Ohio Redistricting Commission fails to reach a bipartisan agreement on a map by Oct. 31, the process gets kicked back over to lawmakers, who then have until Nov. 30 to pass a map with a simple majority.
Remember, Republicans control gerrymandered supermajorities in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate.
Will politicians keep Ohio gerrymandered 10-5? Will they gerrymander more, to 11-4, or to 12-3, or to 13-2?
Who knows?
The only thing I can guarantee you is that Ohio voters will not get fair, competitive maps.
Ohio politicians will continue to make sure their fellow politicians can not be held accountable to Ohio voters in November elections.
In 2026, Ohio voters will see a November election where out of 15 Ohio U.S. House races, maybe two will be competitive, if that.
And the vast majority of the politicians will just waltz back into office, campaign pockets stuffed with special interest money, never having to worry about Ohio voters at all.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Hundreds of new state laws took effect on Wednesday, including measures that add protections from scams and fees for ticketbuyers, increase taxes on cigarettes, and allow health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to remove their names from the medication’s label, among other things. 
Unless otherwise stipulated, all non-emergency laws passed during the last legislative session took effect, as Wednesday marks 90 days since adjournment on June 25. 
Several new laws have impacts on Mainers’ everyday lives, such as changes to the tax code, labor laws and health care funding. Others are more symbolic. Maine now officially has a state amphibian (the Spring Peeper), state reptile (the wood turtle) and state dog (the Seppala Siberian Sleddog). 
Here are several ways state law has changed (the full list can be found here): 
Consumer protections 
A new law aims to protect ticket buyers from scams and fees. 
It requires ticket resellers to disclose fees up front, bans the use of fake websites and bots that circumvent online ticket limits, and prohibits resellers from adding more than 10% to the original ticket price.
This law started out as a proposal to allow the resale of tickets but was amended after strong opposition from local groups, such as the State Theatre and Portland Symphony Orchestra, which argued that it would benefit large resale platforms. 
Notably, ticket exchange and resale company StubHub supported the initial proposal, arguing it would help correct what it sees as a monopoly held by Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation Entertainment — companies that the U.S. Department of Justice sued last year for that reason. 
Another similar new law prohibits those renting short-term lodging or selling an entertainment event ticket from advertising or offering a price that doesn’t include all mandatory fees or charges, aside from taxes or fees imposed by a government, shipping charges and charges for ancillary services, such as insurance on a product purchase. 
Tax changes
Among the laws that take effect on Wednesday is the state budget addition, which raised taxes on streaming services, cannabis, pensions and cigarettes. 
Maine’s cigarette excise tax is increasing the most: from $2 a pack to $3.50 a pack.
Lawmakers also made a few tweaks to the Historic Property Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which encourages private sector investment in the rehabilitation and re-use of historic buildings. 
The amount allocated wasn’t changed, but lawmakers extended the timeframe for accessing the credits and therefore increased the cap over that longer period. The idea is that this will remove the incentive for developers to delay or space out projects across multiple tax years and, in turn, help build more affordable housing quicker. Additionally, lawmakers increased this tax credit in rural areas as a means to incentivize the revival of Maine’s rural downtowns. 
And, after a 2022 change left out the Mi’kmaq Nation from reform, a new law now ensures equal tax treatment among all of the Wabanaki Nations. 
Housing
In addition to those tax changes that incentivize housing development, other laws will help Mainers afford, and be able to remain in, housing. 
Maine lawmakers remove red tape to enable more affordable housing construction

Some of those changes were again made through the state budget, including increasing the real estate transfer tax on properties that sell for more than a million dollars and allocating that revenue to a dedicated fund for affordable housing.
Other new laws make comprehensive zoning changes to make it easier to build more units on the same lot, add restrictions for owners of manufactured housing communities to try to prevent excessive rent and fee increases, and help Maine workers afford housing and remain connected to employment by making targeted rental assistance available.
Protections for residents of mobile home parks also continued to be a focus of the Legislature. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a law that requires mobile home park owners to notify residents of their intent to sell and give them at least 60 days to make an offer. This year, a new law now gives a group of mobile home owners or a mobile home owners’ association the right of first refusal to purchase a mobile home park if the owner intends to sell. 
There are also several new laws that aim to help the unhoused. 
Municipalities can no longer ban homeless shelters. Some revenue from the real estate transfer tax will now be redirected to help sustain emergency homeless shelters. The state also allocated ongoing funds for rental assistance for homeless students. 
Health care 
Health care providers can now request their name be removed from labels on abortion medication. This type of law has emerged as a legislative trend across the country as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. 
State funding for family planning services has increased. These include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions.
The state budget and separate legislation together provide $6 million in one-time funding to providers of these services. 
Lisa Margulies, vice president of Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said this funding is even more important in light of President Donald Trump’s cuts to sexual and reproductive health care.  
In July, U.S. Congress passed Trump’s spending bill that defunded Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning by prohibiting the health care providers from receiving reimbursement payments for non-abortion services provided to patients insured by Medicaid. Maine Family Planning sued over it, but a federal judge sustained the defunding in August. 
“Politicians in Washington aren’t stopping their attacks,” Margulies said in a statement. “They are singularly focused on shutting down any provider that legally offers abortion as a component of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care. Their actions have put access to care for everyone — especially our country’s most vulnerable — at risk.” 
Another new law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish licensing standards for urgent care facilities, which previously lacked such oversight for safety, transparency and quality of care.
Judiciary 
People under 18 years old are now prohibited from marrying. The state used to have exceptions. The minimum age was raised to 17, with parental consent required, in 2023. Before that, in 2020, the minimum was set at 16, again with parental consent required. 
Adults are now prohibited from doxing minors under state law, which also allows families to seek court action for targeted children. While the impetus for this legislation came from a doxing incident in 2023, the issue gained wider attention this year after the Maine House of Representatives censured Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) for posting about a transgender student athlete on social media. 
Lawmakers made only minimal changes to Maine’s indigent defense structure this year. 
Labor
Workers now have some new protections, such as a requirement of minimum pay for reporting to work.
Farmworkers have the right to state minimum wage like most other employees in Maine, after years of failed attempts. 
Lawmakers also tweaked the laws governing paid family and medical leave — creating enforcement mechanisms and penalties and clarifying definitions — but rejected any significant changes since the program hasn’t fully been implemented yet.  
Maine paid family and medical leave benefits are slated to become available in May 2026 and will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child.
Lawmakers also expanded the state’s child tax credit through the state budget. The Dependent Exemption Tax Credit was doubled per children under six years old. 
Environment and energy
While many bills environmental advocates pushed for this year remain unresolved, some changes started Wednesday.  
State law now outlines a goal for Maine to transition to 100% clean electricity by 2040, enshrining an earlier aim Gov. Janet Mills announced in 2023. 
How key climate, environmental bills fared in Augusta this past session

Maine has led the country in establishing protections against per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS. One new law essentially codified what the state already does on a daily basis with its PFAS Response Program, including on-farm testing, crafting mitigation recommendations and providing financial support. On the other hand, Maine expanded the scope of vehicles and equipment exempt from notification requirements for the state’s first-in-the-nation PFAS reporting law.
Another law that took effect permits the transition of the current Governor’s Energy Office into a cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources. The elevation is seen by the governor and lawmakers as a way to set up a more integrated, comprehensive and consistent approach to managing Maine’s energy system. 
The state also enshrined the authority of the Public Utilities Commission to develop time-of-use rates, which aim to shift customers’ usage to periods of lower demand, for standard offer service. 
A look ahead 
On top of those bills that have now become law, the fate of 61 bills that the Maine Legislature passed this year will not be ultimately decided until next year. That’s because the governor opted to postpone her decisions on that legislation until lawmakers reconvene in January. 
Among these bills are proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine, restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns, add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results, and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
The 61 bills being held are in addition to the nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. While some of those bills had yet to make it out of committee, others received initial chamber votes but not enough to determine the final outcome. 
That legislation includes all of the measures that were left on the appropriations and study tables, which had largely passed the full Legislature but needed to still be funded or staffed.

More states are considering regulations for artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Leon Neal/Getty Images)You’ve seen the headlines: college students are outsourcing their education to AI tools.
The early anecdotes, research and surveys raise valid concerns, but this narrative is too quick to paint a picture of a technology undermining academic integrity, eroding critical thinking or even replacing the role of educators or universities altogether.
I lead the University of Nebraska at Omaha as its chancellor, and I see a different story. It wasn’t long ago that calculators raised questions about academic rigor in math classrooms. Some of us are old enough to remember how “CliffsNotes” was a dirty word in writing courses.
The emergence of the internet and Wikipedia once stirred fears about plagiarism. If you go far back enough, even Socrates had his concerns about the written word, saying “This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.” Sound familiar?
History shows us the only constant in education is new technology will emerge that forces us to confront how we teach, work and learn. History also shows us that every disruptive technology provides an opportunity to evolve education and improve lives.
Our challenge and our responsibility is to guide students to use these technologies responsibly, ethically and productively while positioning them to navigate technological revolutions successfully.
It’s why UNO in the last year alone has launched an AI Learning Lab, partnered with Open AI on a ChatGPT enterprise solution for our campus and established one of the nation’s first undergraduate degrees in artificial intelligence.
It’s also why we are inviting the community to learn about the practical ways they can use generative AI at our OMA x AI event in October. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that as an institution, we don’t view AI as a threat, but as a tool that can deepen learning, expand opportunity and strengthen workforce readiness.
First, AI can help students succeed in their academic journey. Adaptive learning platforms powered by AI can provide personalized tutoring, helping identify when a student is struggling and offering targeted resources to get them back on track. For first-generation students, working parents or learners from any number of social or economic backgrounds, AI can be a powerful equalizer, offering support that makes higher education more achievable.
Second, AI is already reshaping the workforce our students will enter. From healthcare and logistics to business and the arts, employers are seeking graduates who are comfortable using AI-enabled tools to maximize their human creativity. If universities shy away from this, we risk sending students into the job market unprepared.
Third, we must prepare students with skills and experiences that AI cannot easily replicate. Critical thinking, ethical reasoning, leadership, empathy and the ability to work collaboratively are all competencies that remain uniquely human, and they will only grow in value as AI becomes more prevalent.
This means connecting students to experiential learning opportunities like internships, service learning and community-based research, in which human judgment and creativity are essential. It also means evolving how we teach so students can pair technical skills with AI-resistant strengths. This could look like a business major learning both data analytics and communication skills so they can lead teams and close deals or a fine arts student exploring digital design alongside creative expression that AI cannot imitate. By blending innovation with timeless human skills, we give students a competitive edge that endures beyond the latest technological shift.
Finally, AI opens doors for deeper community engagement and impact. As the leader of Nebraska’s public urban metropolitan university, it is my responsibility to ensure we are partnering with local industries, schools and civic leaders to ensure Omaha and Nebraska remain competitive. My counterparts at universities across the country share that responsibility. By embracing AI in teaching, learning, research and service, we can help tackle challenges in medicine, nutrition, community safety, business, teaching and so much more.
None of this means abandoning our responsibility to teach integrity, critical thinking and ethics. Students need to learn how to use AI, but also how to question it, validate it and apply it thoughtfully. That is the true work of higher education: not to avoid new technologies but to prepare students to navigate them wisely.
AI should not replace the human element of education. It should amplify it. By embracing this moment with optimism and responsibility, we can ensure that AI helps us do what we have always done best: empower students, strengthen communities and transform lives.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 04:01:18+00:00,CT Mirror,The rigging of American history,Thomas Cangelosi,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/the-rigging-of-american-history-thomas/,Trump’s whitewashing of The Smithsonian exhibit is another part of the president’s racist campaign to repress the voice of minorities and erase their history.,"President Trump’s attack on The Smithsonian Institute for focusing too much on “how bad slavery was” is like criticizing the Bible for focusing too much on sin.  
Slavery is nothing less than America’s original sin, which all Americans have collectively inherited and whose lessons we’re responsible for learning.  It was slavery that triggered America’s internecine civil war whose scars remain today to remind us of our nation’s deeply racist wounds.
Yet even as Trump wants to distract us from “how bad slavery was,” he’d evidently prefer we focus on how great the Confederacy was, at least that’s what’s suggested by his executive order to restore a statue commemorating the Confederacy and honoring those who fought to preserve slavery. Ironically, it’s Trump’s “focus” on his authoritarian ambitions and racist convictions that distracts him from the point of both recorded history and America’s Constitutional purpose.
Indeed, during the course of his political life, Trump has tried to undermine America’s Constitutional purpose: “to create a more perfect union.”  Thus, in 2011 he lied that President Barack “Hussein” Obama was not an American citizen; in 2024 he lied that Kamala Harris was ineligible to run for president; and in 2025, he issued an executive order denying birthright citizenship for the babies of non-citizen parents, in defiance of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.  
At every turn, Trump has tried to sabotage minority representation and inclusion.
Indeed, Trump’s anti-immigrant executive orders, policies, and rhetoric have also been aimed at people of color, like his first presidential campaign in 2015 when he coupled his slogan to “Make America Great Again” with his pledge to “build a great, great wall on our southern border.”  He claimed migrants from Mexico, were “bringing drugs.  They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” He added Haitians to his 2024 racist campaign when he falsely accused them of eating the pets of Ohioans.  And let’s not forget his first term ban on Muslim immigration, his complaint of migrants from “African shithole countries,” and his preference for immigrants from “nice,” predominantly white countries, “like Denmark [or] Switzerland.” 
Further, Trump falsely claimed he won the popular vote in 2016, “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.  And he claimed during his 2024 Presidential campaign that President Biden’s border policy was a “conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America” by allowing immigrants to cross the border illegally and to register to vote.
Presently, the President’s attack on minorities includes ICE agents acting like racist brown shirts, arresting and deporting undocumented migrants without due process.  His overall strategy amounts to a campaign of vilification, disenfranchisement, and marginalization of people of color.  Simply, he believes a racially pluralist democracy spells the end of white majority rule and Republican election victories.
In fact, in 2020 Trump clearly admitted that if more Americans vote, Republicans will lose elections.  When Democrats wanted election reforms, like mail-in-voting, same day registration, and early voting to safely accommodate voters during the Covid pandemic, Trump objected: “The things they had in there were crazy.  They had things, levels of voting that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”  
Though the American democratic experiment depended upon welcoming and absorbing cultures from around the world to peacefully co-exist in a unified nation, Trump intends to preserve a white electoral majority by disenfranchising minority voters and dividing the electorate.  It explains his lie that “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting,” and his ingenuous argument that “You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in…. it’s time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It’s the only way they can get elected.” Meanwhile, he never mentioned that he encouraged mail-in voting prior to his 2024 election, which he won.
But it’s not fraud Trump is worried about—it’s growing minority influence. He doesn’t believe that voting machines and mail in ballots are untrustworthy; he just wants to suppress the votes of those likely to oppose him.  He doesn’t believe the vote has been rigged against him; he just uses that false claim to distract his followers from his calculated campaign to rig the next election. He’s not concerned about inequality when he attacks and undermines DEI initiatives—what he fears is racial and democratic equality. So, when Trump claims he will make America Great Again, it means he will make it white again.
Trump’s whitewashing of The Smithsonian exhibit is another part of the president’s racist campaign to repress the voice of minorities and erase their history, amounting to nothing less than an act of American cultural genocide.  If the President doesn’t want to hear “how horrible our country is,” maybe he should not compound America’s original sin.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Some gravestones lie flat on the ground, leaves and twigs partially covering their weathered epitaphs, like the one for “Mark Davis of Baltimore, Died Feb. 3, 1885, Aged 13.”
In another section of woods, there aren’t even headstones: About 100 cinder blocks lined in rows mark the graves of some of the Black boys buried here from the 19th into the 20th centuries and largely forgotten, the cinder blocks sunken and visited only by bees.
That was the scene that greeted about a dozen members of the Legislative Black Caucus as they walked through heavy brush, weeds and thorny undergrowth to inspect graves of boys who died in what the old House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children in southern Prince George’s County.
The neglect of the boys’ graves is made more stark by the fact that it sits next to the pristine, manicured lawn of the Cheltenham Veterans Cemetery.
“I drive past this place every day, the pristine detail that’s taken in grave sites such as this,” state Sen. Michael Jackson (D-Prince George’s, Charles and Calvert) said of the veterans cemetery, before reflecting on the forgotten an overgrown graves of the boys.
“There is no reason to disrespect anyone,” said Jackson, whose district includes the graves. “We have a lot of work to do, folks.”

The folks he was addressing were the caucus members, who are already working on legislation to not only clean up the burial site “to bring dignity and care” to the boys’ lives, but also create a commission to investigate their deaths.
A small pot of money may help with the restoration of the site near the Cheltenham Youth Detention Center, which is managed by the state Department of Juvenile Services. The department applied this summer for a $31,000 grant to the African American Heritage Preservation Program to work on restoring the wooded area.
If the grant is approved later this year, the state may invest more money for “restoration and repair of the cemetery” in next fiscal year’s capital budget, according to a statement Tuesday evening from the Gov. Wes Moore’s office.
“Our history is our power and everyone shares responsibility in preserving and uplifting the countless stories of our state that have often gone unrecognized and unheralded,” said David Turner, the governor’s communications director. “We look forward to working with the General Assembly, our state agencies, local leaders, and community advocates on this project.”
‘Scandolous’
Work on a restoration project began with former Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, who stepped down in June.
Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the department, who walked the woods with legislators on Tuesday, first visited the site last year. He later returned to look for any headstones with department staff, a volunteer genealogist and some youth from the nearby Cheltenham detention center.
Schindler said research revealed that the House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children was opened around 1870, about 20 years after the House of Refuge was opened for juvenile offenders. But that facility, on the site of what is the current Charles Hickey School, was reserved for white children.
Schindler said the conditions at the House of Refuge for white children focused “on education and treatment.” He called the treatment of Black children at the House of Reformation “scandalous.”
He said there could be more headstones because some records are missing and death certificates were not issued in most parts of the state until 1898.

“It’s hard to find the words to describe how sad and outrageous it is,” said Schindler, who led caucus members through the site. “But we just don’t know how many more here.”
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) said the injustices of the past can still be seen today, in the treatment of youth who are automatically charged as adults for a number of crimes under Maryland law. It’s why he plans to reintroduce a bill that seeks to raise the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to age 16.
Smith’s bill also proposed for those 16 and younger charged with offenses such as first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving machine guns would be eligible to go to juvenile court.
“Even our predecessors in the General Assembly understood that youth should not be in adult prisons, except they just segregated them,” Smith said. “We are still going to restore and maintain this facility and this site, but what are the next steps?”
Del. Gary Simmons (D-Anne Arundel), who visited the site Tuesday, said he’s working on legislation to assess how the state can fund efforts to to identify and restore burial sites and cemeteries across the staet. Part of that would be through the state’s Office of Cemetery Oversight, which is under the Department of Labor.
“We have a tremendous amount of neglected cemeteries here in the state of Maryland,” he said. “We have all kind of different methods that we generate funds for the state. This is about community pride. We’ll get it done.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Jared Littmann’s early lead in the Democratic primary for Annapolis mayor held, and even widened slightly, in an overwhelming win over longtime City Council Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles, according to official results released Tuesday.
The final tallies showed Littmann, a local businessman, with 2,594 votes to 1,271 for Pindell Charles, who was seeking to become the city’s first elected Black mayor. That was similar to election night results from Sept. 16, but it took election officials another week to tally more than 1,700 mail-in and drop box ballots, more than 40% of the total cast in the race.
Littmann thanked family, volunteers, donors and voters for the win in a social media post after the final results were announced. The win has been a long time coming — he announced his candidacy in January 2024, and Pindell Charles joined the race last September.
Pindell Charles, a 12-year council veteran who has served as acting mayor on occasion, also thanked her volunteers and supporters in a Facebook post, and congratulated Littman on his win.
“Thanks to everyone who participated in the Primary Election. It is important to let your voice be heard with your vote,” her statement said. “Congratulations to Mr. Littmann. The voters have spoken. And I respect the will of the voters as well as the process.”

Littmann now faces Republican Bob O’Shea in the Nov. 4 general election to succeed current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two terms. O’Shea was unopposed in the Republican primary.
The city also had Democratic primary contests in four of the city’s eight wards, including the Ward 3 seat that opened after Pindell Charles decided to make a run for mayor. In that race, Keanuú Smith-Brown got 340 votes to 77 for Deborah “Debbie” Odum. Smith-Brown will face unaffiliated candidate Mike Dye in the general election.
The closest race was in Ward 4, another open seat after Alderwoman Sheila M. Finlayson declined to run for reelection. Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson edged Coren Makell by just four votes, 144 for Allsup-Johnson to 140 for Makell.
Despite the narrow margin, Makell on Tuesday congratulated Allsup-Johnson and all the other Democratic primary winners and pledged to “supporting you all in the general election.” Allsup-Johnson could run unopposed, as no Republican or unaffiliated voter had filed to run in that ward.
In the most-crowded race, incumbent Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley cruised to the nomination over four challengers, with 481 of the 942 votes cast. Other Democrats in the race were Katie McDermott who got 293 votes, Ron Gunzburger with 137, Genevieve Torri with 19 and Ben Bramsen with 12. Huntley faces Thomas Kriek, an unaffiliated candidate, in November.
In the only other contested primary, Diesha Contee got 185 votes to Craig Cussimanio’s 124 to win the Democratic nomination. Contee will face Republican George Gallagher in the race to succeed Alderman DaJuan Gay, who is not running for reelection.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jared-Littman-at-Seasalt-Annapolis-9-16-2025-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-09-23 23:56:51.778328

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle Lawyers for Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara and his family are asking a federal court to stop U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting him while he is in their custody.
Guevara’s lawyers, who include those from the American Civil Liberties Union, asked the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Georgia on Monday for his release and to halt any potential deportation after federal officials suddenly resurrected an older immigration case Friday. His lawyers also requested an emergency hearing and his release on Friday.
Guevara, a Salvadoran native who has lived in the United States since 2004, according to court documents, has been held in immigration detention since June 14, when he was arrested while livestreaming an anti-ICE protest in Atlanta. His misdemeanor charges were ultimately dropped but not before he was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.
His arrest and continued detainment has alarmed free speech advocates and attracted national attention. 
The ACLU and Guevara’s family, including his children Katherine and Oscar Guevara, are calling for his immediate release, saying that his detention is illegal and a violation of his First Amendment rights.
“No one should have to face this fear of punishment for their free speech in this country. Still, we are holding on to hope that the government will do the right thing and release him at once. His place is with his family and his community, not behind bars or facing deportation,” Katherine Guevara said.

But a point of contention in the case is Guevara’s immigration history. In a statement, ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the “facts of this case have not changed. Mario Guevara is in the country illegally.” McLaughlin said Guevara was granted voluntary departure in 2012 but refused to leave and was subsequently given a “final order of removal from an immigration judge in 2012.”
Scarlet Kim, ACLU’s senior staff attorney, disagreed, calling ICE’s statement “incorrect.” According to Kim, while Guevara was granted voluntary departure in 2012, he appealed the decision. His case was then administratively closed, legally authorizing him to remain in the U.S. for the last 13 years.
“He never received a final order of removal,” Kim said in a statement.
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.
Kim said the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened the removal proceedings and reinstated the voluntary departure order Friday, giving Guevara 60 days to leave the country voluntarily. The ACLU argued in a court filing Monday that because he is in detention, ICE could undermine the voluntary departure order and deport him at any moment.
“This decision renders the Court’s intervention all the more urgent. Notwithstanding that Mr. Guevara was granted voluntary departure—which gives him 60 days to voluntarily leave the United States—the Government has offered no assurances that it will not put him on a plane back to El Salvador at any moment,” Guevara’s lawyers wrote in the filing.
First Amendment experts speaking at a press conference Tuesday said that the government’s actions against Guevara are part of a broader trend of suppressing free speech and intimidating journalists. Clare Norins, a law professor and director of the First Amendment Clinic at the University of Georgia, also representing Guevara, said that he is the only known journalist currently detained in the U.S. for his reporting. 
“Even though all the criminal charges against him were dropped, the government claimed that Mr. Guevara’s filming and reporting on police activity occurring in public made him a danger to the community. In other words, they continued to detain him for exercising his First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and of the press,” Norins said.
ICE has previously disputed claims that Guevara’s detainment was connected to his reporting.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1906-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 22:57:09.262854

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)More than 25,000 Alaskans who buy health insurance through the federal marketplace will face massive and possibly unaffordable cost increases if federal subsidies expire at the end of the year.
“I do think it’s important to recognize that we should be seeing thousands of people likely lose coverage from this,” said Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital and Healthcare Association.
In a panel discussion last month, local experts in Juneau laid out the stark reality for Alaska, which has the highest health care costs in the nation. 
Speaking to a room at Juneau’s convention center, they said if federal subsidies end, the cost of health insurance would rise so much that many Alaskans will go uninsured, discouraging them from getting checkups that could prevent serious illnesses. Hospitals would see a larger number of emergencies from uninsured people, straining them. It might even lead to an exodus from the state, as people seek alternative options and cheaper places to live. 
“I worry about that,” said Kim Champney, executive director of the Alaska Association on Developmental Disabilities. “Because I think people will decide to leave Alaska because we have the most expensive health care in the country.” 
Anton Rieselbach, with the Juneau Economic Development Council provided an analysis of cost estimates for Juneau. In Alaska’s capital city alone, 1,389 people receive health care via insurance plans bought through the federal marketplace. Right now, those Juneauites pay an average of $124 per month. If those subsidies expire, that will rise to $1,008 per month, an increase of more than 700%.
The council, a nonpartisan organization devoted to economic growth in the capital city, is worried about what will happen if the subsidies expire.   
“We want people to be working and spending money, generating economic activity,” Rieselbach said, “but this just places another huge burden on people’s ability to spend their money in other arenas besides health insurance.”
A problem years in the making
The upcoming problem stems from federal subsidies enacted by Congress in 2021 and extended through the end of 2025. Those subsidies, known as “enhanced premium tax credits,” were applied on top of subsidies included in the original Affordable Care Act, which established the federal insurance marketplace.
Now, almost anyone who buys an individual health care plan through the marketplace gets some kind of subsidy.
Generally, that includes people whose employers don’t provide health insurance, self-employed people, and people who retired early and aren’t yet eligible for Medicare, which insures people with disabilities and people 65 or older. 
Subsidies helped expand the number of people on federal marketplace plans from 11.4 million in 2020 to 24.3 million this year, allowing millions of Americans to get regular health care.
They also came at a high cost to the federal treasury: Extending them for another 10 years would cost $335 billion. 
But if subsidies end, Alaska would be exceptionally hard-hit. The state has the highest health-care costs in the nation, which means unsubsidized insurance rates are high. 
Of the 28,736 Alaskans who have health insurance policies through the federal marketplace, 25,170 receive the enhanced subsidies, according to figures published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
If the enhanced subsidies expire, the poorest Alaskans will still see their plans subsidized. Middle-class Alaskans would be hard hit.
According to estimates published in March by the Alaska Division of Insurance, a single 50-year-old who earns $58,650 per year would see their monthly health insurance cost rise from $282 per month to $407 per month for a “silver” plan. If they have a “bronze” plan, their costs wouldn’t change.
But Alaskans who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty line — $78,000 per year for an individual — would see their costs skyrocket. 











In 2023, 2024 and 2025, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.



That same 50-year-old would go from paying $534 per month for a silver plan to $1,415 per month. Under a bronze plan, their cost would go from $9 per month to $890 per month.
Lori Wing-Heier, the director of the Division of Insurance at the time of those estimates, called the increase “pretty horrific” for affected Alaskans. 
“It’s an insane amount,” said Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, talking about the increase.
This spring, Mina sponsored and the Alaska Legislature passed House Joint Resolution 9, a bipartisan letter asking Congress to extend the subsidies.
Across the state this year, the average monthly premium for Alaskans of all ages and all plans was $971.43, but the average subsidy was $866.28, the Division of Insurance said in March. 
Kosin, of the hospital and healthcare association, said his group thinks it’s “really important” to extend the enhanced subsidies. 
Insurance is based on the concept of sharing risks and costs. The more people in an insurance pool, the better it works. Subsidies encourage healthy people to be a part of the health insurance pool, he said. If people drop off, the cost of caring for any individual person is spread among fewer members, and rates go up.
An extension relies on congressional action
For the moment, Alaskans only have estimates of what will happen if the subsidies expire. Open enrollment on the federal insurance marketplace starts Nov. 1. There’s a “window shopping” period at the end of October that will give a sneak preview.
People must sign up by Dec. 15 to get insurance coverage that starts with the new year. Miss that deadline, and Jan. 15 is the deadline to get coverage that starts Feb. 1.
Kosin said he’s heard the argument that Alaskans could afford health care before the enhanced subsidies came into effect, and so there won’t be many people who drop their coverage.
That fails to take into account the way health insurance costs have gone up since 2020, he said.
In 2023, 2024 and 2025, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.
“If there truly is a doubling or tripling of premiums, especially at once, I think I would have to guess it would be a higher percentage than a fifth of the population that would consider themselves priced out of the market,” he said.
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski knows plenty of those people.
“If you are a 60-year-old couple (earning about) $82,000 in Alaska, you would be looking at a premium increase … without enhancements, of $44,556. My husband and I are over 60. Now, granted, we’re not on the exchange, but I have a lot of friends are in that category, and I don’t know very many of them that could swallow an additional $44,000 a year to pay for their insurance if they’re on the exchange,” she said in a Sept. 17 phone call.
Murkowski is among the members of the U.S. Senate who have been trying for months, without success so far, to find enough votes to extend the subsidies.
Impending government shutdown
The issue has now gotten entangled with the impending government shutdown. Senate Democrats have demanded — among other things — a permanent extension of the health care subsidies, without changes, in exchange for their votes on keeping the federal government open.
Sen. Dan Sullivan also supports an extension of the subsidies, but “there’s no way I would ever vote for that,” he said of the Democratic plan.
“I do think there’s bipartisan support to get this done. We’ve just got to power through these different issues,” he said by phone.
He identified three hurdles for the subsidies. 
“It’s how long you extend them; are there pay-fors (budget cuts to compensate for the cost of the extension) … but the most important and complicated — and we just did a deep dive on this, and I do think there’s bipartisan support on this, is reforms,” Sullivan said.
“We are looking at ways to reform the system to make it work for the people who need it and are using it honestly, but have a disincentive against those who have been abusing it,” he said.
“We’re getting there. It’s complicated. I think the reform piece is going to be the most complicated, but I’m hopeful, and I’m putting a lot of effort into it,” Sullivan said.
Murkowski is more interested in a straight extension without changes. She introduced a standalone two-year measure and voted against both Republican and Democratic proposals to keep the government open, saying one of her conditions was an extension of the subsidy.
Speaking by phone this month, Mina noted that an extension has the support of groups as far afield as the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce.
“I think if you’re directly on the insurance marketplace, you should be concerned. But also, if you care about economic diversification and startups, you should also be concerned,” she said.
If the marketplace doesn’t work, she noted, it would increase the costs of health care for everyone in the state because hospitals are required to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. If people can’t pay, that means their costs get shifted to people who can, increasing the health insurance rates of everyone, not just those on the marketplace.
“What I fear is that we’re regressing to the state that we were in (a decade ago) when we had all of these news articles about people paying like, $800, $1,000 a month for their health insurance, and we were able to stabilize that and find solutions to help people,” Mina said. “We’re just going backwards in that regard.”

According to the study’s authors, South Dakota women are imprisoned at a rate of 338 per 100,000. That’s a higher rate than Montana or Idaho, in the second and third spots in the ranking of female incarceration rates. All three states have higher rates than El Salvador, the country with the highest incarceration rate.
The nationwide incarceration rate for women in the U.S. is 112 per 100,000. 
The report is titled “States of Women’s Incarceration: The Global Context 2025.” The Prison Policy Initiative built its rankings by looking at women incarcerated in prisons, jails and tribal jails.
The press release on the report notes that well over half the women imprisoned in South Dakota are held on drug charges or crimes. It also notes that the state voted in 2022 to build a new women’s prison in Rapid City to manage the overcrowded South Dakota Women’s Prison in Pierre. The new women’s prison is under construction at a cost of $87 million.
Female incarceration rates have declined in most states, the report says, but South Dakota’s rate has increased. According to a state data brief cited in the nonprofit’s report, the number of women incarcerated for violent crimes in the state increased 33% between 2013 and 2023. The number of female drug offenders grew by 66% in the same time period.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden pledged last week to create a rehabilitation and recidivism task force to study high rates of incarceration and repeat offenses.

(Congressional photo)Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany launched his campaign for governor Tuesday afternoon — becoming the third, and highest profile, candidate in the 2026 Republican primary. 
The 2026 race for governor in Wisconsin will be the first open election in over 15 years as Gov. Tony Evers decided to retire at the end of his second term. Two other Republicans are already in the race: Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien. 
“In 2026, Wisconsin will have a choice between opportunity, security, and freedom or following the path of failure seen in Minnesota and Illinois,” Tiffany said in a statement after officially launching his campaign on a conservative talk radio show hosted by Dan O’Donnell. “I will not allow our state to be dragged down that woke and broke road.”
Tiffany, who lives in Minocqua, had been teasing a run for governor for months and is expected to have an official launch event in Wausau on Wednesday evening.
The 67-year-old said in a statement that he would seek to “freeze property taxes, protect our farmland from Communist China, and fight every day for families, for farmers, and for the hardworking people who make this state great.”
In contrast to the short list of Republicans running so far, the Democratic primary field has become increasingly crowded in recent weeks. Official candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong and beer vendor Ryan Strnad. Others considering a run include Attorney General Josh Kaul, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, who recently announced she would be stepping down from her position in the Evers administration. 
Tiffany was elected to represent Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District, a massive area that encompasses the northern part of the state, in the House of Representatives in a special election in 2020. He took over from current U.S. Transportation Secretary and former Republican Rep. Sean Duffy, who had resigned to care for his family.
Before going to Washington, D.C., Tiffany was in the state Legislature, first in the Wisconsin State Assembly for about three years, followed by nearly eight years in the state Senate. During his tenure, he served on the state’s Joint Finance Committee, which is responsible for writing the state budget. Before that, Tiffany was the Town Supervisor of Little Rice and managed petroleum distribution for Zenker Oil Company.
Tiffany said that he could stay in Congress for much longer if he wanted to, but that he thinks he can do more as governor and is in the race to “uphold conservative principles.”
“It really is time for new leadership and I believe I have the vision to be able to lead the state of Wisconsin and make us one of the great states of America once again,” Tiffany said. 
In Congress, Tiffany is a member of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus and has been a consistent ally to President Donald Trump.Tiffany also supported attempts to overturn former President Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election. So far this year, Tiffany has supported Trump’s tariffs and crack down on immigration, including targeting the H-1B visa program. 
“I support them,” Tiffany said of Trump’s tariffs in his interview with O’Donnell. “At the end of the day if the tariff regime is handled properly, we are going to bring manufacturing back to the United States of America.” 
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker criticized Tiffany in a statement, calling him “Tariff Lover Tom” and saying he “has been jacking up prices on Wisconsin families with his blind support for a trade war that is making everything from beer to beef to school supplies way more expensive — working Wisconsin families can’t afford Tariff Lover Tom being in charge.”
Tiffany said that he would also seek to uphold Wisconsin’s 20-week abortion ban. He has supported federal legislation in the past that would ban abortion at six weeks. 
“I do support that law, and I will uphold it as governor of the state of Wisconsin,” Tiffany said. “I think back to the debate that we had 10 years ago, and you had people on both sides. You had some that were, like, we want unlimited abortions. We had others that said there should be no abortions allowed in the state of Wisconsin, and ultimately, the people of the state said we really want to see something in the middle.”
Tiffany also said he would work to reduce taxes in Wisconsin, including freezing income taxes.  He didn’t commit to a flat income tax or eliminating the income tax as some Republicans have proposed.
“I also believe we can reduce income taxes. Can we take it down to zero? I don’t know the answer to that,” Tiffany said.

“If something is not done very quickly and substantially, I’m afraid people are going to go ahead and make decisions that they can’t change back,” Kirk Vansandt, the chief agriculture lending officer for Farmers and Merchants Bank, told a legislative panel in Stuttgart.
Tuesday’s hearing before the House Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources subcommittee was the latest in a string of high-profile public meetings where members of the state’s agriculture community have exhorted Arkansas’ congressional delegation and President Donald Trump to come to the aid of commodity crop farmers, who are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand.
Without aid, many in the industry believe 25-40% of farmers will decide to bow out after this season, Vansandt told the panel. Arkansas led Southern states in the number of Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies in 2024, according to a presentation shown to the subcommittee — and it’s already far surpassed its 2024 Chapter 12 totals in 2025.
“Personally, I think it’s one out of three people if nothing happens. It’s that dire,” Vansandt said.
Vansandt said his impression after a recent trip to the nation’s capital was that aid will come — but he worries it might not be soon enough.
A provision of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that passed earlier this year provided some assistance for farmers, but that aid isn’t set to hit bank accounts until fall of next year. Those addressing the subcommittee almost universally said that wouldn’t be soon enough to avert mass closures of farms.
“We’re in such a dire strait with our export markets,” Vansandt said. “It’s going to take a bridge to get us all from right now to the fall of ’26.”
The industry representatives stressed that it wouldn’t only be farmers who suffered if farms began to close en masse — so would the small rural communities they support, many of which have already lost large numbers of their populations in recent years. The businesses that support farms, like agricultural aviators, farm banks and parts stores, would also take a hit, they said.
Rep. Stephen Meeks, R-Greenbriar, asked what, if anything, the industry spokespersons wanted to see the state do to help.
“My concern is, if it’s just a money issue, for every dollar that we give y’all to help you weather the storm, that’s $1 we’re taking from another Arkansas family … that’s also struggling to put food on the table,” Meeks said. “We can’t print money like the federal government.”

Ross Wood, the retail operations manager for Stratton Seed, said help with taxes on capital expenditures or fuel would help.
“Taxes on parts and maintenance — that kills us,” Wood said. “Any help would help.”
Numerous people said they didn’t want handouts, but that they had become necessary in the face of a market that was not profitable. Vansandt put it bluntly: “That’s just not the world we’re living in right now.”
“Subsidies are going to be the only thing that can make up the difference,” he said.
The toll is not just financial. One farmer who was asked to speak, Sydney Robinett, said the stress of managing the downturn is the kind that doesn’t go away at the end of the work day.
“It gets in bed with you,” he said. “Sometimes it’s better to be awake than it is to sleep at night, because when I’m awake, I can think of what’s going on today. The bad dreams happen at night. The bad dreams are going out of business. The bad dreams are the uncertainty.”
Subcommittee Co-Chair Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, became emotional as she concluded the meeting. Noting her own job as a farmer, she said her heart broke for those struggling in the current commodity market.
“I’ve been saying for several weeks: February next year is way too late for us to forecast what this is going to do for our state,” Vaught said. “[By] November, we will have farms that have already made the decision to shut down, and they will never be able to go back into production again.”

(Screenshot courtesy of Arkansas Legislature live feed)Arkansas legislative leaders pressed state corrections officials Tuesday to acknowledge that a May prison escape resulted from systemic failures rather than solely the actions of two employees.
Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne said the escape of a convicted murderer and rapist wouldn’t have happened had the two workers — a kitchen supervisor and a tower guard — done their jobs and followed policy. Those employees were fired shortly after Grant Hardin’s escape and recapture on June 2.
“Those two employees were the main characters,” Payne told Rep. Howard Beaty Jr., a Crossett Republican and co-chair of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Charitable, Penal and Correctional Institutions subcommittee.
Four other employees at the North Central Unit near Calico Rock have been suspended and one demoted since the escape, according to documents presented to the committee.
The documents included an extensive Arkansas State Police report detailing how Hardin, 56, escaped and breakdowns in communications and policy lapses. The 900-plus pages of the report include summaries of interviews with prison employees and supervisors and others involved in the 10-day search for the escapee.
Legislators focused on the policy lapses, including confusion over whether kitchen staff had been directed not to let any inmates out onto a kitchen loading dock without supervision. A standing written order that allowed kitchen workers assigned to cleaning duties to work on the dock — where Hardin had been — without supervision was superseded by a verbal directive just weeks before the escape, the state police report determined. But not all kitchen supervisors remembered hearing that specific command, the report noted.
There also was some confusion about who was responsible for alerting state police and other law enforcement agencies to the escape, which delayed notifications and quick action, according to the report.
“We definitely have some policy issues we have to work through,” Payne later told Sen. Ben Gilmore, a Crossett Republican who is the ALC’s co-chair.

Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace agreed that her department and prison administrators must address several policy issues raised by the state police report as well as the Division of Correction’s own internal incident review.
Republican Sen. Matt McKee of Pearcy, the subcommittee co-chair, said, “It sounds like everyone was confused out there that day. And that comes down to the leadership of the warden … So this isn’t just about two employees. This is a failure systemically because we didn’t have the training, we didn’t have the policies worked out.”
Payne, asked if he’d decided to discipline Warden Thomas Hurst, replied that he was still reviewing the matter.
Tuesday marked the third meeting since June at which the subcommittee heard testimony about Hardin’s escape and how prison staff and corrections leaders handled it and its aftermath.
The Division of Correction internal report noted that Hardin should have been classified as a high-security inmate rather than medium because of his dual convictions. His custody classification score had not been reviewed since October 2019, but even then his score should have made him ineligible for incarceration at the North Central Unit, the report said.
Rep. Jason Nazarenko, R-Cotter, asked Wallace what the Corrections Department was doing to fix the classification system to prevent inmates from being misclassified.
Although the classification system is automated, staff employees review them, Wallace noted. Department and correction division personnel policies, however, prevented the departmental supervisor from disciplining unit-level classification personnel who don’t follow her guidance, according to the internal report. The report recommends additional training for unit classification staff and more frequent review. 
Wallace said that her department is reviewing other policy changes that would “hopefully stem future problems.”
Department Chief Legal Counsel Tawnie Hughes told the panel she didn’t know how Hardin’s misclassification happened. When she tested the automated system, she said, she always got the number of points that should have sent to Hardin to a maximum security prison. He has been at the Varner Unit since his recapture.
“What we need is another set of human eyes … We’re working on a training system that will help,” she said.

(Getty Images)Pennsylvania is looking to join the multi-state lawsuit against the federal government over demands to share Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients’ data, potentially protecting $461 million in benefits for two million people across the state.
A hearing on adding Pennsylvania to the litigation is set for next week after the states filed a motion late Monday to add the commonwealth, according to court documents.
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney issued a temporary restraining order last week blocking the federal Department of Agriculture (USDA) from collecting data on SNAP recipients and preventing the withholding of any funding until at least Oct. 9 in the 21 states and Washington, D.C., already part of the case, court documents show.
That would extend to Pennsylvania, too, if Chesney agrees to add the commonwealth.

USDA also has indicated it will withhold SNAP funding from Kansas because Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly hasn’t complied with the federal data-sharing directive. Kelly’s office told The Kansas Reflector they’ll appeal that decision, but didn’t say whether her state would be joining the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the state’s Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach is suing Kelly and her Department of Human Services secretary over the issue.
Citing data security concerns, Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services (DHS) had been holding off on passing food stamp recipient information to the USDA. Hoa Pham, the state’s deputy secretary of Income Maintenance for DHS, told the federal agency as much at the July 30 deadline to set up data-sharing with the federal government.
A few weeks later, the Trump administration threatened to yank nearly half a billion dollars in SNAP support annually (nearly 11 percent of the total, equivalent to the state’s error rate) if the commonwealth didn’t comply by Sept. 19, according to WESA.

Instead, Pennsylvania officials submitted documents to USDA essentially declining to participate, claiming doing so risked violating federal law in light of the Sept. 18 order in the case the commonwealth now seeks to join, court documents show.
The controversy over SNAP beneficiary data has unfolded amid the onset of new qualification requirements that could eliminate benefits for 144,000 Pennsylvanians as well as looming cuts that could cost the state between $125 million and $800 million. Meanwhile, Medicaid has dealt with comparable turbulence over information seeking about recipients and changes to qualification standards.
USDA has said SNAP recipient information will help stem fraudulent use of program benefits. As part of that mitigation effort, the agency says law enforcement will have access to the database – and that’s provoked concerns that it will be used for other purposes as with Medicaid data handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The information sought includes names, addresses, social security numbers, occupation and education information, plus citizenship, immigration and marital status, according to USDA documents.

Wirth previewed his plans for the upcoming Oct. 1, 2025 special session to address impacts from federal policy on Medicaid, food assistance and vaccines. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico state Democratic leadership plans to bring forward at least four bills for the Oct.1 special legislative session — including one intended to insulate the state from federal changes to vaccination policies.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the session earlier this month and said it would be geared primarily at addressing impacts from the Congressional Republican spending bill signed into law by Trump this summer. The session start date coincides with a possible shutdown of the federal government. State Republicans have since pushed to expand the agenda to include topics such as interstate medical compacts, but have faced resistance from Senate Democrats.
However, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a call Tuesday that one of the bills that leadership intends to bring will allow the New Mexico Department of Health to “set their own standards.”
That move comes as U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. upends federal health policies.

“The federal standards are being thrown all over the place,” Wirth said. “As we go into COVID season and flu season, we’ve got to make sure vaccines are available based on the recommendations of our health folks, not tied to the federal standards.”
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Deputy Communications Director Jodi McGinnis Porter confirmed to Source NM in an email that vaccines will be on the agenda for the special session.
“We can confirm that it will be on the call,” she wrote. “But we don’t have the exact language yet.”
Additional bills, Wirth said, will include ones replacing a federal tax credit poised to end at the end of the calendar year; making changes to the state’s rural health care fund; and a general budget bill including money for state agencies and public media stations.
In his first interview with Source NM since  Sept. 11 bomb threats to his home and office, Wirth said no additional security measures will be in place for the upcoming session, noting the Roundhouse bans weapons and requires people to enter through metal detectors.
“I certainly feel safer here, and I know the public does as well,” Wirth said. “Having said that, though, this is a challenging time and we’re certainly gonna be vigilant. ”
Wirth also held firm in his opposition to adding medical compacts to the Oct. 1 session.
“I do support the medical compacts — I think that’s priority number one, and we’re going to get that done in January and work hard between now and then to make it happen,” Wirth said. “But it’s just not ready to go at this point in the special session.”
The exact timing for Oct. 1 special session  is variable, but he hopes to gavel out “in a couple of days.”
A closer look at the proposals
For the targeted tax credit, lawmakers would appropriate about $177 million in order to try to prevent rising health insurance costs from a tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, Wirth said, which is also being debated at the federal level.
“We can try and hold New Mexicans harmless, and what I mean by that is keep them in the same place they would be if this tax credit weren’t being rolled back,” Wirth said.
The second bill would make some changes to the state’s Rural Healthcare Delivery Fund, established in 2023, and paying out $80 million between 2024 and 2026 for new services in counties with a population fewer than 100,000.
Wirth said the changes would allow for the fund to support current health care programs and allow for greater participation by removing the population limit.
“There’s lots of rural pockets and larger counties, and we want to make sure that those funds can be used for that rural health care,” he said.
Finally, the budget bill will include at least a $20 million appropriation to the New Mexico Health Care Authority for technology upgrades and to address the new federal requirements.
A variety of other appropriations remain that lack solid figures, Wirth said, including funds to address changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); additional behavioral health work in the courts; and funding for public television and radio stations after the federal cuts.
“What you’re going to see in this special session is us stepping up to make sure that the basic support net stays in place, especially when it comes to food and healthcare,” Wirth said.
The special session is only ”step one” and more priorities will be addressed in the regular January session, he said, such as juvenile justice and the medical compact questions.
“We’re going to be back in January for step two, and I think we’re going to be dealing with this in sessions for the next number of years to come,” he said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)As buses hummed and beeped around Rhode Island’s central bus hub in Providence Tuesday evening, dozens wearing black and holding candles gathered to mourn an impending loss. 
The crowd was not mourning a person, but the state’s bus network. Sweeping cuts to its service set to take effect Saturday will radically transform the state’s public transit offerings, advocates say.
“Dearly beloveds, we are gathered here today to say RIP to RIPTA as we know it,” Liza Burkin, board president of the Providence Streets Coalition, told over three dozen people assembled at Kennedy Plaza. 
Starting Sept. 27, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) will reduce service by cutting some buses, reducing schedule spans, decreasing frequency, and getting rid of segments on 46 of its 67 lines — primarily impacting weekend and off-peak hours. 
RIPTA board approves less drastic service cuts. But plan is no victory for bus riders.

Three routes will be eliminated on Saturdays, while another three will no longer run on Sundays or holidays. Four additional routes are being cut from weekends altogether, including the 68 line that links Newport’s North End with the city’s beaches — a service that is fare-free through the end of October.
“This is the Ocean State, and we’re cutting off access to the ocean for our working class on their days off,” Burkin said. “Shame.”
Even the agency’s top-performing route will not be spared. The R-Line — the state’s only rapid bus line which connects Cranston, Providence and Pawtucket — will now run buses every 20 minutes on weekends instead of every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night.
The upcoming service changes resulted from an earlier, more extensive plan that had 58 routes facing cuts or reductions to try and stave off a $10 million budget deficit for the agency. That included the complete elimination of 11 routes and zones where riders book trips in advance. 
The agency’s board was scheduled to approve those deeper cuts Aug. 7, but postponed the decision after Gov. Dan McKee sent a last-minute letter asking the board to draft a less severe plan.
The result was a “budget framework” announced by McKee ahead of the RIPTA board of directors’ Aug. 28 meeting, where he offered $3 million in federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality funds the agency would later have to pay back.
McKee’s office stands by this latest service adjustment, saying that reductions were based on demand data and post-pandemic ridership patterns.
“The governor’s agreement with RIPTA leadership puts the authority on a strong financial footing as we invest in projects like the new multimodal transit center to boost ridership and strengthen the agency — all while protecting taxpayers,” spokesperson Andrea Palagi said in an emailed statement.

While less drastic, advocates argue the upcoming changes will only harm RIPTA and the state in the long run. And if service gets worse, advocates will place blame squarely on McKee.
“Gov. McKee wants us to be grateful for the short-term and insufficient Band-Aids given to RIPTA because it could have been worse than his original proposal as though he is not the person responsible for putting us in this position in the first place,” Bove said.
The deficit was originally $32.6 million when McKee unveiled his recommended fiscal 2026 budget in January — a budget Bove called “callous and cruel.”
Lawmakers eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, much to the dismay of McKee.
“How did the governor respond to that you might ask?” Bove posed to the crowd. “By throwing a temper tantrum and refusing to sign the budget like a middle-schooler not getting their way on the student council.”
That drew a laugh from McKee’s 2026 Democratic primary challenger, former CVS executive Helena Bounano Foulkes, who stood among the crowd. 
“This is his budget and budgets are choices — they represent our values,” Foulkes told Rhode Island Current after the rally. 
But for now, riders must contend with reduced service, though advocates remain hopeful the cuts can be reversed when lawmakers reconvene in January.
“So many of you have fought alongside us for so long and we have a lot more left in the tank,” Burkin said.

Rhoden was speaking in support of a proposed new men's prison in northeast Sioux Falls. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — After 144 years, South Dakota lawmakers decided Tuesday it’s time for “the Hill” to retire.
The required two-thirds of each legislative chamber voted to endorse a 1,500-bed, $650 million replacement for the state penitentiary building that opened its doors when South Dakota was still Dakota Territory. The new prison will be the most expensive capital project ever funded by the state’s taxpayers.
The prison will be built in northeast Sioux Falls, on an undeveloped patch of industrial land near the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society. The location is about 3 miles northeast of the penitentiary, nicknamed “the Hill” for its perch overlooking the Big Sioux River.

The votes came during a one-day special session at the Capitol called by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden after a prison construction task force he created via executive order had recommended  a new prison with that size, price tag and location. The Senate approved the prison plan legislation 24-11, and the House approved it 51-18, with one House member, Rep. Jeff Bathke, R-Mitchell, excused while on a military deployment.
A previous men’s prison proposal with a higher price and a controversial location in rural Lincoln County, was presented in February during the regular legislative session and failed to earn the two-thirds support mandated for spending bills by the state constitution. 
Tuesday’s vote answers the most pressing and expensive question posed during a four-year saga on the future South Dakota’s prison facilities. In 2021, then-Gov. Kristi Noem commissioned a study of the Department of Corrections properties that concluded the state needed a new women’s prison — which is now under construction in Rapid City at a cost of $87 million — and that the oldest parts of the penitentiary had too many inmates and was unsafe for them and the staff. 
The state plans to pay for the new prison with cash. In 2022, lawmakers voted to begin putting millions in excess revenues, which ballooned thanks in part to federal cash infusions during the COVID-19 pandemic, into an incarceration construction fund that has since grown with further deposits and interest earnings. The next year, they approved the construction of the women’s prison.
The bill passed Tuesday transfers $78.7 million from the state’s budget reserves to the prison construction fund and authorizes the Department of Corrections to spend up to $650 million to build it. Most of the money is already in the fund, but about $42 million of the required funding is expected to come from future interest earnings.
Between 2024 and Tuesday’s vote, the state put $52 million into a plan to build a 1,500-bed men’s prison — at a price of $825 million, in that case — in southern Lincoln County. Lawmakers rejected that prison pitch in February, an act that spurred the creation of Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset task force. Last week, Rhoden’s office said much of that investment was recaptured by reusing designs on the $650 million version that did earn approval, but $21 million of the money spent on the Lincoln County site is unrecoverable.
The state shaved $175 million off the cost of the Sioux Falls prison plan by shrinking common areas within the facility and designing 300 of the beds as a barracks. Rhoden said the new plan does not reduce rehabilitation and vocational programming space. 
Questions on how to pay for the ongoing operations of the new prison will greet lawmakers when they return in January for their regular session. 
Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko, who tendered an Oct. 20 resignation in a letter to Rhoden earlier this month in the face of criticism, told lawmakers earlier this year that it could cost the state up to $20 million more a year to run the new prison.
Two newer units on the grounds of the penitentiary in Sioux Falls will remain in service when the new building opens. That’s expected to happen in 2029.

Ian Calderon joins a crowd of Democrats jockeying in a wide-open race for governor. The former assemblymember left the Legislature in 2020 to focus on his family.


Former state lawmaker Ian Calderon is joining the crowded 2026 race for California governor, he announced Tuesday. 
The Whittier Democrat is framing his candidacy as one from a “new generation of leadership.” He was 27 when he became the first millennial to be elected to the state Assembly in 2012. 
But he was no newcomer even then — Calderon comes from a line of politicians from southeast Los Angeles County. His father, Charles Calderon, started the dynasty when he was elected to the Assembly in 1982. Two of his uncles also served in the Legislature — and federal prison for corruption. 
Ian Calderon left the Assembly, where he was majority leader, in 2020 to focus on his young family and his stepmother Lisa Calderon now holds his seat. But he’s been biding his time for a return.
In a campaign video that heavily features his wife and children, he said since leaving office he’s been “living in the real world, watching everyday life get harder for families like mine.” He highlighted the high costs of gas, child care and housing, taking particular aim at investment firms buying up properties. 
“The people running our government? They’re trying to use yesterday’s ideas to solve today’s problems and it isn’t working,” he said. 
He joins a crowd of Democrats jockeying in a wide-open race for the governorship, including: state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Controller Betty Yee, former state Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Rep. Katie Porter, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 
Republicans Chad Bianco, the sheriff of Riverside County, and commentator Steve Hilton also are running.

They’ll have to do it cutting services, laying off workers, and making the most difficult call to moms, dads, sisters, and brothers and tell them, ‘Sorry, we can no longer provide services to your loved one.'”
The state House and the state Senate passed dueling health care funding bills this week. Without an agreement, neither bill can become law.

The state Department of Health and Services warned last month that if it did not receive an increase in Medicaid funding, it would cut payment rates to a broad range of health care providers beginning Oct. 1. 
The agency said Tuesday that without the additional money, it is prepared to reduce payments.
DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai said in an emailed statement that the legislature must act to approve the funds.
“Just like any household budget, we must make decisions based on the resources we know are available, not those we hope to receive,” his statement said.  “And under North Carolina law, the state is required to maintain a balanced budget, meaning we cannot spend money knowing we will run out well before the end of the fiscal year. Without legislative action, health care providers will see reduced payments and North Carolinians will see reduced access to care. It is time to stop delaying and do what is right for the people of North Carolina.”
The rate cuts will devastate patients and workers, said Rep. Grant Campbell (R-Cabarrus).
“There are health care providers all over the state that are already planning on layoffs, and some are deciding whether to continue seeing Medicaid patients at all,” he said.
The Senate passed its bill Monday. Senate leader Phil Berger said his chamber is done voting for the week. 
The House passed its bill unanimously on Tuesday. 
Both the House and Senate bills would increase funds going to cover increased Medicaid costs. The legislature approved $600 million in a stop-gap budget bill it passed in July, which DHHS said is not enough. Both the House and Senate bills increase that amount to $690 million, with more for Medicaid administration. 
The big sticking point is that the Senate included the final installment for a children’s hospital and money for rural hospitals in its bill while the House did not. 
House Republicans wanted a “clean bill” without the hospital money. The House Republican caucus is questioning the need to build a children’s hospital when the state already has them, and wants to take back the money that’s already been approved, House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Lenior) told reporters.  
Duke Health and UNC Health have announced they will jointly run the hospital planned for Apex.

“Our members are asking questions of why is the state sending this money to two entities that already have a ton of it for a project the state may not necessarily need,” he said. “That’s part of our debate right now over the budget.”
The legislature has not passed a comprehensive budget that includes big items such as teacher and state employee raises. The budget year started July 1.
In a statement, Gov. Josh Stein lamented the lack of an agreement between the chambers. 
“With no agreement in sight to fully fund our Medicaid program, the General Assembly is closing off access to health care at a time when we need more,”  Stein’s  statement said. “Failure to act will lose us critical federal funding and take more than a billion dollars total out of our state’s health care system, needlessly hurting people’s health, health care providers, and our economy.”
Hall told reporters that DHHS does not have to cut rates next week. The legislature has already provided enough money to fund Medicaid into next year, he said.
Hall said Stein, a Democrat, is threatening Medicaid cuts for political reasons.
“It’s creating a fake crisis,” Hall said. “He certainly doesn’t have to do it.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4763-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

Ned Lamont walks with New London Mayor Michael Passero, right, and state Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, toward a press conference to celebrate the resumtion of work on the Revolution Wind project. (Photo by John Moritz/ CT Mirror)Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont took a victory lap in New London on Tuesday after a federal judge ordered work to resume on the Revolution Wind project, and he hinted that ongoing talks with the Trump administration could ease the path forward for both wind and fossil fuel projects in the region.
“We have a lot of catching up to do,” Lamont told reporters from a vantage point overlooking the staging area at the State Pier, which was jam-packed with sections of turbines ready to be loaded onto ships and taken out to sea for installation.
That installation work, which was shut down for nearly a month on the orders of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, is slated to restart as soon as Wednesday, Lamont said.
“When these wind turbines are spinning in less than a year, it’s going to bring down the price of electricity, because it brings down peak pricing during the winter months, which is the most expensive time,” Lamont said. “This is a big deal for business, so it’s good.”
Lamont was joined in New London by his counterpart in Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, along with a throng of union workers and state and local officials to celebrate Monday’s decision by U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, which lifted the stop-work order.
While the Trump administration may still appeal that decision, Lamberth did not stay his order — thus allowing work to resume immediately on the $6 billion project.
In a statement on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said that Lamberth’s ruling “will not be the final say on the matter.”
“President Trump was elected with a resounding mandate to end Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,” Kelly said.
Rather than gloating on their initial victory, however, both Lamont and McKee offered a conciliatory note to President Donald J. Trump, saying they were engaged in conversations with administration officials about a broader energy strategy for the New England region.
“We’re working very closely with the Trump administration,” Lamont said. “We’re doing everything it can, not just right here [in New London] but what we can do to add on additional energy across our region. That’s all the above, from my point of view.”
Lamont has repeatedly touted his relationships with two Trump administration figures in particular: Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. He met with both officials during a visit to Washington, D.C., in February during which he expressed an interest in working with the federal government to secure permits for an expansion of natural gas infrastructure and state-of-the-art nuclear reactors.
The governor also noted that a purported deal between officials in New York and the federal government, which would allow the construction of new gas pipelines, was widely seen as necessary to spare another wind project — Empire Wind — from cancellation by the Trump administration.
But in his efforts to negotiate a similar deal to save Revolution Wind, Lamont said his overtures were repeatedly met with silence. “Show me the ransom note,” was how he characterized those talks to reporters last week, before the judge granted an injunction, allowing work to resume.
And while Lamont suggested some progress was made in talks held over the weekend, he confirmed on Tuesday that federal officials have not made any explicit request for Connecticut to approve natural gas pipelines in order to get them to lift their opposition to Revolution Wind.
Lamont’s willingness to strike a deal with the Trump administration involving an expansion of natural gas pipelines also risks alienating environmental advocates, who see gas as a costly and polluting source of power generation.
“I don’t think more natural gas is an ‘all of the above’ strategy,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound. “We’re full up on natural gas. You know, it’s by far the majority of what’s powering our electricity grid in the region. Here in Connecticut, we use an awful lot of it for home heating, and that creates a conflict. That’s a conflict, particularly with winter reliability, that offshore wind… is ideally designed to meet.”
Still, Rothenberger said he did not see much downside to officials like Lamont retaining “cordial” relationships with the Trump administration.
In addition to the soon-to-be-installed components of the Revolution Wind development that were stacked up on the State Pier Tuesday, equipment for the developers’ next project — the even larger Sunrise Wind, which will send power to New York — were being staged in preparation for offshore construction.
Asked whether he feared retaliation from the Trump administration targeting that project, Rhode Island’s McKee said the states would act similarly to protect workers and sources of clean energy.
“Those battles could come our way, but we’re prepared to fight them,” McKee said.

(Photo by Jodi Hilton/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island pressed the House Committee on Appropriations Tuesday to reject a provision in one of its fiscal year 2026 budget proposals that would rename the new Workforce Pell Grants to “Trump Grants.”
Workforce Pell Grants are a new category of Pell Grant, the federal government’s need-based financial aid program for college undergraduates. After years of bipartisan efforts to institute the grants for short-term training that prepares students for specific, high skill industries, the Workforce Pell grants were signed into law via President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in July. 
A provision in the house appropriations bill introduced on Sept. 11 — one that covers the upcoming fiscal year’s budgets for the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education — would see the new grants renamed before they go into effect on July 1, 2026. 
The provision would not affect traditional Pell Grants, and the U.S. Senate’s equivalent of the House Appropriations bill lacks the “Trump Grants” provision. 
In a letter to Appropriations leadership, Amo and Magaziner argued the new nickname would erase the legacy of the late U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat and the namesake of the broader federal Pell Grant program which is often credited with scaffolding modern financial aid.  
“Preserving Senator Pell’s name on the program is not just about honoring the past, it is about protecting a future where every student, regardless of background, has the chance to dream big and achieve more,” the congressmen wrote. “To attempt to erase Senator Pell’s name from a program that has uplifted generations and replace it with a President whose record on education is defined by cuts and dismantlement is a profound insult to that legacy.”
Pell Grants began in 1972 when Pell led the charge to reform the Higher Education Act of 1965 and create Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, which were renamed in Pell’s honor in 1980. Pell Grants don’t require repayment and have a limited eligibility window. 
The new workforce grants carry the same conditions as other Pell offerings, and students cannot receive regular and workforce grants at the same time. The workforce grants — whose genesis goes back to 2014 with similar proposals in the JOBS Act by former Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu — are designed to subsidize students enrolled in accredited career-oriented programs that last between eight and 15 weeks. The OBBB defines eligible programs as ones offering instruction in “high-skill, high-wage” jobs or “in-demand industry sectors or occupations.”
Amo and Magaziner also took aim at the president’s venture into higher education, Trump University, which was open from 2005 to 2011 and was not an accredited university.
“It was not a university, it was not accredited, and it ultimately resulted in a $25 million settlement to resolve fraud claims brought by thousands of students who were misled by President Trump,” Amo and Magaziner wrote, adding that Trump’s higher ed effort “raise[s] questions about the appropriateness of associating the Trump name with a federal grant program designed to help working-class Americans achieve their higher education dreams.” 
“These grants should remain rooted in the legacy of Senator Pell, whose name symbolizes opportunity, integrity and the belief that education is the cornerstone of a strong democracy,” Amo and Magaziner wrote.

(Image via NPS)During the past two years, nonresident tourists visiting Montana spent an estimated $5.28 billion in the Treasure State annually, a roughly 9% decrease from the previous two years but one of the highest estimates on record.
That’s according to a new report by the Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research (ITRR) at the University of Montana, which examined nonresident spending during 2023 and 2024. Compared to the last two-year study, covering 2022 and 2023, average annual nonresident spending at gas stations, local restaurants, hotels and other tourism-oriented businesses decreased by roughly $540 million.
The latest data release tracks with an earlier report this year that showed Montana welcomed an all-time record number of tourists in 2024 — by a million — but saw a roughly 10% decrease in how much money those tourists spent in state.
Among the state’s five designated tourism regions, Glacier Country, comprising the western portion of Montana, saw a two-year average of $1.8 billion in annual nonresident spending, accounting for a third of all traveler expenditures, holding its position at the top. Yellowstone Country, which includes Bozeman, Big Sky, and Red Lodge was next with $1.3 billion in average annual spending.
The institute has collected nonresident spending data since 2009, giving researchers a long dataset to observe trends in spending habits. 
“It’s a consistent method we’ve been using for a very long time,” Kara Grau, the report’s author, said. “I feel good about the history of this data.”
The data is collected through in-person interviews with travelers, as well as data from secondary sources. Grau notes that while there is high confidence in the state-wide estimates, the modeling estimates for the region and county-level data is drawing from increasingly smaller pools of data, so there is more variation year-to-year. 
In the 2022-2023 report, Glacier Country and Yellowstone Country accounted for 33.6% and 23.4% of the state’s nonresident spending respectively. In the latest report, those proportions held steady, with 33% and 25% respectively, while the southwest region ticked up from 15% to 17%. 
Among counties, Gallatin County saw the highest annual average of $887.3 million in spending, while Flathead County was close behind with $850.3 million, down 8% and 15% respectively.
“They seem to just jockey for first and second position each year,” Grau said. “They’re relatively close in spending. They both have the big national parks right in their vicinity. I think the visitation to those parks is a big contributor to which county jumps into the first or second place spot.”
In 2022, Yellowstone National Park’s northern entrance and the Livingston area saw catastrophic floods which closed portions of the road for months, leading to a drastic drop in visitation that year. Grau said some of the increased visitation to Gallatin County and the Yellowstone Country region in the latest report can be attributed to Yellowstone being reopened for the full season. 
Twenty-seven Montana counties drew at least $20 million in out-of-state tourism-related spending.

  Gas, guides and gambling 

Gas and diesel was the top spending category statewide as well as in four travel regions in Montana — Glacier and Yellowstone’s travel regions saw spending in restaurants and bars take the number-one spot.  The two categories combined for 40% of traveler spending, followed by lodging at 22%.
Retail sales, a $413 million category for visitors in 2023 and 2024, showed a decrease in the latest report, as did some categories that capture snapshots of discretionary or high-budget expenditures. 
According to ITRR, roughly 5% of out-of-state visitors hire outfitters and guides, which accounted for $412 million in visitor expenditures, while tourists spending money in casinos accounted for $27 million, both declines from the previous year.
 


“I do think in 2024 we saw a little less spending on the more flexible kinds of spending that travelers do, in terms of ‘I’ll spend more on groceries and less on going out to eat.’” Grau said, also highlighting the declines in retail and guiding services. 
One spending category that bucked the trend was money spent on Made in Montana products, a separate category from regular retail expenses for products carrying a Department of Commerce designation as locally sourced. The ITRR questionnaire didn’t ask about locally-sourced products in its first few iterations, but as the state has emphasized products made or grown in the state it has emerged as a profitable economic sector that keeps growing. 
Visitors spent an average of $184 million on Made in Montana products in 2023 and 2024, up more than $20 million from the previous years.

Electricity demand in western states is projected to increase 20% during the next decade — double what has been expected, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Monday.
“It’s clear we’ve got to meet this challenge head on to secure affordable, reliable energy for Montana families and businesses,” Gianforte said.
At their initial meeting Monday, the governor asked members of his newly formed energy task force to “dig deep, be creative, cast a wide net.” He asked the group to explore groundbreaking technologies for the state, including nuclear.
Gianforte created the Energy Advisory Council in a Sept. 10 executive order to provide him with short- and long-term recommendations to increase the supply of affordable and reliable energy.
In general, Gianforte said he was tasking the group with providing “actionable” recommendations to “unleash American made energy.”
He said Montana has an “historic opportunity” to make progress with President Donald Trump back in the White House.
The task force, a group of 20 industry representatives, energy experts, large consumers, and legislators, asked how much more energy generation Montana needs, how much transmission capacity is available, and how to turn the page on “negative press” about data centers.
Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski, chairperson of the task force, said generation has changed in Montana in recent years.
It has more energy capacity but less generation, with the closures of two coal fired plants at Colstrip and opening of “more variable resources,” such as wind, according to her presentation.
Data in the presentation said since 2019, wind capacity has increased 162% and wind generation has increased 93.6%.
But Nowakowski said demand is up even as generation is down — “We need to do something about that.”
And she said not much has changed with transmission in recent years.
Nowakowski said the group had significant expertise, it would have hard conversations during the next year, and she encouraged members to continually think about pushing the Treasure State forward.
“How can we make Montana first? I’m competitive. I want Montana to be first,” Nowakowski said.
She also said she wanted U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and others at the national level “to know Montana is ready and open for business.”
In response to a question from state Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, about whether reducing demand was part of the discussion, Nowakowski said “everything is on the table,” including energy efficiency.
“The cheapest electron is the one we save,” Nowakowski said.
Just one person appeared to have offered public comment, a written remark a task force member read aloud.
The person said they thought the makeup of task force members leaned toward those who favored fossil fuels and asked the group to consider including representation from the Montana Environmental Information Center.
Nowakowski, however, said the group’s charge in making recommendations included “fuel neutrality,” and she said the governor also had promoted an “all of the above” strategy for energy.
She outlined three topics task force subgroups would focus on — energy generation; growing demand; and transmission and markets.
The themes all three subgroups would consider are consumer perspectives, governance, regional markets, and best practices and innovation.
Gianforte said Montana already is a leader when it comes to energy resources and generation, and it’s ready to do more for producers and consumers, and for affordability and security.
“With our abundant resources and outstanding potential, Montana can and should play a key role in unleashing American energy,” Gianforte said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Tax Department estimates the state’s income tax collections will take a sizable hit as a result of federal tax legislation, though the impact will be smaller than in many other states.
Matt Peyerl, associate director of tax administration for the department, told lawmakers on Tuesday to expect an estimated $129 million reduction in individual and corporate tax income collections during the 2025-27 budget cycle due to the 10-year budget reconciliation law.
That equates to approximately 9% of the state’s individual and business income taxes and 2.5% of the state’s total tax and fee revenues collected in the 2023-25 biennium. 
The reduction in income tax collection is expected to decrease to $93 million in the 2027-29 biennium, according to the tax department’s estimates, before falling off to $26 million in the 2029-31 biennium when many of the changes expire. 
“A lot of the individual changes fall off after four years,” Peyerl said. 
That leaves a lot of uncertainty when trying to project farther than four years out because Congress could choose to extend the changes. Even estimates for the next few years are dependent on a lot of variables. 
“For now they’re the best I have,” Peyerl told members of the Legislature’s interim Tax Reform and Relief Advisory Committee. 
He said there will be some clarity on the impact to state revenues in summer 2026 once the majority of this year’s tax returns are filed. 
Peyerl noted the impact on North Dakota is anticipated to be less than more populous states with higher tax rates and a lower percentage of the population falling into a “zero bracket,” where they pay no income tax. In North Dakota, residents don’t pay state income tax if they make less than $48,475 for single filers, or $80,975 for married couples.  
Some states will see impacts from the federal legislation in the hundreds of millions or nearly $1 billion, Peyerl said.
For North Dakota, the largest impacts to individual income tax will come from the exemption for overtime pay, the increased standard deduction that applies to all filers, an additional $6,000 tax deduction for some senior citizens, and the deduction for auto loan interest payments up to $10,000. 
Business tax revenues will be reduced by restoring corporations’ pre-2023 ability to expense bonus depreciation, as well as research and development costs. 
While these changes were made at the federal level, and not by the North Dakota Legislature, it will nonetheless affect the state’s tax collections.
“North Dakota is entirely coupled, for better or for worse,” Peyerl said, with the federal government’s system.
That means North Dakota conforms to the federal Internal Revenue Code, including any changes made by the U.S. Congress, unless the state’s lawmakers pass a law stating otherwise. 
“Most of the states are in similar positions where to one extent or another they’re tied to the federal system,” Peyerl said. “Some are more completely tied. Some are tied in between.”
Not all federal tax legislation affects North Dakota’s tax collections. Changes to tax credits, for example, don’t have an effect on how much revenue North Dakota receives.

(Photo by Katrina Liebich/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The U.S. Government does not have a good grasp on the federally-funded research needs for advancing U.S. national interests in the Arctic. That became clear to me when the U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC) recently published a new report that was intended to articulate those needs. In seeking alignment with the America First Agenda of the Trump Administration, USARC chose the wrong concept for our national interests. Perhaps inadvertently, USARC reduced our national interests to nothing more than our national safety and security interests. That is clear when one considers the terminology used throughout the report. Every priority area that USARC selected for Arctic research ends with the word “security” (e.g., military security). The Congressional committees of jurisdiction should resolutely reject the USARC findings in the months ahead. Otherwise, the U.S. Government will run the risk of prioritizing a set of research needs that do not fully advance the national interests of the Arctic, Alaskans and the American people.
Missing interests
One of the problems is that the USARC report frames the needs for Arctic research along a single dimensional plane. There is no doubt that national safety and national security are two of the national interests at play in the Arctic affairs of the United States. However, they are not the only national interests. There is also  national survival, as well as national identity. It is therefore remarkable that the USARC report not only overlooks the need for Arctic research on the preservation of the cultures, languages, history, and values of the Alaskans, especially Alaska Native peoples. It overlooks the need for Arctic research on the ability of the environment to meet the basic needs that ensure the enduring physical survival of Arctic communities.
Missing sectors
Another of the problems is that the USARC report frames the needs for Arctic research around only three of the five sectors of security. It is clear that there are economic issues, military issues, and societal issues that have become securitized in the Arctic affairs of the United States. However, they are not the only securitized issues. There are political issues that have become securitized, like immigration. That is evident in the framing of unlawful migration as an “invasion” by the Trump Administration. There are also environmental issues that some Americans argue should be securitized. Examples include climate change, environmental degradation, and cross-border pollution. That is evident in the framing of climate change as an “existential threat” by the Biden Administration. It is therefore remarkable that the USARC report did not explicitly address what, if any, needs there are for research on political and environmental security. That includes the need for research on Ukrainian refugees residing in the State of Alaska. Or the need for research on the environmental threats to certain Alaska Native villages that are now forced to relocate. The former is a particularly glaring omission given that U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) is on-the-record calling for the Trump Administration to do more to protect Ukrainian refugees.
National plan
The Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC), in cooperation with USARC, is in the process of developing a new multi-year national plan for Arctic research. That document will provide the guidelines that various federal agencies will use to determine where to invest their portion of federal funds to area studies, engineering, science, and technology research related to the Arctic. In order to advance U.S. national interests in Arctic affairs, the National Plan for Arctic Research (2027-2031) should avoid making the same mistakes as the USARC report. That will require doing a couple of things differently. First, it will need to account for each and every critical security issue that has an impact on U.S. national interests in the Arctic. That includes politically uncomfortable ones (e.g., environmental security issues). Second, it will need to articulate a set of priority areas that advance U.S. national interests – not simply U.S. national security interests. Otherwise, there will be major gaps in federally-funded research that will undermine U.S. national interests in the Arctic and beyond.
Alaska nexus
A large number of Arctic research institutions are based in the State of Alaska. This becomes immediately clear when one considers the member institutions of the soon to be shuttered Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS). They include the Alaska Ocean Observing System, Kawerak, Inc., Sitka Sound Science Center, University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and University of Alaska Southeast. These member institutions have been conducting Arctic research that not only improves our general understanding of Alaska and its communities. They have been producing research that has a tangible impact on the everyday lives of the people of Alaska. 
If the U.S. government decides to deprioritize federal funding of research on the stewardship of the Alaskan environment or community health for Alaskans, it could not only have a significant impact on livelihoods of Arctic researchers across the State of Alaska. That decision could have a significant impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of Alaskan residents. That is why Alaskans should be questioning the Congressional delegation of Alaska and where they stand on oversight actions and the needs for Arctic research in the months ahead. Otherwise, they could miss the policy window that is now open to advance the interests of Alaska through Arctic research.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/32597688296_22a9433c96_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The U.S. Department of Agriculture has canceled a report that hunger-fighting organizations say was “essential” data to see the results of federal and local policies aimed at ending hunger. 
USDA, in a news release about the decision said the reports were “redundant, costly, politicized” and did “nothing more than fear monger.”
Paige Chickering, vice chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, said agencies like hers, along with researchers and even politicians, used the now-canceled report to analyze the impact of certain policies on food insecurity. Chickering said the announced cancellation of the report coincides with the “largest cut” to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
“That can’t just be coincidence,” Chickering said. “That seems very intentional, because it is very likely that the cuts will make it harder for Americans, and Iowans, to access their grocery benefits, and we will very likely see that in the data about food security – except now we won’t, because it’s no longer being collected.”

The Republican-led budget reconciliation law,  enacted July 4 and known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” included significant cuts to the SNAP program. 
According to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the law cut $187 billion, or about 20%, of federal funding to SNAP through 2034.  CBO said the law “takes away food assistance” via its changes to the Thrifty Food Plan, requirements for some states to provide matching funds, expanded work requirements and changes to eligibility based on immigration status. The CBO report estimates 4 million people that rely on SNAP will see their food assistance terminated, or reduced substantially. 
The Iowa Hunger Coalition estimates the changes to the program from the new law will result in a loss of nearly $50 million in funding to SNAP in Iowa in 2026. By 2034, the loss of funding per fiscal year will be more than $200 million, according to the coalition. 
“Millions of American children are facing food insecurity, and willfully neglecting that fact, and preventing the federal government from collecting and reporting the data that tells us how many kids are impacted is frankly unacceptable,” said Chickering, who is also the Iowa state manager for the Save the Children Action Network.
What is the Household Food Security Report?
The USDA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Center for Health Statistics partnered in the 1990s to create a supplement to the Current Population Survey, known as the CPS Food Security Supplement. 
This supplement, which has been issued annually since 1995, gathers data for a national measure of food security. Data from the report is used to generate Household Food Security Reports.
According to the news release from USDA announcing the termination of the project, the study was initiated under the Clinton administration as a “means to support the increase of SNAP eligibility and benefit allotments.” 
USDA called the survey “redundant” in the release and said it “failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder.” 
The food security survey is one of several elements used by Feeding America, a national organization of food banks, pantries and meal programs, for its reports on hunger in America. The latest report shows 47 million people in the nation face food insecurity, and that 1 in 5 children is food insecure. 
Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, Feeding America’s CEO, said in a statement that the loss of the survey “will create gaps.” Babineaux-Fontenot said while the survey was never a “a perfect resource,” it has revealed trends and highlighted the experiences of children and households experiencing food insecurity.
“They helped us to see that food insecurity touches every county in every state and that the deepest challenges are often in rural counties,” Babineaux-Fontenot said. 
She said the report also showed when certain issues like the “staggering inflation” of 2022 left people “reeling” or when policies, like the investments into nutrient-dense local foods in late 2020, had positive outcomes on food security rates and health outcomes. 
“While neither the USDA report nor any single report that is created will be perfect, these efforts help ensure the information we collect and act on is as accurate and useful as possible,” Babineaux-Fontenot said. 
“As USDA’s report sunsets, there is a risk of losing consistent national benchmarks that have helped guide solutions. Feeding America is committed to working alongside partners to ensure we continue building on that foundation.” 
USDA said in its release that “trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged” despite increases to SNAP spending from 2019-2023. 
Chickering said that claim is “not true” and cited Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap study which shows food insecurity rates nationally have increased more than 3% in the last two years. 
“They’ve not remained the same; they are actually on the rise,” Chickering said. “And then we also see strong anecdotal evidence of this as well when we talk about what food banks and food pantries are experiencing … they’re experiencing higher and higher demand.” 
USDA’s own survey results from September 2024, reflecting 2023 data from the survey, also show a sharp increase in food insecurity rates from 2021 to 2023.

Share Our Strength, another organization that uses the food security data with its No Kid Hungry campaign, said Americans should be “deeply concerned” about the elimination of the survey.
Anne Filipic, the organization’s CEO, said in a statement the data has been used to “illuminate how policy decisions impact how children and families across America experience hunger.” 
“By helping policymakers and advocates understand the impact policy decisions and the economy have on hunger trends, this research helps ensure we’re wisely investing taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively on programs that work to end hunger,” Filipic said in a statement.
Chickering said the announcement from USDA insinuates the report is “costing American taxpayers a ton of money” which she said is misleading since the survey is a supplement to the existing Current Population Survey. 
“We get a ton of data out of this report that’s foundational to the study of food insecurity in our country at a very low cost to the government,” Chickering said.

Josh Shapiro.","Constellation Energy's Limerick Generating Station, branded as the Limerick Clean Energy Center, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The organization that manages the electric grid for all or part of 13 states, including Maryland, has moved too slowly in response to skyrocketing energy demand and consumers are paying for it, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday.
Speaking at a conference of energy industry leaders and regulators in Philadelphia, Shapiro said PJM Interconnection must make changes, including giving states a bigger role in its governance, or the commonwealth could leave the consortium.
“We need to be thinking about consumers and their costs, something that PJM, I think, doesn’t really spend a whole lot of time focused on,” Shapiro told reporters Monday after delivering opening remarks at the event.
He said governors from each PJM state share concerns about the Valley Forge-based organization’s backlog of new energy projects awaiting approval while peak energy consumption is expected to increase by 20% in the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast. Much of that demand will come from data centers that house the computing power for artificial intelligence.
“We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects. We’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” Shapiro said.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who spoke via video, said overhauling the state’s power policy was among his first calls for action after taking office in 2022. Youngkin, a Republican, said his administration predicted demand would grow faster than PJM’s forecast.
“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said. “This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence.”
Youngkin said Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation that would allow the state to reassess whether its utilities should remain part of PJM.
“This doesn’t mean that we are walking away, but it does mean that collectively, we recognize we need to represent and protect our ratepayers, and that means sending a clear, unified signal that PJM must modernize,” he said.
PJM was founded in Philadelphia nearly a century ago when three electricity utilities connected their independent grids to share resources and improve reliability. With more than 1,000 stakeholder members, it now ensures the flow of power to utilities in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois and the New York border to North Carolina.
It is overseen by a board of governors through a consensus-based issue resolution process in which member organizations and stakeholders have weighted votes on issues that will go before the board. These include state consumer advocate organizations, like Pennsylvania’s Public Utilities Commission, but the states themselves have no direct input.
The board’s decisions are ultimately subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
While PJM’s stakeholder process and meetings are open to the public with agendas and minutes posted on its website, members of the public are required to register for an account to watch meetings virtually. And while the outcome of votes is public, critics have compared it to a black box, because how stakeholders vote on questions is secret.
Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report their votes to state regulators. They include a bill introduced by Pennsylvania state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), which passed in the House in July and awaits action in the Senate.
“Utility companies operating in our regional power grid that determine the electric bills, environmental and public health of 65 million people should never be allowed to vote in secret,” Rabb said. “Such decisions must be publicly disclosed. End of story.”

PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is set to step down at the end of this year, said he’s proud of the reliability that PJM has provided through a series of unusual events during his tenure, including record peak demands, a pandemic, geomagnetic storms and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which threatened a major transmission line.
Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted.
“There’s a lot of mythology and a lot of things that are said about our interconnection queue,” he said, noting that number is down from 200,000 megawatts when the organization implemented reforms in 2023. PJM also notes that it has cleared tens of thousands of megawatts worth of projects that have failed to come online for reasons outside of its control, including site acquisition, permitting and supply chain problems.
PJM has also worked proactively with members to prioritize important projects, such as restarting Constellation Energy’s former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, and redeveloping Homer City, one of the nation’s largest coal power plants, into the nation’s largest natural gas-burning power stations. Both projects will power data centers.
Experts who spoke during panels at the conference agreed with Shapiro, Youngkin and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who also spoke via video, that PJM is not serving consumers well.
“You’ve got 67 million people who are very concerned, and again, consumers are called voters, and that makes the politicians concerned,” said former FERC Chairman Mark Christie. Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements were recommended by a bipartisan panel of PJM-state governors to fill vacancies on the board, but neither was ultimately nominated.
“PJM should be reimagined in the governance sense,” Christie said, adding that he wouldn’t interfere with the technical aspects of operating the grid. “The policymaking things that PJM does in their political policy, if it’s going to be a regional government for the grid, people who are elected will have a much bigger role in that.”
Vincent Duane, a former senior vice president and general counsel at PJM, said changes need to go deeper than simply giving elected officials a bigger role.

“​​I’m going to be blunt and unpopular when I say that PJM has become ungovernable,” Duane said “Adding seats to an already crowded banquet table with 1,000 parliamentarians with vastly different interests, I think, is going to ultimately leave states feeling disappointed with the outcomes.”
What’s missing is more purposeful and deliberate decision making from a strong executive branch in the organization that is accountable to state utility regulators, he said.
Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility. He said he had trouble answering the question. To say the responsibility was to the marketplace or membership was unsatisfactory.
“Until we can get a good answer to that question, it’s premature to start talking about process and voting structures,” Duane said.
Maryland State Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said the question of fiduciary duty is an important one for the success of policies that elected officials create.
“The vast majority of the stakeholders know who their fiduciary duty is to, and it is to their shareholders,” Charkoudian said, adding that for ratepayers that amounts to a wealth transfer to the market participants who are writing the rules.
“You could go example after example after example, where that is the case,” she said. “And that is why it’s untenable to continue at this moment with this governance structure.”

The board discussed its options on the two president openings during a closed executive session Tuesday when it met on the Minot State University campus. 
Simone, previously CEO and dean at Dakota College at Bottineau, was appointed as interim president in May. She took over for longtime Lake Region President Doug Darling, who retired June 30.
Board Chair Kevin Black said the difference in the two openings was that Simone had already gone through a rigorous vetting process when she was a finalist for the Dickinson State University president’s post. That position went to Scott Molander. Simone has also held other top leadership positions at other campuses.
Black encouraged Leingang to apply for the Bismarck State presidency. The position opened when Doug Jensen left abruptly in January.

The board also is wrestling with updating its policies on when a search is required for leadership posts. It chose to not conduct a search before naming Brent Sanford as the University System’s commissioner Tuesday. It also did not conduct a search for the Lake Region presidency. 
The board without discussion advanced a first reading of a policy change that removes a requirement for the board to conduct a presidential search. A committee will work on refining the policy before it comes back to the board for further consideration. 
Lisa Montplaisir, faculty representative to the board, said the search policies and practices have been a hot topic with faculty this year. 
“Our hope is that we have the opportunity to provide input,” Montplaisir, who teaches at North Dakota State University, said after the meeting. 
University of North Dakota President Andy Armacost said in an interview that a national search is the norm at the college for positions such as vice president and dean. 
UND is searching for a dean of its law school and its College of Business and Public Administration. 
“There might be times when we go away from that (national search) standard,” Armacost said.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday joined a private prison company in its legal fight with Leavenworth city officials, accusing the city of “aggressive and unlawful” interference with immigration enforcement.
The DOJ filed a statement of interest in the case in U.S. District Court, signed by the assistant U.S. attorney general’s office.
“The United States has a strong interest in countering state and local efforts to harass federal contractors, in the proper application of the Constitution and its Supremacy Clause, and in the foundational principles that protect the Federal Government from unconstitutional state and local interference,” the filing said.
A statement of interest authorizes the U.S. attorney general to become a non-party in a suit pending in any court in the country, the filing said.
CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth have been fighting in court for months over the city’s requirement that CoreCivic go through its development process to receive a special use permit before reopening its prison facility at 100 Highway Terrace.
Nashville-based CoreCivic announced in March that it would reopen the prison facility, which closed in 2021, to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.
CoreCivic and the city have a hearing scheduled Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Topeka as part of an appeal of a Kansas court’s decision barring CoreCivic from housing ICE detainees while the case about the development permit is being heard.
CoreCivic has alleged in multiple filings that Leavenworth officials are violating the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and interfering with the operations of the federal government. That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
The U.S. government’s statement Tuesday pushed that argument forward, saying that it is “especially true” in relationship to immigration. 
“Defendants have violated the Supremacy Clause by attempting to stymie the Federal Government’s immigration-related operations at 100 Highway Terrace,” the federal filing said, citing multiple cases to support its arguments that federal contractors are free from state control.
“This well-settled principle has been consistently applied to invalidate state and local laws that impose requirements on federal contractors,” the filing said. 
The city’s efforts to prevent CoreCivic from housing immigration detainees at its prison, recently renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center, is an attempt to regulate the federal government’s efforts to house detainees at that facility and violates the supremacy clause, the filing said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CoreCivic-MRRC-sign-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman and GOP attorneys general from 25 other states are supporting a Trump administration move to rescind a finding that underpins the federal government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. 
The attorneys general submitted the letter, led by Coleman and West Virginia Attorney General John “JB” McCuskey, Monday to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The letter supports the Trump EPA’s proposal to reverse the agency’s previous finding that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide threaten “both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” 
The 2009 “endangerment” finding established under the Obama administration has served as the legal basis for a number of federal regulations seeking to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including a 2024 Biden administration rule that restricted tailpipe emissions from vehicles. The finding followed a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the agency could regulate greenhouse gases as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. 
Coleman in a statement provided through a press release Tuesday highlighting the 88-page letter said the “unlawful” EPA finding “has been the justification for assaults on Kentucky.” 
“Along with AGs across the country, we’re partnering with President Trump to preserve affordable and reliable energy in Kentucky and to stop the madness that has hiked prices and killed jobs,” Coleman said. 
The press release from Coleman’s office also stated the EPA finding has underpinned “some of the worst policies of the last decades,” citing the Clean Power Plan that curbs carbon emissions from existing power plants and federal electric vehicle “mandates.”
The letter questions the near unanimous scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are driving the warming of the Earth’s climate. 
“[C]limate science didn’t support the Endangerment Finding in 2009, and the science has only gotten worse for EPA’s original finding since then,” the attorneys general wrote in the letter’s introduction. 
The letter claims increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would “have only a trivial effect on global temperature,” citing physicists Steven Koonin, Richard Lindzin and William Happer who have questioned climate science and the threat of climate change. 
Vic Maddox, counsel on special litigation for Kentucky’s attorney general, cited Lindzin and Happer in testimony to state lawmakers that carbon dioxide’s role in climate change was disputed.
The letter is co-signed by attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body, in a 2021 report stated humans’ role in climate change was “unequivocal” and connected climate change to an increasing frequency of heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall events, stronger hurricanes and other extreme weather. 
A number of environmental and health advocacy groups are urging the EPA to keep the endangerment finding. The American Lung Association and other health organizations wrote that people’s health would suffer if “life-saving pollution controls are left on the manufacturing floor and the overwhelming scientific consensus — and the law — on climate change is ignored.” 
Byron Gary, an attorney for the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council, told the Lantern he had not reviewed the letter from the attorneys general. But he said a reversal of the endangerment finding by the EPA would lead to relying further on “aging fossil infrastructure” that would increase energy costs, reduce energy reliability and exacerbate climate change. 
Gary pointed to an article published this month in the British weekly scientific journal Nature that found the health impacts of smoke from increased wildfires driven by climate change could lead to tens of thousands of increased deaths. 
“These are real effects on people’s lives. They are going to be killing people if this is repealed,” Gary said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_032-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority on Tuesday announced it has decided to move a controversial new turnpike route about two miles to the west.
The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority’s top priority when setting the new Norman-area turnpike route was minimizing the impact on people’s homes, said Joe Echelle, executive director.
“It was especially important to us that the new alignment avoid populated subdivisions, section line roads and dense development,” he said.
Engineers also looked closely at  environmental considerations such as floodplains, municipal use plans and existing utilities, he said.
Officials have been looking for a new corridor after the original route, dubbed the South Extension Turnpike, had to be revised when the U.S. Bureau of Land Reclamation determined the corridor proposed in 2022 was not compatible with the designated federal uses on Lake Thunderbird land in Norman.
The new route will eventually connect interstates 35 and 40, which supporters say will alleviate traffic congestion on I-35.
The new alignment starts at Indian Hills Road and runs south between 48th Street and 60th Avenue through Norman. It continues south past Oklahoma Highway 9. In the Noble area, the alignment will cross U.S. Highway 77 followed by the Canadian River before connecting with Interstate 35 north of Purcell.
Construction is anticipated to begin in 2027, with the northern portion of the South Extension Turnpike opening in 2032. The southern portion, from Oklahoma Highway 9 to Interstate 35, is expected to open in 2034. 
The new alignment is expected to impact about 75 homes, the same number as the original plan, said Trenton January, Oklahoma Turnpike Authority chief engineer.  
“Once we get closer to the 60% design phase, we will be able to be more accurate with homeowners and property owners about exactly what properties will be needed to develop the corridor,” January said.
The number of homes needed is subject to change, said Ladan Nelson, program manager.
“The Turnpike Authority is committed to negotiating all the way to the courthouse, even after it goes to condemnation, we continue to try to negotiate a settlement,” Echelle said.
Echelle said he didn’t think any schools or businesses would be impacted.
The cost of the route will be over $1 billion, which is about the same as the original, Nelson said.
Shortly after the new route was unveiled, several area lawmakers criticized it.
Democratic state lawmakers Mary Boren, Jared Deck, Annie Menz and Jacob Rosecrants issued a joint statement.
“Today’s announcement by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority casts a renewed cloud of uncertainty and fear over yet another 25,000 acres of homes, farms and ranches in Cleveland and McClain counties,” the Norman legislators said. “Once again, thousands of Oklahomans are being forced to live under the looming threat of displacement, and without a clear, evidence-based justification.”
The four Democrats called it a “flawed and corrupt process.”
Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, said she would work on legislation to bring more accountability and transparency to the Turnpike Authority.
“Turnpike expansion that is approved in the past and not moved upon until decades later is not acceptable,” she said, referring to prior legislative approval of the proposed turnpike. 
The new turnpike is part of a 15-year pike improvement and expansion plan, dubbed ACCESS, which originally carried a price tag of $5 billion. The new cost is $8.2 billion due to inflation, officials said.

(Getty Images)As New Mexico lawmakers prepare to convene next week in part to address the federal spending bill’s impact on Medicaid, legislative analysts say the state’s costs for the program have nearly doubled in nine years, even as enrollment has dropped. In addition, clients report ongoing issues with doctor availability.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts presented their report to lawmakers during an interim committee meeting on Tuesday in Hobbs. Overall, the report says, the state’s Health Care Authority since 2016 has nearly doubled total spending on Medicaid — to $11 billion — despite serving 31,000 fewer New Mexicans.
The report also includes the results of a secret shopper survey from August, which backs up anecdotal concerns regarding long wait lists and difficulty securing appointments. Analysts called 256 primary care physicians and 259 doctors to seek behavioral health care appointments under Medicaid, and found it took an average of six phone calls to secure an appointment. Nearly one in five doctors listed on directories from insurance companies could no longer be found or were “inappropriate for the specialty.”  Another 17% of providers either did not return calls or could not be reached.
Financial analyst Allegra Hernandez noted that Medicaid represents the state’s most vulnerable populations: low-income people, pregnant women, children and people with behavioral health issues.
“The systems are not improving for users in the way that we would expect and hope with these investments,” Hernandez said. “Moreover, spending has increased significantly, and these payoffs are not yet demonstrated to have shown up.”
Finally, analysts said the state still is not tracking, in real time, what services patients are using.
In a rebuttal, Health Care Authority Chief Medical Officer Alanna Dancis told lawmakers that some of the measures in the report are “a little bit misleading,” saying that the analysis in the report does not align with any other accountability measures requested by the federal government or lawmakers.
“We just would like to work together to kind of pick how we’re evaluated from the front end so that we have our best chance of being successful,” Dancis said.
Dancis said the agency has added nearly 2,000 new providers, including 469 new behavioral health workers and 189 new licensed therapists, based on new state laws passed by lawmakers, and that rising costs of the program in recent years were anticipated.
“We’re right where we expect to be after so much growth,” Dancis said.
As such, Dancis disputed the survey conclusions that the program has inadequate providers.   While “we can all agree that six calls is too many calls to make to try to schedule an appointment,” she said, better provider directories might address the issue.
New Mexico has the highest per-capita enrollment in Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people, amounting to about 38% of the state, according to the state’s latest data. The New Mexico Health Care Authority estimates that more than 80,000 New Mexicans could lose coverage due to the new work requirements and reregistering every six months beginning in December of 2026.
While the Health Care Authority is expected to ask lawmakers for additional administrative funding in anticipation of federal cuts, Charles Sallee, director of the Legislative Finance Committee, urged caution later in the day during a presentation on the federal impacts.
The HCA will ask for more funding to administer new work requirements and evaluate eligibility for assistance programs every six months, Sallee said. But he noted, per an LFC analysis, that state employees’ caseloads for food stamps, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families are down 21% since before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lawmakers should be prudent during the special session, he said, in light of how much non-recurring spending lawmakers have already allocated for the upcoming 30-day session and with fears about a looming federal government shutdown.
“I worry about spending that down before you get into the regular session, to be perfectly honest with you, because I think we’re facing headwinds economically,” he said. “And I worry about what that what the next couple of months are going to entail, just from our broader-based economic prosperity.”
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Albuquerque) spoke of her own challenges in securing appointments with doctors and specialists in the state and asked if the state has any data for how doctors may be leaving practices or the state altogether.
Harry Rommel, a fiscal analyst, said the LFC is working to track physician migration, but said the New Mexico Department of Health still hasn’t granted the committee access to a database tracking payments to doctors, but when that happens the state can find out if physicians are moving to private practices, or leaving the New Mexico altogether.
“That’s a missing link to figure out what’s really happening out there,” Trujillo said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Iowa’s place in national rankings dropped out of the top 100 for the first time in its history of being included in the U.S. News and World annual report as its fellow state universities and some private colleges climbed.
No matter where they landed in the rankings, many of Iowa’s universities touted student enrollment and retention rates as true signs of strength.
More than 1,700 U.S. colleges and universities are included in the 2026 U.S. News Best Colleges rankings, according to a U.S. News & World article announcing the rankings. Universities’ placement within the different ranking categories were determined by anywhere from 13 to 17 factors, the media company stated online, including different graduation and retention rates, peer assessments, faculty numbers and pay and more.

State universities
The University of Iowa lost its spot in the top 100 national universities for the first time since its launch at rank 57 on the list in 2004, falling from number 98 to 102 out of 436 and tying with seven other universities.
Its rankings for specific programs, including writing, undergraduate nursing and insurance, are all in the top 10 for this year, according to a news release from the UI, and is tied at 49th place for top public schools.
Of that top 50, the release stated the UI is one of only five universities to admit more than 80% of its applicants. UI President Barbara Wilson said in the release the university’s achievement of nearly 91% retention while still “admitting broadly” is a sign its mission is being fulfilled.
“The University of Iowa offers a world-class education while remaining accessible to every college-ready student,” Wilson said. “We are proud of the recognition, but even more proud of the real results we deliver for students and for the state of Iowa.”
Iowa State University climbed four spots in its national university ranking, going from 121st to a tie for 117th place. The Ames university placed 57th among top public schools, but its undergraduate engineering programs tied for 50th and biological and agricultural areas reached the number-one slot.
While not ranked in the same categories as the UI and ISU, the University of Northern Iowa has taken second place among top public regional universities in the Midwest, a continuing trend according to a news release from the Cedar Falls university.
UNI moved up one spot to 10th in the overall category for Midwest regional universities, according to the release, and was named the fourth-best college for veterans.
“These rankings annually reaffirm the many reasons why students across the Midwest are choosing UNI,” said UNI Director of University Relations Pete Moris in the release. “Whether it’s the high quality of our academic programs or the exceptional value we provide families, UNI continues to be recognized as one of the top public institutions in the Midwest.”
Private universities
Dordt University in Sioux Center is the only Iowa university to outrank UNI in the list of best Midwest regional universities, moving up one slot to fifth this year, according to a news release from the college. The institution also earned a #5 ranking in the best value category, and was ranked second for best undergraduate teaching.
Greg Van Dyke, Dordt University vice president for admissions, said in the release the rankings affirm the university’s growth and efforts to prepare students for careers and “lives of impact.”
“Being recognized by a respected organization like U.S. News & World Report is encouraging, but our focus remains clear: we exist to equip students to work for Christ-centered renewal in every area of life,” said Dordt President Erik Hoekstra in the release. “Rankings like these are affirming, but ultimately, we’re here for Christ and to help our students plug into His Kingdom purpose.”
Drake University in Des Moines ranks the highest out of Iowa’s private institutions included in the national universities category at #183, followed by Clarke University in Dubuque and St. Ambrose University in Davenport, both tied for 352nd place. Briar Cliff University in Sioux City ranks 384th.
Of the Iowa universities included in the national liberal arts colleges list, Grinnell College comes out on top — moving up six slots to 13th place in the ranking. The university, located in Grinnell, also came in third for undergraduate teaching, another six-spot climb, as well as earning 8th place for best value schools and 13th for most innovative schools.
Also ranked in the national liberal arts college category are Luther College in Decorah at 111th, Cornell College in Mount Vernon at 121st, Coe College at 126th, Central College in Pella at 131st and Wartburg College in Waverly at 156th place.
According to a news release from Grinnell College, these rankings come from the college’s “strong graduation rates for Pell-eligible students, as well as outperforming U.S. News’ predictive model for graduation rates.”
“These recognitions underscore Grinnell’s enduring commitment to academic excellence and college access,” said Grinnell College President Anne Harris in the release. “Our progress in areas like innovation, teaching, and social mobility reflects the strength of a Grinnell education—one that combines vibrant intellectual experience with campus community support, preparing our students to thrive and deepening our investment in every student’s success.”

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Projected tax collections in Washington continue to fall steeply, with declines totaling more than $500 million since the governor signed off on billions of dollars in tax increases earlier this year to help balance the budget.
Estimates shared with officials Tuesday show receipts for the current two-year state budget tumbling $412 million further from what was forecast three months ago. Incorporating the previous forecast from June, this puts the total slide over half-a-billion dollars. 
The troubling report from Dave Reich, the state’s chief economist, to the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council sets the stage for another legislative session marred by tough budget decisions, with the potential for further cuts to state services and higher taxes.
Sen. June Robinson, the lead budget writer in the Senate, said it’s “all bad news” that will make figuring out a supplemental budget plan next year “that much harder.”
With months until the next legislative session begins in January, it’s still early, but Robinson said lawmakers “may look at tax levers” again.
“We did take significant steps in that direction, those haven’t all played out, so I’m not sure there will be a big appetite to do a lot in the revenue space,” said Robinson, D-Everett, in an interview. “We really scoured all the agencies earlier this year for any savings and reductions that were tenable, so it just means we have to go deeper.”
Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, said the forecast is a “huge concern” and means the new budget passed earlier this year is already underwater. He called for budget writers and the governor to come into the next legislative session with ideas for further spending cuts to make ends meet.
“Increasing taxes has not resolved the deficit problem, so maybe it’s time we look at the other side of the equation,” Orcutt said.
Gov. Bob Ferguson called the new projections “disappointing but not surprising.”
“As I write my first budget, I will be focused on delivering a balanced budget that maintains core services to the people of our state,” he said in a statement.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)The University of New Orleans should adopt LSU branding and become LSU New Orleans when it transfers to the LSU system, interim LSU President Matt Lee told the Board of Regents Tuesday. 
Lee said the change is necessary to make the transfer successful. UNO was known as LSU New Orleans from its founding in 1958, when it was considered a branch of the Baton Rouge main campus, until its change to the University of New Orleans in 1974. 
“I think for this to really work, it’s going to have to be LSU New Orleans because you’re marrying two well known brands,” Lee said, referring to LSU and the city of New Orleans. 
UNO was previously part of the LSU System until it was moved into the University of Louisiana System 14 years ago, with proponents of the move saying it was necessary for the New Orleans school to get out of the shadow of the much larger Baton Rouge campus.
State lawmakers earlier this year approved transferring the university back to the LSU System in response to UNO’s long-running enrollment decline, which has caused a fiscal crisis for the school. UNO is the only public research university in New Orleans and is considered vital for the region. 
A committee to oversee the transition will hold its first meeting early next month, LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said. 
UNO’s enrollment decline spans two decades. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. 
For several years before President Kathy Johnson took over the university in 2023, university administrators did not align spending with falling enrollment. The school faced a $30 million budget shortfall last fiscal year and implemented layoffs, staff furloughs and a spending freeze in an attempt to make ends meet. 
Lawmakers and university leaders hope the transfer will have a positive impact on student numbers. Despite the national trend of falling enrollment, every school in the LSU System has reported increasing, often record-breaking enrollment over the past several years.

Members of the New Mexico Congressional delegation are calling on the USDA Secretary to exempt New Mexico's federal forests from a rescission of the ""roadless rule,"" saying opening up swaths of wild forests to timber or other uses exposes the state to wildfires and has other costs. (Courtesy Gila National Forest)All five members of New Mexico’s all-Democratic Congressional delegation have signed on to a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that requests the state be excluded from the Trump administration’s proposed repeal of the so-called Roadless Rule.
The 24-year-old Roadless Area Conservation Rule was implemented to restrict road construction and timber harvesting on over 58 million acres of federal Forest Service land across 38 states. This includes about 1.6 million acres of land in New Mexico, which impacts all five of the state’s national forests. However, the Gila National Forest has the most protected acreage.
Rollins announced the proposal to rescind the rule in June during the Western Governors’ Association meeting held in Santa Fe, and contends the rule change will give state and local experts the freedom to make decisions about forest management and allow the logging industry to grow.
New Mexico’s Congressional delegation sent a letter to Rollins on Sept. 19, after three weeks of public comment ended. The delegation asked the secretary to exclude New Mexico from the rollback, citing negative impacts to the state’s vulnerability to wildfires, public safety and the outdoor recreation economy.
“New Mexico is particularly vulnerable to wildfire,” the letter reads,” with a risk profile higher than 82% of the United States. Multiple studies, including those conducted by the federal government, have confirmed that wildfires are much less likely to ignite in roadless areas.”
According to the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, about 1,000 wildfires have been reported in 2025 as of September, impacting more than 197,000 acres of land. Communities across the state are still recovering from wildfires in recent years, which exacerbate flooding conditions and landslides, disproportionately affecting rural and lower income residents, the letter states.
The delegation also pointed to the disruption of wildlife movement and habitat conservation by road construction, as well as outdoor recreation, which they said generates “$3.2 billion in New Mexico and supports nearly 30,000 jobs.” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) recently urged New Mexicans to provide public input on the proposed rule change.
“This is being imposed…by people in the White House, who frankly have never harvested a bull elk or [caught and] released a native trout,” he said on the U.S. Senate floor. “The truth is that the roadless rule protects us from wildfires, it ensures clean drinking water for communities, and it sustains wildlife habitat for wildlife and for sportsmen.” 
Last week’s letter noted that road construction in backcountry areas is linked to an increase in dust and runoff and will negatively impact watersheds that provide water to multiple cities in New Mexico and could pose a threat to native aquatic species. The delegation also pointed out that the Roadless Rule already allows for timber harvesting for purposes of “ecological or wildfire mitigation purposes.” 
According to the national environmental law nonprofit organization Earthjustice, more than half of the responses received by the USDA opposed the proposed rule change. The organization noted in a statement that other members of Congress have also asked for more time for the public to provide comments.
“Many of the submitted comments centered on how irresponsible this rollback would be considering the trend of hotter and more severe wildfires that have plagued national forests in recent years,” the organization stated.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/52538309861_f11dae585d_o.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina lawmakers have passed a wide-ranging crime bill, making changes to pre-trial release requirements and paving a new path to resume the death penalty in a Republican-led package that sparked fierce partisan disagreements.
The House approved the bill Tuesday, sending it to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk less than 48 hours after it was made public. Titled “Iryna’s Law,” it comes weeks after Ukrainian Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed on Charlotte light rail.
GOP leaders, who hold majorities in both chambers, tout the legislation as a key step in cracking down on violent crime and repeat offenders, while laying the groundwork to resume the state’s death penalty.
“Iryna Zarutska’s murder is a tragic reminder of what’s at stake,” Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) said. “That’s why we are delivering some of the strongest tough-on-crime reforms in North Carolina history.”
Democrats argue the bill would not have prevented Zarutska’s death. They have decried a lack of investment into mental health treatment and public defenders. And late changes to the bill’s death penalty language prompted several Democratic senators to walk out ahead of a vote Monday night.
“We have to address the root issues,” said Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg). “And that takes hard work, deliberation and thoughtfulness. We must stop puffing our chests out … and using inflammatory language, and be serious.”
The bill limits pre-trial release options for defendants accused of “violent offenses,” and funnels repeat offenders toward involuntary commitment at mental hospitals.
It also ramps up judicial scrutiny of court magistrates, while streamlining the death penalty process and pursuing new methods of execution.
House Bill 307 passed the House on Tuesday, 82-30, after hours of tense and emotional debate. The Senate vote Monday was 28-8, with a majority of Democrats walking out of the vote.
Stein has not yet said whether he will sign or veto the bill. He has said he supports several key provisions, but has not weighed in on changes it makes to the death penalty.
Leaders agree on importance of mental health, but remain far apart on solutions
Mental health services and treatment remain critical to the state’s criminal justice system, Republicans acknowledge.
Sen. Danny Britt (R-Hoke) said there was “more work to do” on the matter. And Iryna’s Law would send more repeat offenders directly to hospitals for mental health evaluations. The man charged with murdering Zarutska, Decarlos Brown, Jr., reportedly had untreated schizophrenia.
But GOP leaders were reluctant to allocate money on mental health in the bill, shooting down amendments to spend millions on training magistrates and law enforcement.
“It’s not my understanding that the reason he was failed is because there wasn’t resources to get him an evaluation,” Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters Monday night. “He was failed because his mother wanted somebody to pick him up, and there was not the willingness on the part of the system to do that.”
Brown was previously admitted to a mental hospital for two weeks, The Charlotte Observer reported in an interview with his mother, and received medication. But they did not take him in long-term, and he stopped taking the medication.
Asked how the legislature could legislate the “willingness” he referenced, Berger responded: “You hope that you have people in positions that are making those kinds of decisions, that understand the consequences of failure to act. And if you don’t … then we need to get other people in there.”
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) fumed after the vote Monday night that Republicans were unwilling to spend more money. The bill failed to address “our broken mental health system” and “underfunded and overtaxed law enforcement,” Batch said. A representative of the state’s ACLU chapter has called the bill’s approach to involuntary commitment “a road to nowhere.”

“We just don’t want to pay for it,” said Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) during House debate on Tuesday. “We want to punish our way out of it.”
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) said Monday she had dealt with the involuntary commitment process first-hand, with her teenage son.
“This ain’t going to solve it,” Cunningham said. “This ain’t going to fix it.”
Could NC begin using electric chair or firing squad?
In its original form, Iryna’s Law made some procedural changes to North Carolina’s death penalty process. Defendants’ appeals would be governed by stricter rules, and cases involving capital punishment would proceed in their own counties, rather than just Wake County.
But an amendment tacked on mid-debate on the Senate floor by Republicans expanded those changes.
Now, the bill would require the state to adopt another method of execution if lethal injection — currently the state’s default method — is found to be unconstitutional.
Executions have been on pause in North Carolina for almost 20 years, tied up by legal and regulatory challenges. The bill’s new language means that when the courts do eventually rule on the practice, the Department of Adult Corrections would adopt another method used by another state. That could include the electric chair or a firing squad.
There are 122 offenders on North Carolina’s death row with a case dating back to 1985.
Berger told reporters he believed there were opponents to the death penalty that were seeking “so many roadblocks that it’s never going to be implemented.”
“Other states have been able to untie those kinds of situations,” he said. “And it’s our belief that these measures should help us move forward in those cases where folks have exhausted all their appeals, and judgment has been rendered.”

Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry) defended the capital punishment process during debate Tuesday, saying those on death row “are getting a fair trial because they have experts in the death penalty” — referring to capital defenders.
Berger’s changes came as a surprise to Democrats. Several had planned to support the bill, but said they couldn’t vote for it as amended.
“The General Assembly should not be using the death of this young lady to sanction state-sponsored murder of individuals who are on death row,” said Sen. Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg), who has met with Zarutska’s family.
When the bill came up for a final vote on Monday night, a group of Senate Democrats walked out of the chamber.
“Until they decide to stop being petulant children, we don’t have to continue to participate in their nonsense,” said Batch, the Democratic leader.

The changes saw similar blowback across the building, where House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) called the final product “cynical” and “mean.”
“The battle may be done, the war isn’t,” Reives said. “But I really, really wish we had done this different.”
Violent crime rates have decreased
Available data shows that violent crime rates have decreased, both in North Carolina and nationally, over recent years.
The rate of violent incidents in North Carolina dropped 1% from 2019 to 2024, according to the Council of State Governments Justice Center’s analysis of FBI data.
That’s one of 39 states in which violent crime decreased during that period; 11 other states saw violent crime increase.

According to the lawsuit, the abuse began in December 2022 when Joseph and other fraternity pledges for the Nu Eta chapter met in the library to have a “haze talk.” Members told pledges they would take their money and food and deprive them of sleep, and that the members would use intimidation and threaten pledges with physical abuse and beatings with a 2×4 plank of wood cut into the shape of a paddle, the lawsuit says. 
The culmination of the hazing occurred in April 2023 during the fraternity’s “Hell Night,” a ritual where members beat Joseph and pledges severely with a wooden paddle, the lawsuit alleges. Joseph was sent to the emergency room, spent nearly 11 days in the hospital and had to relearn how to walk, the suit says. 
University officials were made aware of the abuse and did nothing to help Joseph or discipline his abusers, according to the lawsuit. 
The University of Southern Mississippi and Omega Psi Phi did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment by press time Tuesday. 
“We see violent incidents like these time and again across the nation but, instead of taking action, fraternity leaders and university officials alike sweep it under the rug and write it off as ‘boys will be boys,’” Bakari Sellers, a civil rights attorney at Strom Law Firm, who is representing Joseph, said in a press statement. “This isn’t youthful indiscretion. This isn’t tradition and it sure isn’t brotherhood. It’s criminal violence and abuse and it needs to end.” 
The lawsuit also alleges that in fall 2022, a student who pledged Nu Eta, months prior to Joseph also suffered hazing injuries, including a torn ligament in his knee. It required the student to use crutches to participate in the fraternity’s probate ceremony. USM did not investigate hazing-related injuries suffered by this student or take action against the fraternity, according to the lawsuit. 
“If someone struck a stranger with a 2×4, they’d face criminal charges,” Shequeena McKenzie, an attorney in Jackson who is also representing Joseph, said in a press statement. “USM’s response suggests that the same conduct inside a fraternity is somehow acceptable.”
Joseph is seeking compensation to cover medical bills, loss of income and attorney fees. He is also seeking a court order to stop defendants from continuing alleged behavior while leaving room for other remedies to be granted during a jury trial. 
It is another instance in a high-profile hazing case against Omega Psi Phi. Earlier this year, Caleb Wilson, a Southern University student in Louisiana, died in an off-campus hazing incident involving the Beta Sigma chapter of the fraternity. Three members of the organization were later expelled from the fraternity and charged with crimes related to Wilson’s death.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23165331/AP17110673074171.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Snap Inc., the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, accusing the app’s creators of harming teenagers.
He said the company designed the social media platform “with manipulative features that prey on the mental health of our children.” He said Snapchat has been marketed as safe for teens.
“We allege it is not,” Kobach said.
He added: “They have prioritized profit over safety, and our lawsuit holds them accountable for the devastating harm caused to Kansas families.”
The 40-page lawsuit, filed in Washington County on Kansas’ northern border, contains redactions and compiles information from internal Snap reports, news interviews and content from the app to build its case.
It alleges Snap violated the Kansas Consumer Protection Act. Those violations are based on the app’s age rating in app stores, around 12 years old and up, and app store disclaimers citing infrequent or mild profanity, mature and suggestive themes, sexual content, nudity and substance use or references.
“In reality, content in all of those categories appears frequently and is intense on Snapchat,” the lawsuit reads.
The lawsuit references the death of a teenage boy from Shawnee, who died in 2021of fentanyl poisoning after reportedly purchasing from a drug dealer on Snapchat.
“Numerous young people, including young people in Washington County, Kansas, have been exposed to drug dealers on Snapchat offering illicit or regulated drugs for sale,” the lawsuit said. “Such content on Snapchat includes posts featuring lists of drugs and prices.”
That was the only mention of Washington County residents, of whom there are around 5,500, in the lawsuit. 
A Snap spokesperson said in a statement that the safety of users is a top priority. The company didn’t directly address the lawsuit but said it has incorporated privacy and safety features into the app since its inception.
“Unfortunately, the reality is this — there is no single safety feature or policy that can eliminate every potential threat online or in the world around us,” the statement said. “This is why we continually adapt our strategies to fight against bad actors, who change their tactics to exploit online platforms for their nefarious ends, and this will remain a crucial part of our efforts to help keep Snapchatters safe.”
For the past three years, the company has commissioned research into the experiences of Gen Z teens and young adults from six countries, including the United States, on online platforms.
The 2024 surveys asked more than 9,000 people — around 3,000 teens, 3,000 young adults ages 18-24 and 3,000 parents of teenage children — about online risks, digital wellbeing, defense against online threats and sextortion.
The survey found that online risk was at a three-year high for Gen Z users in 2024. Misinformation, hate speech and bullying, sexual risks, threats of violence, impersonation, extremist content and self-harm were all perceived as more prevalent than in previous years.
Of the Gen Z teens and young adults surveyed, 80% reported experiencing some online risk, a two percentage point increase from 2023. Forty-seven percent of Gen Z respondents said they had some interaction with intimate or sexual imagery.
Of those, 39% received such imagery, 35% were asked for imagery of themselves and 17% shared or distributed content depicting someone else.
Joseph Sciarrotta, the attorney general’s chief deputy who was hired last month, said the office investigated Snap, finding its features “are intentionally designed to exploit the vulnerabilities of young minds.”
“From Snapstreaks that create immense social pressure to an infinite scroll that eliminates natural stopping points, the platform is a digital trap for children,” Sciarrotta said. “This action alleges that the company made deceptive and misleading claims about safety and parental controls that have contributed to an unacceptable mental health crisis among our youth.”
The lawsuit asks for a judge to find Snap in violation of state law, prohibit the company from continuing the violations and force Snap to pay fines, fees and court costs. The attorney general’s office enlisted Washington, D.C.-based firm Cooper and Kirk to help argue its case.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kobach-9-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-23 17:57:59.866609

Research reveals that animals that summer on ranchland and in residential subdivisions near town pile up on the National Elk Refuge's southern end — a trait that will help wildlife managers steer hunters toward the problematic cohort.   
The post ‘Judas elk’ to help target Jackson Hole ‘suburban elk,’ easing pressure on Yellowstone migrants appeared first[...]","In the coming months, thousands of elk will migrate onto the National Elk Refuge, just outside the town of Jackson, where the Jackson Elk Herd winters. 
Historically, they’ve traveled long distances from summer range in places like southern Yellowstone National Park, but so-called “suburban elk” that stick nearer to Jackson to feed off hayfields and in residential subdivisions are increasing. It’s a headache for ranchers and wildlife managers that also reduces hunting opportunities and threatens the herd’s natural biodiversity. To best conserve long-range migration, wildlife managers would ideally concentrate hunting pressure on the refuge on the “suburban elk” — a task that has been nearly impossible until now.
“When they’re on the refuge and there’s thousands of elk milling around, you can’t tell just by looking at them whether they migrated eight kilometers or 80 kilometers,” said Gavin Cotterill, a quantitative disease ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. 
New research Cotterill headed changes the equation. 
“Based on this work,” he said, “we can predict where conflict-prone suburban elk [that get into livestock feed] are going to be.” 
Cotterill’s study, “Elk personality and anthropogenic food subsidy: Managing conflict and migration loss,” assists wildlife managers with tools to decipher which of the 10,000 elk in the herd are migrating from where. Specifically, the research could help concentrate hunting pressure on the lowland elk that summer on ranchland and amid the trophy homes of the wealthiest Americans once they reach the National Elk Refuge. Doing so could help efforts to preserve struggling migratory elk that now take the brunt of the gunfire. 

Migrating animals in the Jackson Elk Herd travel an average one-way distance of 39 miles, with journeys topping out at 168 miles. The routes are delineated in this map from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Ungulate Migrations of the Western United States, Volume 1. (USGS)
How does it work? With location data from 101 GPS-collared female elk, Cotterill used modeling to discover that the conflict-prone elk that generally live south of Grand Teton National Park were four times more likely to use the southernmost feeding areas on the refuge nearer to the town of Jackson. 
“The single strongest predictor of which feeding area they’re going to use was whether they ate livestock feed in suburban areas,” Cotterill said. 
That’s a finding the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has a keen interest in, and it has potential to help reverse an undesirable trend that’s long been afoot in the Jackson Elk Herd. Historically, virtually all animals that winter on the National Elk Refuge were considered “long-distance migrants” that spent summer in places like Yellowstone National Park, the Teton Wilderness, the Gros Ventre drainage and northern Grand Teton National Park. By 2012, however, the proportion was less than 60% — and the suburban elk are potentially still in the process of taking over.
“We may actually be seeing a slight increase in those short-distance migrants,” Game and Fish Disease Biologist Ben Wise said.

The growing imbalance, he said, is related to big differences in reproductive success and calf survival. Lowland elk that live in housing subdivisions and on ranches are adding 40 or 50 calves to their ranks for every 100 cows, but the calf ratio is only about 20 per 100 for migrating elk. 
Wise, who’s a co-author of the study, explained that come fall of 2026, the bolder elk that dwell in the refuge’s southernmost feeding areas will have more of a target on their back. And it’ll be because of their own kind. He’s using the term “Judas elk” to describe GPS-collared animals that will assist Game and Fish in pointing hunters toward the problematic suburban elk. The tracked animals, in essence, will be attracting a source of danger — human hunters — to their herdmates. 
“It’s something that’s really kind of novel for this area,” Wise said. “We have so many different elk coming from so many different summer ranges into this winter range [on the refuge]. And we’re definitely trying to manage for certain segments and bolster those populations where we can, while still getting harvest on the segments that we don’t have a lot of access to anywhere else.” 
Easing hunting pressure on the long-distance migratory elk has historically proven a great challenge because the herds cut through other late-season hunt areas, like Grand Teton National Park. Then they’re the first to arrive at the federal wildlife refuge, where hunters are waiting for them.   
Jackson Hole’s pesky suburban elk, meanwhile, spend most of the fall in a much trickier landscape where they’re hard to hunt. Then they’re typically the last cohort to show up on the refuge.

The “Judas elk” will help wildlife managers point hunters toward the so-called suburban elk when they do arrive. 
“When they cross the line, how do we get hunters to go out there?” Wise said. 
The elk will be tracked this winter as part of a broader effort to equip 150 members of the Jackson Elk Herd with GPS collars. They’ll be programmed to transmit “finite, fine-scale information” about their location several times a day from November through early January, Wise said.  
In wildlife management, the concept of a “Judas” animal — a nod to the Christian Bible’s apostle who betrayed Jesus— is well established. “Judas wolves” were used during the mid-1990s to capture packmates of Canadian wolves reintroduced into the Northern Rockies, and “Judas lake trout” have also been used to map out the nonnative species’ spawning beds in Yellowstone Lake with the intent of choking out the next generation before it begins. 
Using “Judas elk” to help hunters go after Jackson Hole’s conflict-prone suburban elk comes after years of effort to rebalance the herd by conserving the long-distance migrants.
“Elk are pretty, pretty savvy to anything that we’ve done,” Wise said. “How do we outsmart this herd of elk for more than just one year?”
Cotterill’s study also reflected on the complex task of conserving the Jackson Elk Herd’s migrations. Movement corridors in Jackson Hole cut through protected landscapes like the Bridger-Teton National Forest and are “pretty well preserved” as open spaces, he said. 
“What we’re saying is that might not be enough,” Cotterill said. 
Adaptable species like elk readily capitalize on human-related food sources, like hay meant for cattle. They also take “anthropogenic refuge” from predation, and have less risk of being eaten by grizzly bears or wolves in the suburbs than they do in wilder places. 
“That’s working against long-distance migration,” Cotterill said, “in the favor of these short-distance migrants.”
Cotterill’s study was supported by the USGS’ Ecosystems Mission Area. It’s a division of the federal agency that the Trump administration is seeking to almost completely eliminate.

St. Louis County Councilwoman Lisa Clancy, the bill sponsor, dropped the bill during the council’s Tuesday meeting. 
“After engaging with stakeholders and hearing a lot of thoughtful discussion between stakeholders and also the council, I have come to the conclusion that there is not a pathway at this time or a consensus to move forward on this,” Clancy said during the meeting.
Clancy said she’s hopeful state legislators will address the “very serious public health and safety issues” when they reconvene in January. 
State law prohibits marijuana products from being sold outside of dispensaries. 
However, thousands of gas stations and other stores statewide currently sell THC products – such as gummies, beverages and vapes – that get people high the same way that marijuana does. 
The difference, producers say, is that the products are made from hemp. Lab and cannabis experts testified last week before the council that there’s no way to ensure these products aren’t made from black-market marijuana without a track-and-track system like the one that’s required for regulated marijuana. 
While some liquor stores – including Total Wine – have self-imposed age restrictions on purchasing the beverages, there’s no government agency regulating the products – and that includes who can buy them. 
For the past three years, Missouri lawmakers have debated legislation that would put all THC products under the same regulatory framework as marijuana. The proposals were met by fierce opposition, particularly from associations representing convenience stores, hemp companies and veterans.
This past spring, Republican state Sen. Nick Schroer of Defiance offered a proposal that carved out an exception for low-dose THC beverages, which have been sold in Missouri’s bars and liquor stores for seven years. It still required things like high-dose gummies, THCA flower and vapes to only be sold in marijuana dispensaries. 
Schroer’s bill was filibustered by state Sen. Karla May and other St. Louis Democratic senators, who argued that it would create a monopoly for the marijuana industry and harm small businesses.
Hemp naturally has very little THC, the intoxicating component mostly associated with marijuana. But that potency can be increased with some science.
While marijuana, from seed to final product, is governed by a state regulatory regime, intoxicating hemp products have been completely unregulated by any governmental agency since 2018 — when Congress passed a Farm Bill that legalized hemp. 
If enacted, Clancy’s bill would’ve effectively banned those products in Missouri’s largest county. 
Clancy dropped the bill just before another council member was going to offer a substitute draft.
Earlier in the day, the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association urged Clancy and other council members to drop the bill. 
“We appreciate the efforts of local elected officials in St. Louis County to prevent more area kids from buying and using these unregulated products,”  said Andrew Mullins, executive director of MoCannTrade, “but it is becoming clearer that it’s Missouri state government that needs to lead the way on this public safety issue.” 
Mullins asked the council to withdraw the measure and join the association in Jefferson City to lobby for regulations.
“While a patchwork of regulations and bans across Missouri’s 114 counties is certainly better than the current wild west reality,” he said, “it wouldn’t give parents, teachers and law enforcement the peace of mind they need to hold the bad actors selling and making these products accountable.”
Clancy said if the state fails to take action again next year, then the council “may re-evaluate and reconsider.”
“I’m hopeful that the state will pick this up and their session this coming winter,” she said. “I think all of us on the council will be watching it carefully.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)State utility regulators split Tuesday in Pierre over whether a proposed 120-megawatt energy storage facility in northeast South Dakota needs a state permit, ultimately voting 2-1 to deny a developer’s request for an exemption.
Crowned Ridge Energy Storage petitioned the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission in August for a declaratory ruling that the project does not meet the legal definition of a facility subject to state permitting. The project is designed to store excess electricity from the electrical grid and from Crowned Ridge Wind’s turbines in the Watertown area. It would store enough electricity to power tens of thousands of homes. 
Crowned Ridge is an affiliate of Florida-headquartered NextEra Energy Resources.
Commissioner Chris Nelson moved to grant the company’s petition. He said regulating large-scale batteries would exceed the commission’s legal authority. 
“Batteries don’t generate electricity,” Nelson said. “Secondly, if the Legislature had intended for these to be cited, they need to flat out say so, and not make us try to be electrochemical analysts to figure out whether it should or shouldn’t be.” 
The energy storage facility, planned for commercial operation in December 2027, would be among the first large-scale energy storage projects in the state. Documents in the commission docket say the project would consist of rows of large lithium-ion batteries housed in white, semi-trailer-sized containers on about 15 acres.

Mike Nadolski, a lawyer for the company, said the battery system does not generate new electricity and therefore falls outside the commission’s authority. He said the project simply stores and later injects that energy back into the power grid.
The state’s three elected commissioners are assisted by staff. Staff attorney Amanda Reiss said their review centered on whether discharging stored power back into the grid could legally be considered “generation.” Staff wrote in their review that the project could qualify as an energy conversion facility, which would require a permit. Staff left the question to commissioners after noting the laws were open to interpretation.
Commissioner Kristie Fiegen offered a substitute motion to deny the company’s petition and make it seek a permit.
“Yes, energy is stored chemically, but when it comes out, electricity is generated,” Fiegen said. “I’d rather err on the side of customer protection.”
Chairman Gary Hanson joined Fiegen, calling the matter “the beginning of a new era in electricity in South Dakota.” He said large-scale energy storage could reshape the grid and deserves regulation.
The 2-1 vote means Crowned Ridge must pursue a state permit; however, commissioners said the Legislature could still clarify how battery storage projects should be treated under South Dakota law. The Legislature will begin its annual lawmaking session in January.

(Photo by Brian Bahr/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma State University owes its long-time football coach as much as $15 million after cutting ties with him, according to his renegotiated contract.
OSU Athletic Director Chad Weiberg said when he met with Mike Gundy on Tuesday to end his employment, the two did not discuss lowering the $15 million buyout that Gundy is guaranteed if he’s terminated without just cause. 
The funds for the buyout will come from the general revenue or operating budget, and OSU plans to honor its contractual obligations to Gundy, he said. 
Gundy is departing the state’s largest university system in the middle of his 21st season and amid a poor record in recent years. OSU has lost 11 of its last 12 games, including most recently to the University of Tulsa. This marks the first OSU loss to the team since 1998. 
Weiberg said in a statement that the football program experienced “unprecedented” success under Gundy’s leadership, but the college football landscape has “drastically” changed in recent years. 
“This was not something that I thought we would be doing today on this Tuesday,” Weiberg said at a press conference. “I fully expected to beat the University of Tulsa. I expected the results of this season to be different than they’ve been so far. … We have higher expectations than that. So when it just appeared that that was not going to be met, it felt like for the good of the program.” 
Gundy was being paid over $6.8 million, a $1 million cut from previous years after his contract was renegotiated in December, according to reporting from The Oklahoman. 
He signed a restructured contract in December that makes him eligible for the $15 million buyout should he be terminated in the first three years, according to a copy of his contract obtained by Oklahoma Voice. The new contract was negotiated amid a 3-9 losing season and inflammatory remarks from the coach calling some OSU fans “failures.” 
Gundy’s renegotiated contract obligates OSU to pay him in monthly installments for “liquidated damages,” according to his contract. If he were fired in 2028, the number would have dropped to $10 million. 
Just causes, as defined in the contract, include insubordination, violation of athletic rules, criminal convictions, conduct affecting the athletic department, improper personal conduct and dishonesty, among other things. 
Weiberg said he and OSU President Jim Hess are in “lock step” with this decision. 
“This is a decision about what’s best for our football program, our student-athletes and Oklahoma State University and it reflects our unwavering commitment to championship-level football and competing for national success,” Hess said in a statement. 
OSU’s offensive coordinator Doug Meacham was named interim head coach while OSU conducts a search for a permanent replacement.

WEST RUTLAND — After stepping into his new role of executive director at West Rutland’s Carving Studio & Sculpture Center, Noel Sinozich is shaping the start of the organization next chapter with the unveiling of two new pavilions.
Following the retirement of longtime studio director Carol Driscoll, Sinozich stepped into the role earlier this summer and is taking on the responsibility of honoring the foundation Driscoll laid for the future.
With a long-time background in finance, working for companies such as Boston Globe Media and its umbrella companies as a business and financial analyst, Sinozich brings strong organizational management skills to the studio.
Sinozich’s arrival brings the organization more than just a new executive director, as the studio also welcomes new Board of Trustees President Jeff Yates and Vice President Marianne Klimchuk.
“We have a new director, we have a new president and vice president of the board. It’s a really fun reset moment. It’s really exciting that you come into this place that has all this history, and even now you’ll see alumni who have been coming here for 20 years,” Sinozich said.
One of Sinozich’s and the board’s goals for their new initiatives at the studio is to strengthen community outreach and connect with the surrounding neighborhoods more.
Two projects that already achieve this are the Downtown Rutland Sculpture Trail, featuring multiple artists creating marble monuments for notable Rutland figures; and the Stone Bench Project, bringing together local teens to work with limestone to create benches for neighboring towns.
“The board brought me on to grow the offerings of the studio. They want to do more for the local community of Rutland and West Rutland, neighboring Castleton, all the other towns as well. Do more stone programs, do more metal programs, bring in new mediums, get new equipment — you know, just be able for the studio to really kind of put itself in a place where it is at the forefront of, if you want to learn a really high barrier to entry form of sculpture, this is where you come,” Sinozich said.

Sinozich explained he sees these programs as just the beginning of wider efforts to engage the local community and make the studio a resource for people across Rutland County.
“I think our biggest thing is we want to make sure that people in this community, in West Rutland, know that this is a resource for them, too,” Yates said. “If we can reach out to the community, that’s what I would want to do. I feel like they’re right down there. I want to bring them up here. When I say to people, ‘Oh, I’m the president of a carving studio,’ and they go, ‘There’s a carving studio?’ And I go, ‘Yes! You should look it up, you should come here.’”
Yates and Sinozich are not the only two passionate about being a larger resource for the surrounding community.
“We feel like we’re an underutilized asset for the community, said longtime Board Member Carolyn Enz Hack. “We hope to see more people who live in the area come and visit us, come to our parties, come to walk in the sculpture garden.”
Other plans now in place since Sinozich has taken control of the studio include more winter programs and preparing the studio for working during the colder months.
“The key thing for me right now is to provide more programming year-round. Right now, a lot of the programming is really clustered from June to September. We have some programming before that in May, and after that in October, but I’ve been working on making sure that the insulation and heating systems are in place, and all that, so we can do some stuff in the winter,” Sinozich said.
Sinozich also discussed doing more partnerships with universities’ sculpture programs, both locally and nationally, to focus on stone. Stone is often hard for universities to let their students work on due to its weight, and many programs don’t have access to it. Sinozich said he is already in talks with professors to reach this goal.
In a symbolic passing of the torch, the studio unveiled two new 800-square-foot timber-framed pavilions last Friday. Originally planned and mostly constructed under Driscoll’s direction, Sinozich saw the pavilions to completion.
“We used to always be underneath these little plastic tents. They leak, they really don’t keep you cool in the summer. As the sun came in, you tried to hide somewhere in the shade. Everybody tries to get to one side because the sun slants in one way,” Yates said.
In addition to shielding artists from outdoor conditions, the new pavilions are also equipped fully for convenience.

“Stone carvers use a lot of power, so each of the posts of the pavilions has its own dedicated circuit and air, and each of the pavilions has an underground air feed that powers their pneumatic tools, air chisels, and just makes the work so much faster. Being able to get everybody the right amount of air and power in a place that’s right by their workspace, so they’re not tripping on hoses and stuff like that, provides not only just a more pleasant experience, but a safer one,” Sinozich said.
The second pavilion, placed behind the studio, is geared toward the welding and metal workshop. Those outlets allow for more heavy-duty metal wielding and power tool usage. This allows for a seamless environment for students and teachers during programs and classes.
“People come here, and then they really just love the community. I mean, really come back for the community as much as the classes, but that really helps, you know, if you can get more people at a time, because we’ll run courses with whatever number,” Driscoll said.
With new programs and ideas on the horizon, and new leadership with Sinozich, the studio is hoping to continue gathering the community together and serving as a hub for aspiring and longtime artists. Trustee Klimchuk said she is looking forward to Sinozich’s approach and attitude for the future.
“He’s a visionary, he’s got great finance skills. He sees the great potential of this organization that we’ve all seen. He can really take it to the next level. He’s got such a can-do attitude,” Klimchuk said.
Klimchuk’s optimism in Sinozich’s leadership reflects the feeling throughout the entire studio, from staff to board members, that the studio is set on a good path for their future endeavors.
“We’re really excited about what the future brings, and broadly speaking, it’s just the kind of energy that begets energy. It’s an exciting time,” Sinozich said.

June 30, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers filed a lawsuit against Lorex Corp. for what he claims is deceptive marketing that put Nebraska consumers at risk.
Lorex was previously owned by Dahua, a Chinese manufacturer of surveillance equipment that was blacklisted by the U.S. government due to its involvement in surveillance and oppression of ethnic minorities in China, according to a press release from the Attorney General’s Office.
In 2022, the Federal Communications Commission severely limited imports of Dahua products due to “national security concerns.” Before the FCC issued its order, Dahua sold Lorex to Skywatch, a Taiwanese holding company.

Despite the sale, Lorex continues to use Dahua to source the components of its cameras and other surveillance equipment and its networks and systems are still associated with Dahua, Hilgers claimed. He said the companies are separated “in name only.”
“You can sort of change the lipstick on the pig, but it’s still a pig,” Hilgers said.
Lorex products are sold in various Nebraska retailers, including Costco and Home Depot, Hilgers said.
Hilgers alleged Lorex cameras, through its association to Dahua, have serious security flaws that allow hackers, including those affiliated with the Chinese government, to access video and audio feeds and archives. Lorex has continued to assure consumers that its cameras were “safe and secure.” But Hilgers and others have urged caution about their placement in private areas of the home, like a child’s bedroom.

“These are cameras that are being placed in people’s nurseries,” Hilgers said.
Hilgers said he has no evidence that any Nebraskans have been hacked through Lorex products. The lawsuit is more focused on Lorex misrepresenting their products as safe and separate from Dahua, he said.
Hilgers argued Lorex’s ongoing relationship with Dahua was wholly inconsistent with a “commitment” to “integrity, privacy and security.”
It’s a similar angle to other lawsuits the AG’s Office has filed against Chinese-affiliated companies like Temu and TikTok. In both cases, Hilgers argued each company was misrepresenting services provided in a way that posed a risk to Nebraskans’ security.
“We think we’ve been a national leader on fighting back against consumer products that have Chinese Communist Party ties,” Hilgers said.
The lawsuit seeks to prevent Lorex from misleading consumers and raise awareness of privacy risks that Lorex cameras pose, the AG’s Office said in the release. Hilgers said the goal is to push the company to be more honest about product risks.
The lawsuit filed by the Attorney General’s Office seeks civil penalties and fees from Lorex for their violations of Nebraska’s Consumer Protection Act and Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, among other relief.
“Either be honest, or don’t sell,” Hilgers said.

The special election was called after former state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch ally of President Donald Trump, was appointed to serve as U.S. treasurer.
The district, which includes north Fulton and Cherokee counties, reelected Beach with 70% of the vote just last year. That’s why Shigley’s 40% vote tally – which was 10 percentage points better than Beach’s Democratic opponent did less than a year ago – turned heads.

A special Chittenden County program that convenes addiction recovery resources in family court will shutter at the end of the year due to a lack of federal funding. 
Vermont Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Reiber announced the family treatment docket’s end in a Sept. 10 letter.
In 2018, spurred by the state Supreme Court, the Vermont Judicial Commission on Family Treatment Dockets began studying ways for the legal system to address the burgeoning opioid epidemic and its impact on children. At the time, abuse and neglect cases in family court were skyrocketing, up 68% between fiscal years 2013 and 2018, according to the commission’s report.

The commission’s work helped launch the Chittenden County family treatment docket in 2021, the only program of its kind in Vermont currently, though the model is used across the country. Other special treatment dockets exist in Chittenden, Rutland, Washington and Windsor counties, according to the state judiciary’s website, but those programs aren’t operated within family court and tend to involve people who have already pleaded guilty to certain crimes. 
The family treatment docket seeks to steer eligible family court cases toward treatment and services. Parents in the program have often, through legal intervention, lost full custody of their children. In order for a case to be referred to the program, all parties need to agree that the goal would be to reunify the parent with their children if not for substance use standing in the way. 
The docket’s mission is to “improve the safety and well-being of children who have experienced abuse, neglect, or have been placed at risk of harm due to a caregiver with a substance use disorder,” according to Reiber’s letter. Toward that end, the special docket helps lead participants to substance use and mental health treatment, housing assistance and parenting coaching. 
The program is funded solely through a three-year grant from the U.S. Department of Justice, according to the letter, a source the court expects will dry up by the end of the year. Vermont received a nearly $900,000 grant to fund the docket, which had annual operating costs around $300,000, according to Teri Corsones, Vermont’s state court administrator, who added that one court position hired specifically for the program would end.
“Under past experience we anticipated that DOJ would have issued a new round of solicitations for federal funding by now, but to date there has not been one,” Reiber wrote. 
“We want to be clear: the decision to suspend the program if there is no funding is not a reflection of the program’s value or effectiveness,” he wrote. “It is a reflection of the financial reality we face.” 
The docket has seen relatively sparse use — there are currently six participants, according to Corsones. As of April, 33 parents had participated in the docket, incorporating a total of 55 children, since its creation, according to a report conducted by the public policy organization Children and Family Futures. 
The report noted that children who reunified with their parents after their parents’ participation in the program spent less time in out-of-home settings than children who were ultimately adopted and not reunified with their parents. As of April, just more than 20% of participants successfully graduated from the docket, and 30% remained active participants, according to the report’s findings, while just under 49% of parents did not complete the program. 
The Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office is “devastated” that the docket is ending, Sarah George, the county’s top prosecutor, wrote in an email. 
William Gardella, a Chittenden County deputy state’s attorney who primarily handles the county’s child-in-need-of-supervision cases, or CHINS, said the family treatment docket empowered the court to do something rare.
“The court is actually trying to solve a problem and repair a relationship,” he said.
Rather than ordering treatment, which might occur in a regular family court case, the family treatment court brings peer advocates into the process from the addiction recovery nonprofit Turning Point Center of Chittenden County and staff from the Howard Center, a social services organization. 
“All the service providers that DCF wants you to work with, they’re bringing them to you,” Gardella said, explaining how the docket cut through road blocks to accessing treatment.
Gardella said the program has been operating at full capacity over the last year or so. Participants, service providers and court officials meet regularly — weekly, every other week or monthly depending on the case, according to Gardella. Peer support is central to the process as well. 
“We’ve heard about hiking groups starting out of this program,” he said, “ongoing connections that people were going to build to look out for people in the community.”

“Today, we are ready to take the next step to make sure the Charleston facility becomes a crucial part of our growth strategy,” Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo’s chief executive, said during an event at the plant off Interstate 26.

Volvo will continue making the all-electric EX90 SUV at the $1.3 billion factory but will shift much of its focus toward building models that more Americans want to drive.
That includes the XC60 sport utility vehicle, which Volvo previously said it will add to the production line by late next year. More than 27,000 of those vehicles have sold in the U.S. so far this year – a 20% jump from 2024 – while just 2,500 EX90s have sold.
Volvo also said it will add a new hybrid model to the Lowcountry production line by the end of this decade. The new hybrid vehicle is reported to be the next-generation XC90 SUV, but Volvo would not confirm that Tuesday.
“We do see that the XC90, the size and type of that vehicle, is an extremely important product for this market,” said Erik Severinson, chief commercial officer. “It’s also the segment where we see the demand for plug-in hybrid or extended-range technology is the biggest. So, for us, it’s a very natural size of product to think about.”
Finding a way to juice production at the Ridgeville site is taking on greater urgency as tariffs make Volvo’s most popular cars — currently built overseas — more expensive for U.S. buyers. The plant opened in September 2018 with the S60 sedan as its only vehicle, but the model never caught on with U.S. buyers and was discontinued in 2024.
“Today, Charleston produces less than 5% of U.S. sales volumes,” said Francesca Gamboni, Volvo’s chief industrial operations officer. The remaining 95% of Volvos sold in the U.S. — including the automaker’s popular SUVs — are built overseas.

“In five years, our aim is to produce more than 50% of the U.S. volume right here in this facility,” Gamboni said.
She added that the automaker will hire more local suppliers and invest in state-of-the-art manufacturing, such as artificial intelligence, to speed up the transformation.
“We are on an aggressive timeline to bring these new cars to Charleston — as quick as possible,” she said.
Volvo’s South Carolina factory can build as many as 150,000 vehicles per year, but it has been operating at only about 20% capacity to date. The automaker said it plans to move closer to full production while also building the Polestar 3 SUV for its sister brand.
“The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the U.S.,” Luis Reende, Volvo’s president of the Americas, said in a written statement. “By adding another model into production here, we’ll take a big step toward realizing the full potential of our local manufacturing investments and workforce, and accelerate progress toward our ambitious commercial targets in the coming years.”

The Lowcountry plant currently employs about 2,000 people and has invested $1.3 billion over the last 10 years.
Volvo must have a workforce of at least 3,910 by the end of 2027 to comply with its contract with the state, which pledged more than $200 million in tax breaks and other incentives to lure the automaker a decade ago. Volvo officials say they’re confident the plant will hit its employment goals.
“Volvo Cars’ decision to further invest in Ridgeville reinforces South Carolina’s position as a national leader in automotive manufacturing,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a written statement.
The automotive industry, led by BMW’s massive Upstate facility, employs more than 75,000 people statewide and accounts for more than $27 billion a year in economic impact, according to the S.C. Commerce Department.
Volvo, which is based in Sweden but majority owned by China’s Geely Holding Group, sold more than 763,000 vehicles globally in 2024. The automaker reported a record $2.9 billion in core operating profit last year on revenues of nearly $43 billion.
Volvo was founded in 1927 and has been sold in the U.S. market for 70 years. The company recently sold its 5 millionth Volvo to a U.S. customer.

The Utah Division of Outdoor Recreation issued a news release on Tuesday announcing a community survey to “help shape the future of outdoor recreation” in the state’s central region, which includes the rural areas of Juab, Millard, Sanpete, Sevier, Piute and Wayne counties. The area is rich with state and national parks, lakes, rivers, and hundreds of miles of motorized and non-motorized trails. 
The survey is part of the state’s first-ever regional recreation planning effort, with state leaders welcoming community input to guide future investments in trails, parks, open space and recreation facilities across the region. 
“From red rock canyons to alpine forests, the region offers a diverse range of outdoor experiences, and this planning process aims to ensure that these opportunities continue to grow and improve in ways that meet community needs,” the division said.

The central region “long-range recreation plan” will help guide infrastructure and restoration investments through the division’s “outdoor recreation initiative,” which aims to leverage city, state, federal and private dollars to create a “lasting legacy of well-preserved public recreation opportunities,” according to the initiative’s mission listed on the state’s website. 
“Our goal is to provide a variety of recreational experiences that strengthen local communities and foster a deep connection between people and the great outdoors,” the initiative’s mission statement says. 
Jason Curry, director of the Utah Division of Outdoor Recreation, said state leaders want to “grow outdoor recreation the right way, by expanding access while caring for the places that make Central Utah special.” 
“If you hike, ride, paddle or simply enjoy time outside,” Curry said, “this quick survey is your chance to tell us what’s working, what’s missing and where to invest so we can deliver trails, parks and safe access that serve families, visitors and communities for years to come.”
The survey will be open through Oct. 20, available in both English and Spanish. It asks respondents about their primary outdoor recreation activities in Central Utah, challenges they’ve experienced and ideas for improvement. 
“Feedback will directly inform the Central Region Recreation Plan, which will set a vision for the region and direct state investment for years to come,” the division said.

The suit in U.S. District Court in Orlando named Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, the Republican National Committee, Republican Party of Florida, and supervisors of elections in Broward, Miami-Dade, Duval, and Orange counties.
Florida Rising Together filed its complaint a year ago claiming that the “matching protocol” — requiring voters to include the last four digits of their drivers’ licenses or Social Security numbers to register to vote — “is compounded by a legacy of historic and deliberate disenfranchisement and interacts with the effects of racial and economic discrimination in access to the ballot that continue to plague Florida.”
Tuesday, Secretary of State Cord Byrd celebrated U.S. District Judge Wendy Berger’s dismissal.

— Cord Byrd (@CordByrd) September 23, 2025

Florida Rising, a voting-rights organization, alleged disenfranchising administrative policies used by the state, saying that since 2018 more than 43,000 people eligible to vote had been denied due to the matching protocol, and communities of color have been disproportionately affected. 
Florida Rising is free to refile an amended complaint by Oct. 6.
Under the 2002 federal Help America Vote Act, voter registration applications are only accepted after the Department of State verifies the applicants’ identities through Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or Social Security Administration databases.
If the numbers don’t match, voters may fix them or cast a provisional ballot. The voter then has until two days after the election to verify identity. 
That protocol is laid out in statute, and defined in more detail by administrative code. Florida Rising was challenging the matching protocol as it was established through administrative policy, calling it error-prone and that it disenfranchises eligible Florida citizens, especially minorities.
Not enough plaintiffs
“At the very least, Florida Rising’s failure to meaningfully allege or argue a factual or legal distinction between the requirements of HAVA, section 97.053, and the Administrative Policy, raises serious standing concerns. Nonetheless, because the Complaint will be dismissed on other grounds, the Court need not address standing at this juncture,” Berger wrote. 
The court said the group hadn’t named all of the state’s elections supervisors as plaintiffs.
“Indeed, the challenged protocol is a state mandate, which obligates all Florida Supervisors of Elections to execute portions of the Matching Protocol. Thus, the sixty-three non-party Supervisors’ rights and interests are at issue in this case. 
“Florida Rising offers no distinction for initiating the instant action against only the four Supervisors that are parties to this action. Therefore, to afford Florida Rising the statewide relief it seeks, the remaining sixty-three Supervisors must be party to the action, which will not deprive this Court of subject-matter jurisdiction,” Berger wrote.

Ned Lamont took a victory lap in New London on Tuesday after a federal judge ordered work to resume on the Revolution Wind project, and he hinted that ongoing talks with the Trump administration could ease the path forward for both wind and fossil fuel projects in the region.
“We have a lot of catching up to do,” Lamont told reporters from a vantage point overlooking the staging area at the State Pier, which was jam-packed with sections of turbines ready to be loaded onto ships and taken out to sea for installation. 
That installation work, which was shut down for nearly a month on the orders of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, is slated to restart as soon as Wednesday, Lamont said.
“When these wind turbines are spinning in less than a year, it’s going to bring down the price of electricity, because it brings down peak pricing during the winter months, which is the most expensive time,” Lamont said. “This is a big deal for business, so it’s good.”
Lamont was joined in New London by his counterpart in Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, along with a throng of union workers and state and local officials to celebrate Monday’s decision by U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, which lifted the stop-work order.
While the Trump administration may still appeal that decision, Lamberth did not stay his order — thus allowing work to resume immediately on the $6 billion project.
In a statement on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said that Lamberth’s ruling “will not be the final say on the matter.”
“President Trump was elected with a resounding mandate to end Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,” Kelly said. 
Rather than gloating on their initial victory, however, both Lamont and McKee offered a conciliatory note to President Donald J. Trump, saying they were engaged in conversations with administration officials about a broader energy strategy for the New England region. 
“We’re working very closely with the Trump administration,” Lamont said. “We’re doing everything it can, not just right here [in New London] but what we can do to add on additional energy across our region. That’s all the above, from my point of view.”
Lamont has repeatedly touted his relationships with two Trump administration figures in particular: Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. He met with both officials during a visit to Washington, D.C., in February during which he expressed an interest in working with the federal government to secure permits for an expansion of natural gas infrastructure and state-of-the-art nuclear reactors.
The governor also noted that a purported deal between officials in New York and the federal government, which would allow the construction of new gas pipelines, was widely seen as necessary to spare another wind project — Empire Wind — from cancellation by the Trump administration.
But in his efforts to negotiate a similar deal to save Revolution Wind, Lamont said his overtures were repeatedly met with silence. “Show me the ransom note,” was how he characterized those talks to reporters last week, before the judge granted an injunction, allowing work to resume.
And while Lamont suggested some progress was made in talks held over the weekend, he confirmed on Tuesday that federal officials have not made any explicit request for Connecticut to approve natural gas pipelines in order to get them to lift their opposition to Revolution Wind.
Lamont’s willingness to strike a deal with the Trump administration involving an expansion of natural gas pipelines also risks alienating environmental advocates, who see gas as a costly and polluting source of power generation.  
“I don’t think more natural gas is an ‘all of the above’ strategy,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound. “We’re full up on natural gas. You know, it’s by far the majority of what’s powering our electricity grid in the region. Here in Connecticut, we use an awful lot of it for home heating, and that creates a conflict. That’s a conflict, particularly with winter reliability, that offshore wind… is ideally designed to meet.”
Still, Rothenberger said he did not see much downside to officials like Lamont retaining “cordial” relationships with the Trump administration.
In addition to the soon-to-be-installed components of the Revolution Wind development that were stacked up on the State Pier Tuesday, equipment for the developers’ next project — the even larger Sunrise Wind, which will send power to New York — were being staged in preparation for offshore construction.

(Photo: Screenshot of committee meeting)A bill to increase the state’s disabled veteran property tax homestead exclusion amount received a favorable hearing Tuesday in the House Finance Committee.
Under House Bill 118, the first $61,000 of appraised value of a disabled veterans residence would be excluded from taxation. Currently, the first $45,000 is excluded. Surviving spouses may continue to use the benefit under HB 118 unless they remarry.
The committee endorsed a preferred committee substitute with a provision to reimburse local governments 50% of tax dollars lost due to the higher homestead exclusion amount. The bill was referred to the House Rules Committee.
Earlier this year, county and municipal leaders had expressed concern that further lowering tax bills for disabled veterans would make it difficult to provide services county wide.
Brent Lucas, a staffer in the NC General Assembly’s Fiscal Research Division, said Cumberland County and Onslow County, which are home to two large military installations, Ft. Bragg and Camp Lejeune respectively, would feel the impact of the tax breaks the most. Wake, Guilford, Mecklenberg and Harnett counties would also be impacted, Lucas said.
State Rep. Deb Butler, D-New Hanover, said the number of disabled veterans in North Carolina has grown from 45,000 to 75,000 the past five years.
“I’m supportive of the bill but I do think that we need to be careful, particularly right now when we have some unmet needs in this state,” Butler said. “Obviously we want to support our veterans but I do have that cautionary observation for us.”
State Rep. Grant Campbell,  R-Kannapolis, one of the bill’s sponsors, said even with the higher exemption, North Carolina remains “significantly behind” neighboring states in tax relief for disabled veterans.
“We’re still on the lower end of that but I take your point,” Campbell said in response to Butler’s remarks.
An eligible veterans must satisfy at least one of the following requirements:

Have a service-connected total and permanent disability that has been certified by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or another federal agency agency.
Has previously received benefits under the section of the United States Code that authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to assist disabled veterans with acquiring special fixtures or movable facilities to accommodate their disability, which could include land for housing.
The veteran has died and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or another federal agency has certified that, as of Jan.1 preceding the taxable year for which the exclusion is claimed, the veteran’s death was the result of a service-connected condition.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-1024x569.jpeg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In America, diapers have long been treated as a luxury good rather than a necessity.
Half of families with young kids struggle to afford all the diapers they need. A quarter of families miss work as a result, often because they don’t have enough diapers to send with their children to child care.
It’s a largely invisible issue with enormous consequences for the health of parents and children. Studies have found that diaper need is a greater contributor to postpartum depression than food insecurity and housing instability. And when parents don’t have enough diapers, they make do with sanitary pads, rags or other materials. Some report having to leave their children in soiled diapers for extended periods, raising the risk for urinary tract infections and diaper rash.
So Amy Kadens, who has worked in the diaper space for nearly 15 years, wondered: What if diapers were free for the parents who need them most? For decades, the United States has not had a good answer. So she came up with her own.
Diaper banks started popping up across the nation in 2011, collecting donations and dispersing diapers to families through a complex network of local partnerships. They are one of the few lifelines for parents.
Kadens, who co-founded a nonprofit that provides diapers called Share our Spare in 2011, knew that diaper banks often operate with limited staff and resources, and operationally can only address a small percentage of a massive need. Without more government support, they can only get at a slice of the problem.
Federal assistance programs that help low-income families, such as food stamps and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), have never allowed families to use those funds to purchase diapers.
“Diaper banks are doing heroic work with very little. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” Kadens said. But, “I wanted to continue to sink my teeth into this.”
So Kadens started to work on a solution that could give people the funds to get whatever diapers they needed, without the warehouses to store donations or the teams to get those donations out.
That solution was Diaper Dollars, a $40 e-card that users get in their email every month. The virtual card comes with a barcode they can scan at checkout at most major retailers, including Walmart, CVS and Walgreens, that will cover the cost of diapers. So far, users in Illinois and Ohio can access the program.
The idea, Kadens said, was to make it as simple as possible, while also giving parents the ability to choose what brands they preferred.
“Families have brand loyalty,” Kadens said. “I wanted to keep dignity and choice at the forefront of everything we did.”
The Diaper Dollars team went through months of market research to refine the tech to work well for participants. They didn’t want coupons because there was too much fraud in the system, and gift cards meant users could be limited on where to shop.
Instead, they landed on a system that allowed them to build out a catalog of diapers at 6,200 retail locations in the country. The bar code on the digital card recognizes the diapers when it’s scanned and deducts the price from the total purchase. That catalog of diapers is monitored daily and updated in case brands come out with new box sizes or products. It also works for online purchases.
The system does have some limitations. It’s not valid in Amazon or Target, two retailers that don’t yet accept that form of payment. And it also likely only covers a portion of the need: The average family spends about $100 on diapers a month, but families earning a median income can only afford to cover about $65, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It’s also more expensive — parents are paying retail prices plus sales tax (23 states charge sales tax on diapers, including Illinois). By contrast, products at diaper banks are donated or sold to the banks from the manufacturer at deeply discounted rates.
To find participants, Diaper Dollars partners with organizations such as WIC clinics and local hospitals to refer people to the program, which is funded from a mix of philanthropy and financial support from those same partners. Partners establish the eligibility criteria, how long participants can be a part of the program, and whether the stipend will be higher for those with multiple babies.
A pilot program launched in 2023 with 100 people, then in 2024 the Illinois Department of Human Services dedicated $1 million to run its own pilot at a larger scale. Nearly 8,000 people have been served so far, with 10,000 projected by 2026.
Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton told The 19th that she had been looking for solutions that could support people in the postpartum period, when maternal mortality is high, particularly for Black women. Diaper need, specifically, is linked to maternal mental health and considered a potential risk factor for moderate to high maternal depressive symptoms.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2023, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. For White women it was 14.5 deaths.
So when Illinois launched a birth equity initiative to address the needs of postpartum parents, from a home visiting program to better diaper access, it chose to partner with Diaper Dollars.
“Giving someone a card where they can go to the store of their choice, decide what’s best, that is what’s part of dignity,” Stratton said. “Every woman deserves to bring life into this world safely and with dignity.”
Brendan Kitt, Diaper Dollars’ program director, said the program was able to offer an operational solution to a problem the state wanted to address but didn’t have a mechanism for. The system works similarly to a universal basic income, where people in need are given a cash stipend, but it’s more targeted.
“Both for funders and supporters, it’s always a question when you talk to people about where the money goes,” he said. “The fact that we can limit the transactions to the specific needs that we’re trying to serve, I think, is one of the biggest things that legitimized our operation over just giving basic cash assistance.”
Parents who benefited from Diaper Dollars told the organization in testimonials that they’ve had to turn to using underwear or old T-shirts when they didn’t have the money for diapers, often making decisions between paying for rent or diapers.
After going through the program, parents reported that the funds gave them the wiggle room to buy their children other essentials or to make them better meals.
About 90 percent of those who went through the program reported being able to better afford essentials like food, rent and other bills. Some 95 percent felt less stressed about not having enough diapers.
Joanne Samuel Goldblum, the CEO of the National Diaper Bank Network, which has more than 240 partners nationwide, said a model like Diaper Dollars can address unmet needs, particularly in rural areas where it’s harder for diaper banks to distribute products.
“The need is really so big, and it’s not going to be addressed through just one sort of answer or one type of program,” Samuel Goldblum said. “It’s really important to have ways to reach people in all sorts of different communities.”
The Diaper Dollars program has raised about $2 million so far — 45 percent from the state of Illinois, 35 percent from philanthropic donors and 20 percent from grants from community partners. It is now also running in Ohio and expected to expand to Washington soon.
Kadens’ dream is to take the program to every state. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned and some red states instituted abortion bans, conservative lawmakers have been looking for ways to support postpartum parents.
In Tennessee, for example, where abortion was banned in 2022, the state rolled out a new policy in 2024 that allowed families enrolled in Tennessee’s Medicaid program to receive up to 100 free diapers a month for the first two years of life.
Samuel Goldblum said the National Diaper Bank Network has seen more bipartisan support for addressing diaper needs this year “than we’ve ever seen before.”
It should be that simple, Kadens said: “It doesn’t matter if you’re blue or red. Babies need diapers.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diapers-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout). Bobby Cain, a towering figure in Tenneseee’s civil rights movement and one of the first Black students to integrate a public high school in the South died Monday at the age of 85 in Nashville.
One year before the “Little Rock Nine” integrated Arkansas’s Central High School, Cain was the first African-American graduate of Clinton High School in East Tennessee and was among the “Clinton 12”, a group of Black students who were eligible to attend the school on Aug 26, 1956. 
The school’s integration  followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision that declared segregated public schools unconstitutional. Anderson County ended funding to bus Black students across county lines to Knox County, leaving Cain with little choice but to go to Clinton, a small town located about 30 minutes from Knoxville. It became one of the first communities in the South to implement court ordered desegregation.
In an interview with Bill Carey of Tennessee History for Kids in 2017, Cain said he didn’t want to leave all of his friends at Austin High School where he first attended in Knoxville and that his senior year was just something he had to get through.
“It makes me feel good for my grandson to see what his grandfather has done in the past,” Cain said in 2023. “Hopefully people don’t hold onto the negativity and can see that we overcame what we went through during a moment in time.”
Adam Velk, Director of the Green McAdoo Cultural Center, a museum that commemorates the integration of Clinton High School, said that Cain’s contributions are still felt today.
“Every child across our country has access to an equitable public education system because Bobby Cain graduated from Clinton High School on May 17, 1957,” said Velk. “He was given no choice but to be a part of one of the most difficult social experiments in American history. He is a hero not just because he was the first, but because of the circumstances in which he got his education.
The integration efforts of the “Clinton 12” were met with significant resistance. On the first day of classes, white students stood on the steps of the school shouting threats and obscenities as Black students entered the building. Violence also followed. On his third day at Clinton High, Cain and another student were assaulted by a group of young white men after leaving the school’s campus for lunch. Cain later recounted in interviews that the attackers struck them with sticks until police intervened and took the students into custody for their own safety.

Cain and his classmates endured repeated harassment for the remainder of the school year. White mobs staged protests and riots outside of the school and vandalized the building. Tensions were so high that then-Gov. Frank Clement deployed the Tennessee National Guard, the first time a Southern governor used state troops to enforce school desegregation. 
Several members of the Clinton 12 eventually transferred from the area and moved away. Cain remained and was one of only two to graduate from Clinton High School and was attacked in the school cafeteria following the ceremony. It was an assault that left emotional scars over what he felt should have been a day of celebration.
“Despite the numerous threats to his life, the barrage of slurs, and the acts of cruelty Bobby faced on an every day basis, he still managed to persevere,” Velk said.
Cain went toTennessee State University, a historically Black university in Nashville,  graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1961. He then served in the United States Army from 1963-1965. Following his military service, he went on to have a long career with the Tennessee Department of Human Services, retiring as a supervisor in 2002 after 30years. Cain was a lifetime member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and faithful member of Asbury United Methodist Church in Clinton. He was also an active associate member of Fifteenth Avenue Baptist Church in Nashville.
With dozens of awards and accolades to his honor, Cain remained committed and tied to his Clinton experience and its history. He participated in numerous ceremonies honoring the Clinton12, including the 2007 unveiling of the statues outside of the Green McAdoo Cultural Center founded in 2006. The museum is the site of the former Green McAdoo Grammar School, which served as a segregated school for African American students from 1935 to 1965. The “Clinton 12” were also formally recognized by Congress in 2021 through the efforts of  fellow member Jo Ann Allen Boyce, who worked to secure the honor.
“Our heart breaks at the news of Cain’s passing,” said Velk. But we hold Bobby Cain as a hero for the changing world as we know it, and for providing inspiration to communities everywhere along the way.”

Patrick Morrisey addresses reporters Thursday, Feb. 6, 2025, during a news conference about  West Virginia’s participation in the 287(g) immigration enforcement program. (Photo by Amelia Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia State Police, who now have broad immigration enforcement powers through a federal program, arrested 12 individuals for immigration violations over a two day period. The arrests were made during traffic stops. 
This was the first update on immigration-related arrests since Gov. Patrick Morrisey partnered with the United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last month to expand immigration enforcement operations in West Virginia.
“I am proud to have West Virginia’s law enforcement working together with ICE to enforce the nation’s immigration laws and support President [Donald] Trump’s border policies,” Morrisey said Tuesday in a statement. “This partnership is already producing results with a dozen arrests made in just the past few days. I want to commend the WVSP for their work as we continue to support actions that protect West Virginians.”  
Members of the WVSP were operating under the ICE 287(g) program, which gives police officers and National Guard personnel the authority to perform specified immigration enforcement functions.
Participating state police and National Guard members have the authority to make warrantless arrests of any undocumented immigrant entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officer’s presence or view or if the officer believes the person to be arrested is in violation of the law and likely to escape.
Morrisey’s office said that with the assistance of ICE, 12 undocumented immigrants were apprehended by state police between Sunday and Monday during traffic stops that occurred along Interstate 77, near the Pax area of Fayette County. 
“After all 12 were determined to have entered or remained in the United States illegally, the undocumented immigrants were placed under arrest for immigration violations and taken to South Central Regional Jail,” the governor’s office said. 
West Virginia is participating in the “task force model” of the 287(g) program, the broadest of the program’s models that permits law enforcement to enforce immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.
The task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012 during the Obama administration after a 2011 Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination against Latinos in an Arizona task force, Stateline reported. 
Only participating law enforcement personnel who are nominated, trained, certified, and authorized have the authority to conduct the delegated immigration officer functions.

The gathering featured community-driven solutions to one of the most pressing public health challenges facing Black youth.
The plan comes as suicide rates among Black youth and young adults have risen sharply nationwide. In North Carolina, from 2013 to 2022, 377 Black North Carolinians ages 10 to 24 died by suicide, according to state data.
Nearly 17% of Black high school students said they had seriously considered suicide, while more than a third of middle schoolers reported the same. The numbers peak at age 24 — and are especially stark for Black girls questioning their sexual orientation, who now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide.

“This is about empowering communities and tapping into their inherent strengths,” said Kelly Crosbie, director of the state’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services. “I would much prefer that kids get the support they need well before they have a crisis.”
In her speech on Saturday, Crosbie noted youth ages 10 to 18 are now the largest group calling the national 988 crisis hotline, a statistic she described as both “good and shocking.”
The conference drew dozens of participants despite early funding challenges. Dr. Rodney Harris, who coordinated the event, described it as the product of grassroots persistence. “We’re creating a coalition that saves lives,” Harris said in a speech. “This is love in action, because this is the essence of community and family.”
The day included workshops, a documentary screening, and panel discussions led by young advocates. Panelists spoke candidly about the stigma surrounding mental health in Black communities, particularly the pressure on young men to suppress emotions. They urged peers to seek connection rather than isolation.
“Being vulnerable or asking for help does not make you weak. It actually makes you stronger,” said Nautica McCoy, a member of the North Carolina Black Youth Wellness Advisory Board, during a panel discussion. 
Judith Beth VanBoven, who also serves on the state’s youth advisory board, told the audience that sharing their experiences can help others. “Your testimony will become a legacy that someone else will learn from,” she said.
Rafiah Maxi Cole, founder of Sole Survivors of Chicago, also took part in the panel discussion. 
She spoke with NC Newsline ahead of the conference, sharing her own story of loss. In 2020, her 19-year-old son died by suicide. “I wanted to be vocal about learning more about what happened.” 
Maxi Cole has since dedicated her life to prevention efforts, producing the documentary “While the Children Fade” and leading community outreach in nontraditional spaces — from laundromats to bus stops. 
“We must meet the community where the community is,” she said. “Street outreach is the best outreach.” 
She praised North Carolina’s action plan as an important step in reducing the stigma around mental health struggles. “To recognize that Black youth are surpassing any other ethnicity when it comes to suicide ideations and attempts brings about an awareness,” she said in earlier interview. “It’s time to humanize this subject.”
Throughout the day, speakers framed suicide prevention as a collective responsibility. Brandon Johnson, who leads a national Black youth suicide prevention initiative, said in his speech that “this is an act of love, an act of hope, an act of resilience. We care deeply about each and every one of you.”

Community members also shared stories of local resilience. Corey Kent, a barber student at Edgecombe Community College, described how his decision to pursue barbering became a form of service. On Saturday, he was offering free haircuts both as a way to hone his skills and connect with neighbors. “Write your dreams out. Don’t ever stop chasing them,” Kent said. 
Organizers said that the initiative’s success depends on grassroots involvement. Efforts include training barbers and other community members to recognize warning signs of depression, as well as providing culturally responsive care.
Despite political uncertainty surrounding diversity initiatives, organizers said the community-led approach makes their work resilient. “When the community and the village embrace the work, it can’t be stopped,” said Dr. Sonyia Richardson, a UNC Chapel Hill researcher who helped developed the state plan.
The plan will focus on the 17 counties with the highest suicide rates, while maintaining a commitment to reach all 100 counties in North Carolina.
For Crosbie, the stakes could not be higher. “Suicide is now one of the leading causes of death among youth,” she said. “But prevention is possible when we build safe spaces and strong networks of support.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9204176-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan on Monday announced that Kevin Delgado would receive a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to one count of transmitting threats in interstate commerce earlier this year. 
According to court documents, Delgado posted a threatening response in response to a post Nessel made honoring her friend, community leader and activist Samantha Woll, who was murdered. He told Nessel to “watch every step u take,” called her a string of insults which included a homophobic slur, and said she would be “#murdered.”
The case was investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Frances Lee Carlson.
While pleading guilty, Delgado admitted that he threatened Nessel because of her religion and her perceived sexual orientation. Nessel is Jewish and gay. 
“The sentencing of Kevin Delgado sends a strong message that public officials elected to serve the people cannot be hindered by threats and must be able to do their jobs free from intimidation,” Reuben Coleman, acting special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office said in a statement. “The FBI in Michigan will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify, and hold accountable, those who issue dangerous threats against officials dedicated to protecting and serving our communities.”

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier declined to offer his opinion Tuesday on whether the Florida Legislature should put the open carrying of firearms in Florida into state statute.
Following the decision by the state First District Court of Appeals on Sept. 10 that the 1987 law banning open carry in Florida was unconstitutional, the AG declared five days later that in light of that ruling, he was declaring that open carry is now the law of the state.
Speaking during a press conference at the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office on Tuesday, Uthmeier acknowledged that changing the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest situation and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
He went on to caution that federal and state laws still restrict the ability to openly carry a gun in certain locations.
“We’ll see what the Legislature decides to do when they come back,” he said. “I know everybody is taking a look and researching and better understanding the current legal environment right now, so I’m not going to speculate what they do or don’t want to do.”
Uthmeier appeared to be firmer last week that the Legislature would need to pass a law on open carry.
“We’re not going to be enforcing violations of that [open carry] law given this new opinion, but that’s going to have to be addressed — taken out of Florida statute and an open-carry law has got to be put back in place,” he said at a press conference with Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd in Winter Haven last Friday.
Lawmakers are reading and dissecting the judicial ruling, he said, adding that the decision resulted in “some inconsistencies” about concealed-weapons licenses and the permitless carry law passed in Florida in recent years while the open-carry ban was still in place.
Sheriff Judd indicated at that press conference that he believes that the Legislature needs to act.
“When you pluck a piece of that out like the appellate court did without the opportunity to shore up the rest of it, it makes the rest of the law a little wonky,” he said. “I have spoken to the attorney general … the speaker of the House, the president of the Senate, and the chief of staff for the governor, saying, ‘We just need some help so we can redefine and get these lines straight again.’”
No state lawmaker has filed a bill yet that would put open carry into statute. Second Amendment advocates spoke out last week opposing any such bill, fearing such a measure could restrict the open-carry policy the ruling established.
“Member of Florida Gun Rights stand united and strong against any potential infringements on the recent ruling which declared Florida’s ban on open carry as unconstitutional,” said Logan Edge with that group last week.
The new policy is already being observed in Tallahassee in the Capitol.
Scripps Television reporter Forrest Saunders posted a photo on X on Tuesday showing a law enforcement officer with a long gun standing outside a House committee meeting. He reported that the House Sergeant’s office said that it was “a precaution” following the change in law.
Meanwhile, a progressive group in Florida is criticizing Uthmeier for his position.
Voices of Florida, a Sarasota activist organization, is calling on members of the public to sign a petition telling the attorney general that his open carry policy “is reckless, dangerous and a threat to our economy.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-23 20:25:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Report: US DOJ has ongoing concerns about education, housing at youth prison",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/23/manson-youth-institution-juvenile-prison-doj-settlement-report/,"CT's juvenile prison has made progress in some areas but fallen short in key places following a 2024 federal settlement, evaluators found.","Connecticut’s juvenile prison has made progress in complying with a 2024 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, but concerns remain about the residential environment, as well as the education and mental health services incarcerated young people receive in Connecticut, according to a new report. 
The “monitoring report,” released July 15, evaluated the state’s progress toward orders set out in the settlement agreement, which followed a two-year investigation revealing systemic problems with the way mental health and special education services were provided at Manson Youth Institution in Cheshire.
State and federal officials set goals for the facility, including required special education screening for incoming youth, new policies for reviewing and revising special education plans, and maintaining documentation of the services each individual receives. The settlement also required the state Department of Correction to limit the use of isolation as punishment.
Manson has made progress in some areas but fell short in some key places, evaluators found. 
“The monitoring team recommends continued focus on priority areas to achieve substantial compliance and improve the quality of care and services for incarcerated youth at MYI,” the report said. “By addressing these challenges and implementing the recommended improvements, MYI can create a safer, more supportive, and rehabilitative environment for the youth in its care.”
Last week, correctional staff told members of the state’s Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee that they were making changes to improve their compliance with the orders in the settlement. 
“When the juveniles came into our care, they came into a setting [that was] designed to house adult males,” Michael Pierce, warden at Manson Youth Institute, told the committee. “So when the investigation started, their focus was on education, mental health and our isolation procedures. And, rightfully so, we were found to be in non-compliance … we needed some help there.” 
The report, which was conducted by monitor Michael Dempsey and a group of experts between November 2024 and April 2025, found that the facility had made some strides in decreasing the use of force and that staff were “professional and well-trained.” The facility has had 16 incidents where pepper spray was used between January and August of 2025. Most were related to fights or assaults, according to data provided by the agency. 
But assessors highlighted several areas where the department continues to fall short: school days were cut short; young people had too much idle time without meaningful activities; residential rooms were poorly maintained; and mental health assessments and treatment plans lacked detail. 
Connecticut’s acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio told the Connecticut Mirror that while it’s clear the department is starting to implement the changes outlined in the settlement agreement, there’s still “much, much more work to be done.” 
State Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Juvenile Justice Policy Oversight Committee, acknowledged that the department had only just begun to implement some of the changes, and underscored the importance of getting regular updates about the department’s progress. 
“We must not continue blaming the kids for failing. We have to take responsibility for the failure of not providing them with what they need,” Walker said. 
Not a therapeutic environment
The report described the rooms of the facility as having “variable levels of cleanliness” and noted a significant amount of graffiti. The monitor recommended creating a “more homelike environment” using soft furniture, more sunlight and calming colors. 
Pierce, the warden at Manson, told members of the JJPOC on Thursday that the facility was built in the 1970s to house adults. He said the department’s budget this year included $5 million for the remodeling of one of the cottages, and that they planned to buy softer furniture, like a new desk with a stool, nightstands and new mattresses, to make it appear more like a college dormitory. 
The report also found that young people were spending what the investigators believed was too much idle time without meaningful activities. Their review found that young people were spending 3.5 hours after school in their rooms, where they also ate their meals. 
“Youth spend most of their time in small, uncomfortable, drab, living units or rooms, leading to boredom and higher rates of incidents of violence,” the investigators wrote. “The team emphasizes the importance of developing more meaningful activities and programs, particularly on weekends when fewer programs are available to keep youth engaged, reduce idleness, and reduce the need for the excessive amount of operational room confinement hours.” 
Pierce said the young people were out of their cells more than the legally-required five hours per day. He said that while they did have programs aimed at incentivizing good behavior in young people, the investigators “felt it was not as meaningful as it could be.” 
Ashley McCarthy, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department took the concerns seriously and was already working to improve conditions.
“Since November 2024 we have expanded programming to support positive engagement and skill-building,” McCarthy wrote in a statement. She cited fitness programs, chess tournaments and other sports, as well as weekend activities. 
Ghio, the state’s child advocate, said, “ If we want to help the children who are there to rehabilitate, if we want to cut down on incidents, we need to have children engaged in meaningful activities throughout their day and on weekends.”
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy and former Child Advocate, said redesigning Manson into a place for adolescents could be “a little bit trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.”
“The state policy makers have a decision to make,” Eagan said. “Is this the setting, is this environment where we can best meet the needs of youth so that they may make gains and return safely and productively to their communities, or not?”
The report also detailed evidence of young people being disciplined using prolonged periods of isolation.
Lynnia Johnson, deputy warden for operations, told the JJPOC that the department has created a new policy around solitary confinement that requires staff members to check on young people placed in isolation every 15 minutes. While the isolation can last up to 72 hours, Johnson said no one had been placed in isolation for more than 1 hour since the policy began in March. She said that isolation was used only as a last resort.
Eagan said she believes the state should create a dashboard or framework for measuring how well the department was doing at keeping teens safe, the quality of services they were getting and the planning process for young people preparing to return to their communities. 
Not making the grade
The report also pointed to problems with consistency in the young people’s educational experience, noting that between January and March 7, 2025, there hadn’t been three consecutive days in which all the students had a full day of school. (A November 2024 report from the Office of the Child Advocate found that in the 2022-23 school year, students lost nearly 25% of the hours they were supposed to be in school.)
The investigators said that dormitories would arrive 15 to 20 minutes late to school on a regular basis, meaning that students with special education needs wouldn’t always get their full services.
DOC spokesperson McCarthy said that students are taught by certified teachers in classroom setting, and that special education students receive their education from specialized teachers. She said “safety and security concerns” have sometimes impacted their schedule, but “we have taken steps to adjust routines to minimize these interruptions and ensure students receive a full school day.” 
While the report praised the special education department for having certified staff providers on site and for its compliance process, the monitor noted that the teams of people responsible for students’ specialized education plans regularly reduce the amount of time and the services that the young people are supposed to receive — a serious problem that came to light in the original investigation. 
About 61% of students in Manson Youth Institute are identified as having special education needs. 
Addressing the JJPOC meeting, Manson Principal Matt Reinke said the facility was implementing a program called MAP, or Making Action Plans, where special education students identify a team of people and outside resources, like community programs, who can support them. They then create a roadmap for what success would look like after they leave Manson Youth Institute, and what steps they would need to take — like vocational training or college — that would help them reach their goals. Another module, Project Genesis, is also supposed to help young people explore possible careers and get ready to transition back into society. 
Many of the young people at Manson are also behind in reading and math skills. The Office of the Child Advocate has reported that 70% of the teenagers assessed in June 2023 were reading at an elementary school level, and more than half were doing math at an elementary school level. 
Reinke outlined the steps the facility has been taking to address those issues, including increased early data collection about students’ goals and their academic abilities. He said students whose skills are below their grade level receive one-on-one remediation, which he said was successful. 
“ The vast majority of the youth that are at Manson are well below grade level in math and reading, right? And so it’s just unacceptable for them to have anything less than a full day of education,” Ghio said. 
A plan for mental health treatment
Mental health was also a focus of the original investigation, in which the Department of Justice found that the facility did not properly assess the incarcerated young people for mental health needs or identify signs of trauma. The monitor’s report found that the treatment plans they reviewed for the teens “mostly lacked detail and at times failed to target the assessed needs.” 
Dr. Michael Moravecek, the mental health supervisor at Manson Youth Institute, told JJPOC members that the facility has increased its staffing and developed a mental health assessment that is relevant for young people — including questions about education, friends and what they do in their free time. He said they’d introduced more detailed documentation, as the settlement agreement required. 
Moravecek said it was “hard to measure” if the treatment was effective, and said his assessment of progress would be more “qualitative.” 
Rep. Walker said she believes the department must develop ways of measuring the outcomes of any programs or changes that the Department of Correction undertook. 
“I need to see the data, and I need to know — have you made improvements with the services you have been charged to provide with the state?” she said. “We’ve got to be much more transparent.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Manson-Exterior-e1625765290544.jpg,,,2025-09-23 17:57:59.866609

FEMA, which is tasked with compensating wildfire victims, told a court recently it will appeal a judge’s order to pay victims for the emotional toll of the 341,000-acre wildfire. (Patrick Lohmann / SourceNM) Lawyers for the Federal Emergency Management Agency intend to appeal a judge’s ruling that orders the agency to award hundreds of millions of dollars to Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims for the emotional toll of the 2022 wildfire, according to recent court filings.
The notices last week from FEMA and lawyers at the United States Attorney’s Office in New Mexico begin another potentially years-long chapter in a long-running legal dispute. The conflict centers on whether the agency must compensate victims of the state’s biggest-ever wildfire for “noneconomic damages,” which are similar to pain and suffering payments. 
A federal judge has repeatedly ruled against FEMA, including in a 99-page ruling late last year and again Aug. 4. The agency has also faced criticism, including from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, for not accepting the court’s ruling and paying the additional compensation to fire victims, some of whom are elderly or low-income and still grappling with the fire’s impact on their lives.
Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims still wait on FEMA’s decision to appeal judge’s ruling

FEMA and United States Attorney’s Office officials declined to comment on the appeal or the criticism.
After the fire, which resulted from two botched U.S. Forest Service prescribed burns, Congress approved $5.5 billion in compensation for people, businesses and others that suffered losses as a result.   
FEMA interpreted the legislation Congress passed to exclude payments for intangible aspects of the wildfire, saying the law only covered losses with a price tag, like homes, property, vehicles or medical expenses.
But plaintiffs’ lawyers representing more than 1,000 fire victims sued in late 2023 in federal court, saying Congress intended its compensation fund to include payments for “noneconomic damages.” They also argued that New Mexico law allows for such payments, which was one element of the lawsuit, an opinion with which the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office concurs.
In the scar of New Mexico’s largest wildfire, a legal battle is brewing over the cost of suffering

In addition to being legal, plaintiffs’ lawyers say the payments mark one way to ensure the distribution of funds is more equitable, particularly for fire victims who had modest economic losses but were nonetheless affected emotionally in the fire. 
The appeals notices themselves do not lay out the basis for FEMA’s decision to fight federal Judge James O. Browning’s rulings. 
Brian Colón, a former state treasurer and lawyer representing fire victims with law firm Singleton Schreiber, told Source New Mexico in an email late Monday that the Solicitor General of the United States has the final say on how the agency will proceed.
“We hope to hear something soon as to the details of what they intend to appeal,” Colón said.
Colón’s firm has previously estimated the total “noneconomic” damage cost to the compensation fund could be about $400 million. 
While FEMA is fighting the judge’s ruling, it has continued to pay out economic damages to fire victims. According to the latest update Sept. 23, the office had paid out $2.98 billion in 21,515 claims. A little more than $2.3 billion of that has gone to individuals and households, according to the agency.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MORA-SNOW-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave no indication that future interest rate cuts are coming, despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump and Trump-appointed officials for the central bank.
Speaking to more than 500 business, nonprofit and political leaders at The Crowne Plaza in Warwick Tuesday, Powell emphasized the need for a cautious approach to monetary policy in the midst of the unique challenge presented by persistent inflation and a softening labor market.
“There is no risk-free path,” said Powell. “If we ease too aggressively, we could leave the inflation job unfinished and need to reverse course later to fully restore 2%. “If we maintain restrictive policies for too long, the labor market could soften unnecessarily. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate.”
Powell’s comments during the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce’s annual economic outlook luncheon marked his first public speech since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last week. Even after the modest rate cut — the first of the year — other central bank officials indicated they support Trump’s push for faster and more aggressive rate cuts to tackle inflation. Stephen Miran, Trump’s economic adviser and a new appointee to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said Monday that the 4.1% interest rate was still too high. Michelle Bowman, another Trump appointee and vice chair for supervision, also backed speedy and swift rate cuts in separate remarks in North Carolina earlier Tuesday.
Yet Powell, also a Trump appointee in 2018 and then reappointed for a second term under President Joe Biden, made no promises on future rate cuts.
“Our policy is not on a preset course,” Powell said, emphasizing the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to maximize employment while keeping inflation at or near 2%. “We will continue to determine the appropriate stance based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”
Powell’s data-driven mindset over monetary policy has caused tensions with Trump, who since winning a second term has called Powell names and threatened to fire him amid frustrations at the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates steady. 
Powell has remained unflappable in the face of personal attacks. He responded indirectly Tuesday without calling out Trump by name.
“Most of the people who are calling us political, it’s just a cheap shot,” Powell said. “Our argument is doing our jobs. We don’t get into the back and forth with external people.”
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, who introduced Powell to the sold-out crowd Tuesday, was less reserved in his criticism of the federal administration, blasting Trump for his “direct assault” on the central bank’s independence and its members.
“Chair Powell has met these challenges with equanimity and professionalism,” Reed said. “He has somehow managed to stay laser-focused on achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable pricing.”
Indeed, Powell focused much of his opening address and question-and-answer session with Laurie White, president of the Providence chamber, on the mechanics behind the central bank’s decisions. He rattled off a list of economic indicators that inform the Federal Reserve’s approach: inflation and the labor market chief among them, but also financial markets, housing affordability and tariffs.

Explaining the rate cut
The softening of the labor market, evidenced by a rising unemployment rate and depressed job growth, prompted the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates slightly, easing off the “tight” monetary policy it has maintained in the face of inflation through much of the year. 
However, Powell noted that other labor market signals remain stable, including the ratio of job openings to unemployment, while inflation remains elevated. “We took very much a risk management approach,” he said of the most recent rate cuts. “We try to have a policy that can cover the range of plausible outcomes, not just one outcome.”
It’s the attitude that guided Powell, a D.C. native, through a career in finance, first as an investment banker and lawyer in New York before working for the U.S. Department of the Treasury under President George H. W. Bush, and, since 2012, as a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. 
But the economic highs and lows have sharpened in the five years since Powell last visited Rhode Island. Soon after his November 2019 visit, also as part of a Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce event, the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, its grip on the world’s health and economy still lingering today.
“In democracies around the world, public trust in economic and political institutions has been challenged,” Powell said. “Those of us who are in public service at this time need to focus tightly on carrying out our critical missions to the best of our ability in the midst of stormy seas and powerful crosswinds.”
Especially under a federal administration whose trade wars and immigration policies created what Powell characterized as an “unusual and challenging”  slowdown in  supply of and demand for workers.
“It’s really an unusual kind of balance, the lower demand and lower need for workers,” Powell said.
He stressed that the central bank’s control of interest rates is its only tool, and that upheaval of the economy caused by artificial intelligence and structural labor force shifts were better solved through legislators and the private sector.
“We get a disproportionate amount of attention compared to the things that really matter, which are the things that Congress can do and the private sector can do,” Powell said.
Stocks started to slide after Powell spoke, with all major index averages falling. The S&P 500 was down more than 36 points when markets closed.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner and a host of state legislative and general officeholders, including House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos and General Treasurer James Diossa, also attended the Chamber event Tuesday. Gov. Dan McKee was not present, having appeared at a joint event in New London, Connecticut, with Gov. Ned Lamont to speak about offshore wind an hour earlier.

Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, announced her run for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District Tuesday, joining a growing field of Republicans aiming to take the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson.
In a social media post Tuesday morning, Lundgren announced her U.S. House campaign, kicking off by stating her early support for President Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle.
“I proudly supported President Trump in August of 2015 because I knew our country needed his strong leadership to get us back on track after decades of establishment politicians forgetting about working families and rural America,” Lundgren said in post. “In the 2024 caucuses, I proudly stood with him early again. Now, I’m stepping up to serve Iowans in Congress because President Trump needs that type of unwavering, loyal conservative fighters in Congress to deport illegal immigrants and make America safe, support our small businesses and working families, help Iowans afford housing and health care, protect Social Security and Medicare, and end the woke gender ideology that endangers our daughters.”
Lundgren has served for five terms in the Iowa House, chairing the House Commerce Committee, and is the owner and operator of Trackside Bar & Grill in Peosta alongside her husband, Charlie. She said that as a small business owner, she knows the struggles and needs of people and businesses in northeast Iowa, and that she would work in Congress to be “the strongest advocate for Iowa’s workers and small businesses who are the backbone of our American economy.”
“Charlie and I are excited to earn support across northeast Iowa,” Lundgren said. “We will keep this seat red and fight, fight, fight alongside President Trump to put Iowa and America first.”
With Lundgren’s announcement, there are now four Republicans running to become the 2nd Congressional District Republican nominee in the 2026 election. The race heated up quickly after Hinson, the incumbent, announced she will instead run for U.S. Senate after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst shared that she will not seek a third term in office.
Earlier in September, state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell announced their campaigns for the seat.
Blum announces campaign

Former U.S. Rep. Rod Blum joined the race on Friday. Blum, who previously represented northeast Iowa in Congress, was first elected to the U.S. House in 2014 before losing to former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat, in the 2018 midterm election.
Blum had hinted he would join the race shortly after Hinson’s Senate campaign launch. In his announcement, Blum said he would prioritize issues like border security, energy independence and strengthening the U.S. economy “through fair trade deals that put more money in the pockets of American workers” if elected to Congress.
The 70-year-old Dubuque resident said he was kickstarting his campaign with a personal $250,000 investment. Blum previously worked as CEO and president of Eagle Point Software, as well as the construction software company Digital Canal.
“We also need more Republicans in Washington who understand the business world and what it means to create jobs, balance budgets and make tough decisions,” Blum said in a statement. “I look forward to working hard every day to earn the Republican nomination, hold this seat for our Republican majority next November and get to work protecting our constitutional freedoms as Americans.”
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Katie Smith criticized the recently announced Republican candidates in the race, calling Lundgren “the latest out-of-touch Republican gearing up for a crowded, messy primary fight over who can best cater to Washington special interests and rubber stamp health care cuts and price-spiking tariffs.”
“Iowans deserve change, not more of the same corrupt Washington politics,” Smith said. “Democrats will flip this seat because voters are ready for someone who actually fights to lower their costs and puts them first.”
Rep. Lindsay James gains Star Trek actor’s endorsement
There are also three Democrats competing to become their party’s nominee in the 2nd District — Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College.
On Monday, James snagged the endorsement of an celebrity born in the district — actor Kate Mulgrew. Mulgrew, 70, was born in Dubuque, and is known for her roles in television shows like “Star Trek: Voyager,” and “Orange Is the New Black.” Mulgrew toured Feed Iowa First, a nonprofit urban farm in Marion, with James on Monday while offering her support for the candidate.
Mulgrew said she supported James’ bid for the seat because she believes James would be able to win in 2026, according to the Gazette.
“I came here to stand by her side and to give it a little push, because I think she’s going to flip this seat,” Mulgrew said. “… She’s got the passion and she’s got the fire in the belly to do it.”
The race for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District could be more contentious in 2026 than previously expected. Cook Political Report, a political forecaster, shifted the district’s rating from “solid Republican” to “likely Republican” following the September campaign shake-up.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)John Reid, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, on Tuesday launched Democrats for John Reid, a coalition of Virginia Democrats publicly lining up behind his candidacy — a twist that promises to sharpen contrasts with his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond. 
One of the most prominent defectors in the new group is former state Sen. Joe Morrissey, a Democrat whose career has long been marked by clashes with his own party.
“Virginians know that our commonwealth works best when we work together,” Reid said in a statement. “I am proud to have the support of Democrats who are standing up for common sense and for a government that is accountable to the people; not the political class in Richmond. Together, we’re building a broad coalition to move Virginia forward.”
The coalition is chaired by former International President of B’nai B’rith Tommy Baer, and includes a number of Richmond community leaders, working professionals, and former Democratic officials such as Kimberly Gray, Alexander Benedict McMurtrie Jr., Ajay Brewer and Christopher Woody. 
Reid’s campaign said these individuals are “putting people over politics” in supporting the Republican’s promise to be a check on Richmond’s political class and to focus on common sense solutions.
But it is Morrissey’s break that stands out. 
In an interview with The Mercury on Tuesday, he explained the reasons he will support Reid rather than Hashmi, citing personal experience serving with her in the Senate and disagreement over what he views as partisanship in her actions and policy positions. 
Among his complaints are that Hashmi “was strictly partisan, and did not do what was best, what I thought, for the commonwealth.” 
He contrasted that with Reid, saying he believes Reid will do a “much better job for Virginians.” He praised Reid’s emphasis on measurable improvements in schools and his attention to infrastructure — areas in which Morrissey said Hashmi has not been as outspoken or action-oriented.
Morrissey left no ambiguity: “It doesn’t matter who the other Democrats are that are supporting John, but my own reasons are that I served with Ghazala in the Senate. I know her behavior, mannerisms, her voting record, and because of that, I’m supporting John Reid.” 
He said he votes not for his party, but for what he thinks is best for Virginia — even under Democratic governors. 
He also addressed the fact that Reid is the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket in the commonwealth, saying “The fact that he is gay is irrelevant to whether or not you’ll be a great leader for Virginia,” but added that Reid is more open to “all sides,” in contrast with Hashmi, whom Morrissey characterized as aligned with the “far left crowd in Virginia.”
Despite his rejection of Hashmi in this race, Morrissey made clear he continues to support other Democrats on the ticket: Abigail Spanberger for governor and Jay Jones for attorney general. 
Morrissey’s long history in Virginia politics is well documented. He represented the 16th district in the State Senate from 2020 to 2024, following several terms in the House of Delegates. He has often positioned himself as a maverick within the Democratic Party, sometimes allying with Republicans or breaking with Democratic caucus positions — actions that have earned him rebukes from fellow party members.
And in 2014, while serving in the House, he was convicted on a misdemeanor charge stemming from allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year old receptionist in his law office. He entered an Alford plea to a felony charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, resigned his seat, and served a brief jail sentence while continuing to campaign. 
Despite the scandal, voters later returned him to the legislature, first re-electing him to the House and then to the state Senate. 
Hashmi, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, is a state senator from Virginia’s 15th district. She won a crowded six-way primary in June. If elected in November, she would make history as Virginia’s first Asian-American and Muslim statewide officeholder. Her campaign has emphasized her background as an educator, her record in the Senate on health, housing, education, and her work as chair of education and health committees.
Reid’s campaign is likely to use the newly formed Democratic coalition not just to highlight Democratic defections, but as proof of broader appeal beyond traditional Republican bases. 
Baer, the coalition’s chair, said in a statement, “This is no longer the party of John F. Kennedy or even Bill Clinton. It has moved to the extremes, and I can’t help but feel the party has left me. John Reid represents common-sense. His policies are designed to address the problems confronting the working class … he is pro-law enforcement … he will represent all the citizens … whether they be Christian, Jew, Muslim, or whatever walk of life they may come from.” 
Whether Morrissey’s criticism of Hashmi for being “strictly partisan” will resonate with moderate Democrats, independents, or swing voters remains to be seen. As the campaign heads into fall, Reid’s new coalition and Morrissey’s outspoken defection add another layer of complexity to what already is a closely watched race.

Root 5 Farm in Fairlee held their second annual Fermentation Celebration, inviting people to listen to bread bakers, beer makers and kombucha makers talk about their natural production methods, all of which involve fermentation.

This story by Nicola Smith was first published in the Valley News on Sept. 22, 2025.
FAIRLEE — In the last week, the dewy layer of morning frost on the fields has signaled that the Upper Valley’s growing season is winding down. But the warm days and cool nights benefit root vegetables such as carrots and turnips, and above-ground vegetables such as kale, brussel sprouts and cabbage, which are at their peak in the fall.
Cabbage is one of the staple crops at Root 5 Farm, which is on high ground overlooking the Connecticut River in Fairlee.
Owners Danielle Allen and Ben Dana operate a vegetable CSA and use the cabbage they grow in their homemade sauerkraut, or PowerKraut, which is made through natural fermentation. They also make kimchi, the Korean dish that blends cabbage, spices, garlic and ginger.
Over the weekend, Allen and Dana staged their second annual Fermentation Celebration. People throughout the Upper Valley and beyond came to listen to bread bakers, and makers of beer, mead and kombucha, talk about their natural production methods, all of which involve fermentation. The one-day event also showcased Root 5’s own produce.
“We eat everything we grow and ferment,” Allen said.
Allen and Dana started farming in the Burlington’s Intervale 20 years ago but decided to relocate to the Upper Valley after the Winooski River flooded their farm during Tropical Storm Irene. They bought the property, which was already an existing farm, in 2014.
Jars of sauerkraut, kimchi and fermented hot sauces are available to sample during a fermentation celebration at Root 5 Farm in Fairlee on Saturday, Sept. 20. The farm uses late-season cabbage that is harvested after a frost to make their fermented products, which lends an additional sweetness. “It’s something unique we can do in this region,” said farm owner Danielle Allen.

Last year the farm, under the direction of chef and chief fermenter Cindy Ross, made 8,000 pounds of sauerkraut and 3,000 pounds of kimchi, Allen said. The PowerKraut and kimchi are sold both on the farm and at stores throughout the Upper Valley.
Ross, who was at Fermentation Celebration overseeing a demonstration of sauerkraut making, said that the farm’s sauerkraut ferments in the natural brine created by the cabbage, salt and spices. She does not use vinegar.
Despite the attention paid to the health benefits of the fermentation method over the past 20 years, partially due to the writing of fermentation guru Sandor Katz, many people still don’t know much about it. “This is why we have today — for educational purposes,” Ross said.
Introducing people to foods that are made through fermentation is part of the Root 5 mission.

“We’re trying to be that first good experience, for people eating fermented foods,” Dana said. “Our sauerkraut is alive, not pasteurized. I love the living part of it, which is supposed to be probiotic.”
Probiotics are live microorganisms in such foods as yogurt, some cheeses, kefir and sauerkraut that are said to be beneficial in digestion, and in supporting the health of the immune system.
Not least, fermentation is a “way to explore the world’s foods,” Dana added.
Craft beer makers Billy and Brooke Martin, who are taking over Brocklebank Brewery in Tunbridge, described the yeast-based fermentation for their pilsners and IPAs as “doing all the work. We’re preparing a very tasty snack for yeast.” The beer makers impart subtle flavors to their beer with the addition of dandelions, red clover and currants.

Some in attendance at the event were attracted by the health benefits of fermented foods. Researchers at Stanford School of Medicine found in a controlled study in 2021 that a diet “rich in fermented foods enhances the diversity of gut microbes and decreases molecular signs of inflammation,” the School reported.
“I’m definitely sold on the idea of healthy bacteria for your gut,” said Connor Lawless, an Orford resident attending the celebration.
Others came to fermentation as a way to showcase area ingredients.

Alexandre Apfel, who owns Golden Rule Mead in Middlebury started the business six years ago, after he became interested in making natural wines. Calling himself a fermenter, Apfel uses fruit, herbs, honey and maple syrup in the production of the alcoholic mead.
“It matters what we’re making this stuff out of. I believe strongly in local food systems,” said Apfel, who works with beekeepers and gardeners in the Middlebury area. “I’m making a product that reflects the world around me.”
At the event, Suzanne Hawley, of Hanover, explored the products on sale and leafed through books on display. She is particularly interested in sourdough bread, which she makes at home using her own carefully-cultivated sourdough starter, which she named Zeke (short for Ezekiel).
Like Apfel, Hawley is drawn to the naturally occurring microcosmos of fermentation, in which the food or drink, in some ways, makes itself.
“It’s a living thing,” she said.

The institute is one place where families seek help and services for youths challenged with autism.(Courtesy of Munroe-Meyer Institute) LINCOLN — Nebraska officials for months have anticipated the federal government possibly stepping in to review soaring state expenses for autism-related services for youths, as has been the case elsewhere across the country.
This week, Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley beat them to the punch.
On Tuesday, Foley released his team’s examination of state costs to deliver Applied Behavioral Analysis services to Nebraskans. That’s a widely used therapeutic approach that helps youths with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.

The auditor’s 24-page report noted deficiencies such as a few duplicate claims for ABA services submitted by certain companies, resulting in what the auditor described as needless costs being paid by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.
Foley said in a statement that the audit sample was “quite limited” and that more instances likely would surface with broader reach. He said the report offers DHHS insight and another “roadmap on how to mitigate this problem.”
“DHHS has a full plate in front of it as it addresses the rapidly expanding population of citizens needing ABA services while trying to control the budgetary impact of service delivery,” Foley said.
 Review was welcomed

The review was requested by DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, Foley said. Its findings come as DHHS has implemented changes to the ABA program — sparking controversy and challenges from families and advocates for youths with autism.
In August, DHHS reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates to providers of the services. Months earlier, it created and approved new guardrails aimed at more efficiency and accountability.
 

 Rising incidences of autism 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that one in 31 youths are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder today, compared to one in 150 kids 25 years ago.
The National Institute of Mental Health defines the condition as a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn and behave. Though it can be diagnosed at any age, symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.



The attention came in light of ballooning state costs to provide ABA services. DHHS has said that before the August changes, Nebraska had the highest reimbursement rates of any state for the therapy. The agency said those higher rates contributed to the increase in state expenses from $4.6 million in 2000 to about $85.6 million last year.
State auditors said the number of companies working with DHHS through Heritage Health to deliver autism services to low-income and eligible young Nebraskans has nearly quadrupled in five years from 10 to 38.
DHHS Medicaid officials have said the agency’s recent efforts were intended to set clearer parameters, expectations and to rein in potential overauthorization of services. They said they’re cognizant and have monitored federal audits and multimillion-dollar fines levied against other states’ Medicaid-covered behavioral health programs, and want to minimize the risk to the state of federal efforts to claw back funds. 
Earlier this month, Nebraska lawmakers held a public hearing to hear how the recent state cuts to Medicaid reimbursement for ABA services had affected Nebraska and its youngest members on the autism spectrum. The hearing was part of an interim study to inform the Legislature how it might help ensure the viability of Medicaid-funded ABA services.
Foley said his team’s audit did not play a role in DHHS’ decision to revise reimbursement rates. He believes the rates were the driving reason for fast-rising costs and said the auditor’s review could provide insight into internal deficiencies that could lead to better efficiencies.
The audit, Foley said, revealed examples of costly, “erroneous” claims for reimbursement filed with the managed care organizations that process claims for the state’s Medicaid program and a need for better support documentation. 
Among deficiencies noted by state auditors:

Two claims appeared to be duplicate payments of claims previously paid, leading to potential overpayment of about $29,500.
A “significant number of claims” lacked adequate information on service providers. “Testing revealed, moreover, that the service provider designated in the claim data did not agree to the actual service provider for 87 of the 179 claims tested,” the report said.
Several providers “lacked professional credentials to be a service provider yet successfully billed DHHS for services,” Foley said. The audit report said lax qualification checks increase risk for children not receiving appropriate care. 
Limited testing showed one claim paid at a rate more than three times the approved Medicaid reimbursement rate, resulting in overpayment of $603. The provider agreed to repay the amount, the auditors noted.

The audit recommended continued review and update of service definitions for the ABA program and more specific guidance on documenting claims.
DHHS, in an overall response included in the audit report, said the agency appreciated the review that it asked for: “This collaborative effort provides the department with an objective review of the ABA program, which will be used to make program improvements.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)West Virginia National Guard personnel deployed to Washington, D.C. could be there until the end of November, but there’s no definite end to the operations. 
More than 300 members of the West Virginia National Guard have been in Washington, D.C., for more than a month as part of President Donald Trump’s unprecedented initiative “to restore cleanliness and safety” to the nation’s capital. 
“Currently, we are expecting all members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed for Operation DC Safe & Beautiful to be released from active duty prior to Nov. 30, 2025,” a spokesperson for the National Guard told West Virginia Watch in an email. 
“As with all military operations, that date may change based on operational needs as they occur. Our Guard is proud to support the President’s initiative to keep our Nation’s Capital safe and to demonstrate our commitment to a strong and secure America,” the statement said. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a staunch ally of Trump, ordered West Virginia National Guard members to Washington, D.C. in August following a request from the president. The deployment is federally funded, according to the governor’s office. Other Republican-led states, including Tenenssee and Ohio, have sent troops to the capital.  
There are around 2,500 guard members stationed throughout Washington, D.C, and they’re not authorized to make arrests. Troops have been patrolling alongside local police while also removing trash, mulching and removing graffiti in the city, Axios reports.
Last week, West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey co-led an amicus brief in support of the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C.
“The President has the authority, and the duty, to protect our nation’s capital,” McCuskey said in a statement. “The lawlessness in Washington, D.C., the result of years of soft-on-crime policies, was putting our nation at risk and finally, we have a President willing to step up to secure it.”
Violent crime is declining in the city, hitting a 30-year low in 2024, according to the Justice Department. 
Attorneys general from 22 other states are pushing back on Trump’s actions, supporting D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb’s lawsuit challenging the deployment of National Guard troops to the nation’s capital.
The attorneys general argue the deployment infringes on the police powers reserved to states and localities, and states need their national guards to respond to natural disasters and security at high-profile events.
Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. is estimated to cost taxpayers roughly $200 million, reports USA Today. That figure doesn’t include the price of deploying personnel from additional states.

Visiting America’s national parks is a treasured public pastime. The wetlands of Congaree in South Carolina, the depths of the Grand Canyon in Arizona and the vistas provided by peaks in Yosemite in California are iconic American experiences for residents and for people who travel from other countries to vacation.
There are lots of benefits of visiting national parks, or parks in general. Spending time in nature is good for people’s mental health.
Moving in the outdoors – walking, biking, running, paddling – benefits people’s physical health. Sharing experiences with others helps build social connections with old friends or newfound ones. Visitors also learn about ecosystems and cultural history, developing their own relationship to the landscape.
National park visitation is growing, with record-high visitor numbers in 2024 across the entire 398-property system, as well as at the 63 formally designated national parks. And there has been a general trend of people gravitating to Instagram-popular parks, and even specific spots within popular parks.
Reductions in federal funding and staffing at national parks means visitors may see longer lines to enter parks or popular locations within them, fewer visitor services and educational programs, and fewer rangers to ask for advice or assistance.
As scholars of parks and recreation, we know crowded conditions make it harder to enjoy national parks. But we also know that if you plan carefully, you can create a great experience.

What gets in the way of fun?
In general, research identifies three main barriers to recreational fun.
One is how confident people are in their own physical abilities and how safe they feel in the park. For example, someone may want to go kayaking in Florida’s Everglades or Minnesota’s Voyageurs National Park but doesn’t know where to rent a boat, where to put it in the water, or which stretches of water are best for a beginner.

Another is the presence – or absence – of people to enjoy the space with, or family obligations or relationships that might preclude them from an activity.
Culture can also play a role in where people visit and what they do there.
For instance, a national park may be a source of escape where individuals seek autonomy and independence. For others, a national park visit can be a focal point for social gatherings and a time to reconnect with family and friends.
There are also external factors, like how much free time a person has for recreation and how easy it is to get to a national park from their home.
Someone may live a short drive from a national park but not visit simply because they do not know what they can do there, or how to have a positive experience.
More recently, research has also identified environmental barriers outside visitors’ control.
Thin ice or lack of snow prevents many winter activities in Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park and Maine’s Acadia National Park, just as excessive heat can decrease the attractiveness of summer recreation in parks like the Everglades or California’s Death Valley.
Extreme weather events such as inland flooding and coastal hurricanes can block roads and damage parks, posing both physical and logistical barriers in parks such as Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina.
Wildlife habits also affect visitors, who may flock to an area where they can see wildlife. Or they may avoid – or may be restricted from – areas with dangerous wildlife.
Adapting to find enjoyment anyway
If the national park places you want to visit seem too busy, think about your options. You could change your travel dates to a less busy time. People who want to visit Yellowstone in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana could find campground reservations unavailable for some weeks but plentiful for other weeks – or they could choose to stay in a local hotel instead of camping.
You could try a different park or activity. For example, an angler who typically visits Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee to fish for trout may find that some streams are warming and no longer support this activity. They might go fishing elsewhere or stay in the Smokies and bird-watch, hike or read by a stream.
If you really want to visit during a busy time, you can also simply change your expectations, like not expecting Old Faithful to be a quiet place with only a few visitors.
Park personnel often seek to manage visitor numbers to protect the park from too much traffic, but also so everyone who visits can enjoy the experience. For example, implementing reservations for Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain at sunrise means at least some people get a relatively serene experience, as opposed to lots of people having an overcrowded experience.
Park staff also design park amenities so roads, boat ramps, trailheads and parking are in useful locations that work well for the number of visitors expected.
And park workers provide advance information for visitors, in brochures and on websites, charge fees for entry, conduct tours or other programs at the location – and ticket or arrest people who are in places or doing activities they’re not supposed to – to reduce the effects of overcrowding.
Reservations are required to enter Haleakalā National Park in Maui between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. to view sunrise from the summit of the volcano that rises more than 10,000 feet above sea level. Originally part of Hawaii National Park, Haleakalā (which means “house of the sun” in Hawaiian) became a separate national park in 1961. (Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette)
Planning is key
We have found that the most effective way for people to have the park experiences they want, and enjoy them as much as they hope, is to plan ahead.
Planning can include looking at parks’ websites for ideas and considering the best time to visit – both for your own schedule and what you want to do.
Understanding the weather and climate of the region will help you determine what to bring, but also what conditions will be like if you’re hiking, paddling or driving.
Advance preparation definitely includes finding lodging – and making reservations whenever possible.
If reservations aren’t possible, see whether you can increase your chances of finding a place to sleep when you arrive by choosing lesser-visited parts of the park or identifying nearby backup options, such as state parks and private campgrounds, that might provide a break from the crowds.
And you can make sure you’re prepared for whatever you’re going to do, whether it’s getting used to walking long distances before a big hike or learning about local flora and fauna before you arrive.
Thinking ahead also means you can share your itinerary with friends and family – either as invitations to join you or for periodic safety check-ins.
It is also helpful to talk to park personnel. Park staff will have great insights into hidden gems that might be slightly off the beaten path but away from the crowds and able to provide a unique visitor experience. Rangers or other staff can help you determine the best choices for settings and activities that match your abilities, interests, time and needs.
And finally, don’t forget to be considerate of other visitors. Have patience in the parking lots, visitor centers, trailheads and lookout points. Others in the park seek the same awe-inspiring views and heart-pumping recreation activities as you. In many cases, it’s not the number of people but the attitudes and behaviors of those people that can make a place either feel crowded or like a community of like-minded outdoor enthusiasts.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A Republican vacancy committee appointed Second Amendment activist Ava Flanell to represent Colorado’s House District 14 on Monday night.
Flanell will replace former Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, who resigned about one week ago. Republicans chose Rep. Jarvis Caldwell to replace Pugliese as minority leader.
“Ava is a small business owner, firearms instructor, and grassroots leader who has been a strong voice for protecting our Second Amendment rights. She will work tirelessly for the families of El Paso County and be a dedicated partner in our caucus,” Caldwell said in a Tuesday statement.

The El Paso County Republican Party did not have information about other candidates for the vacant position, the number of people in the vacancy committee or the vote breakdown when reached Tuesday morning.
Flanell hosts a podcast about the firearms industry and has a large online following. She regularly testifies at the Colorado Capitol against firearm regulations, including this year’s law mandating safety training for most semiautomatic rifle purchases. She has owned Elite Firearms and Training in Colorado Springs since 2013.
“I am not a career politician. I bring a fresh perspective with over a decade of experience as a small business owner, firearms instructor, and gun rights advocate. Like many of you, I have dedicated my time, talent, and treasure to the grassroots work of helping to flip seats and defend our conservative principles,” she wrote in a social media post announcing her intent to run for the vacant seat. The post was accompanied by a photo with her and President Donald Trump.
Flanell joins two other Republicans who were appointed during the interim: Rep. Scott Slaugh replaced former Rep. Ryan Armagost and Sen. Lynda Zamora Wilson in Senate District replaced former Sen. Paul Lundeen.
The Legislature is set to reconvene in January. Democrats control strong majorities in both chambers.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)IDAHO FALLS – If Idaho is going to lead a nuclear renaissance in America, Idaho legislators and other policy makers must focus on workforce development, training and educational opportunities, Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said. 
Wagner emphasized the importance of workforce development and education during the Western Governors’ Association’s two-day Energy Superabundance conference held Monday and Tuesday at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls.  
‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

During the conference, Wagner told Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox that America is in the middle of a nuclear renaissance and Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of building and permitting new nuclear reactors for the first time in 50 years to help meet the country’s increasing energy demands. 
To tackle the challenge and lead the renaissance, Idaho will need a robust workforce with a variety of skills, Wagner said. 
“When you think about your path, fast forward, and we’re building out many reactors in the West and beyond. It’s not just about nuclear engineers anymore,” Wagner said in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun. “It’s about welders. It’s about all the different crafts. It’s about nuclear operators.”
SUB: Idaho National Laboratory director says Launch program can help state’s workforce pipeline
Wagner said Little’s Idaho Launch program, which provides up to $8,000 for Idaho students to receive career-technical training or enroll in eligible higher education programs tied to in-demand careers, is an excellent program that he supports.
“Making that easier to get first-generation college graduates into the pipeline is fantastic,” Wagner told the Sun. “I myself am a first generation college graduate, so l love that. That’s a great example of what can be done.”
Little has continuously championed the Idaho Launch program, but funding has come under fire over the past two years by conservative Republican legislators looking to reduce state spending. 
Wagner also said new workforce training initiatives need to be launched. He suggested Idaho legislators could look to the Navy Nuclear Power School for ideas and best practices to replicate in Idaho. The Navy Nuclear Power School is a technical training program that helps train enlisted students and officers in math, physics and other disciplines to prepare students to work in nuclear power for the Navy. 










When you think about your path, fast forward, and we're building out many reactors in the West and beyond. It's not just about nuclear engineers anymore. It's about welders. It's about all the different crafts. It's about nuclear operators.


– John Wagner, Idaho National Laboratory director


Wagner did not have a specific proposal to put forward, but suggested Idaho elected officials could leverage the state’s existing higher education institutions like the College of Eastern Idaho, Idaho State University, Boise State University, University of Idaho and more to develop a workforce training program to prepare students to work at Idaho National Laboratory or in the nuclear industry. 
Wagner said he has met with leaders in Utah and Idaho about creating the equivalent of a nuclear power school located in the West.
“How do you leverage what’s there, adjust the curriculum, and provide that sort of package?” Wagner said. “I would love to see us do something like that.”
Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell also emphasized the importance of developing a competent and reliable workforce when he spoke Monday during the Energy Superabundance conference at INL.
“My biggest concern I shared with (Govs. Little and Cox): the highest hurdle to success, going forward, is workforce,” Crowell said Monday. “That’s workforce both for trade and scientists and engineers, et cetera. In the private sector, there’s not enough there – they are hiring actively. And on the government side, in the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) we have serious current workforce shortcomings that are going to be exacerbated going forward.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Idaho National Laboratory has hired 700 to 1,000 employees per year recently

As one of the state’s largest employers, Idaho National Laboratory will continue to need a robust and skilled workforce, Wagner said. 
The INL has experienced significant growth in the past seven years, Wagner said. It increased its workforce from about 4,000 employees roughly seven years ago to about 6,000 employees today.
Over the past couple of years, the Idaho National Laboratory has hired between 700 and 1,000 people a year, Wagner said. Although he does not see that level of growth continuing now that he views INL’s staff as “right-sized,” Wagner said the lab will need to continue to hire staff due to attrition, retirement and the need for specialized skills and positions. 
“Which is still significant when you’re talking about 6,000 people,” Wagner said. “So we will continue to have those needs.”
Wagner said Idaho National Laboratory employees have not been subject to workforce reductions, early retirement buyouts and deferred resignations that have affected the federal government this year, because INL employees are not federal employees. The U.S. Department of Energy owns the laboratory, but it hires a contractor, Battelle Energy Alliance, to operate and manage the lab. Instead of being federal employees, the Idaho National Laboratory’s workforce are Battelle Energy Alliance employees.
The Energy Superabundance conference wrapped up Tuesday.
On Monday, Little and Cox spoke about the significant increase in projected energy demand, which is fueled in part by the growth of AI data centers and large commercial/industrial projects. On Monday, Little created a new Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force, which he says replaces and modernizes the Idaho Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE Commission, that his predecessor, former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, created.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville after a jury convicted him in a federal corruption case. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Six years after being bounced from the Tennessee House speakership, former Rep. Glen Casada was sentenced Tuesday to 36 months in prison for his role in a kickback scheme.
U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson meted out the punishment to Casada on 14 counts of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering in connection with a shell company called Phoenix Solutions run by his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, who was sentenced to 30 months last week.
Casada also must pay a $30,000 fine and remain on probation for one year once he serves his time. Defense attorneys said they will appeal the case to a higher court.
Attorneys for Casada and Cothren requested a mistrial during their four-week trial that stretched from mid-April into May after prosecutors inadvertently played an unredacted recording of an FBI interview with Casada that incriminated Cothren. They also sought a new trial just before sentencing, but Richardson denied the request.
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up the secret company that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Casada’s attorneys argued Tuesday that he was merely trying to start a new business, Right Way Consulting, that caught the eye of federal investigators.
Richardson acquitted Casada and Cothren of three counts of fraudulently obtaining state property because the prosecution was unable to prove they were agents of the state.
Cothren resigned from his chief of staff post in early 2019 amid a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada stepped down from the speaker’s post following a no-confidence vote spurred by heavy-handed leadership and the scandal surrounding Cothren. 
He remained in the General Assembly for one more term, though, when he got involved with Cothren and Smith in the Phoenix Solutions scheme. The trio tried to conceal Cothren’s identity because of his resignation and direct business to Phoenix Solutions. In turn, they received money from the business in the form of kickbacks, according to federal prosecutors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Two men arrested earlier this month after police found a bomb under a news vehicle now face charges stemming from the search of their home.
Adeeb Nasir, 58, and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir, 31, are each charged with two counts of manufacturing, possessing, selling or using a weapon of mass destruction, both second-degree felonies.
Adeeb Nasir also faces two third-degree felony charges of possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person due to controlled substance use.
The two men are being held without bail as the investigation continues.
The charges filed late Monday do not mention the suspicious device that was found under a news vehicle Sept. 12 while it was parked next to an occupied building in Salt Lake City. Jail booking affidavits for the two men said the incendiary device was real and had been lit, but the fuse malfunctioned. 
FOX 13 News reported the targeted vehicle was part of its fleet.  
According to the charges, investigators executed a search warrant on the men’s home on the 2700 South block of 8500 West found what appeared to be a stick of dynamite with a blasting cap and fuse in a kitchen cabinet, and another in Adeeb Nasir’s bedroom closet. Because the men told investigators the explosives were real, the home and surrounding area were evacuated.
Bomb technicians determined the dynamite was fake, the charges say.
Investigators also found marijuana and multiple firearms in the home.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident. In a statement, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said his office cannot comment on the federal investigation. 
News of the incendiary device under a Utah news vehicle is not the first case of an apparent attack on media this month. On Friday, shots were fired through a window of the ABC10 news building, according to the Sacramento Bee. A Sacramento man, 64-year-old Anibal Hernandez Santana, faces three felony charges of firing a gun at an inhabited building, assault with a deadly weapon and firing a gun in a negligent manner, the Bee reported.

UVM Larner College of Medicine alumna Imelda Muller is one of NASA’s 10 new astronaut candidates, out of a pool of 8,000, the space agency announced Monday. 
“With upcoming exploration missions, we are pushing the boundaries of human performance. The lessons that we learn, the knowledge that we gain, all of these things are going to help us excel not just in space but in areas of human health here on Earth. The future of medicine is now, and I’m incredibly honored to be here with this team, Muller said during NASA’s announcement at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. 
Muller, an anesthesiologist, graduated from the medical school in 2017 and then worked as an undersea medical officer following training at the Naval Undersea Medical Institute, in Connecticut. She studied in the Naval Medical Center in San Diego and became a naval lieutenant. She did her residency in anesthesia and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
“That experience gave me the opportunity to work with multidisciplinary teams in experimental and saturation diving, and I developed a passion for learning about the way the body adapts in extreme environments,” Muller said at the announcement event. “This led me to pursue medical residency training in anesthesia, where I deepened that understanding of how our body responds when it’s under stress. I am incredibly excited to be here alongside this team and to build on that foundation.”
Before coming to UVM, Muller studied behavioral neuroscience as an undergraduate at Northeastern University.  
Now, she and the other nine candidates will go through two years of NASA training to become eligible for flight assignments. The program will include spacewalk simulations and survival training.
Muller is one of two in the astronaut training class with a medical background and, at 34, is one of the youngest on the team.  
“The UVM community is thrilled to see Dr. Imelda Muller joining NASA’s newest cadre of astronaut candidates,” UVM President Marlene Tromp said in the university’s press release. She also attended the announcement event at the Johnson Space Center. 
UVM is part of the Vermont Space Grant Consortium, a NASA partner program that connects those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics projects with opportunities to work with the space agency. Many Larner students have participated in a four-week Aerospace Medicine Clerkship at the Johnson Space Center.

,DC,2025-09-23 19:26:45+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,'Your countries are going to hell': Trump lashes out at world leaders at UN,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/your-countries-are-going-hell-trump-lashes-out-world-leaders-un,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump harshly criticized fellow world leaders Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly days after key allies of the United States recognized a Palestinian state, and as NATO vows to defend Europe amid recent Russian air incursions.During his nearly hour-long address at the annual meeting in New York City, Trump briefly brushed on the Israel-Hamas war and his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the U.S. president focused much of his attention on the “double-tailed monster” of immigration and energy that he said will cause Europe to “fail.”“Your countries are going to hell,” Trump said, later adding: “And I'm really good at predicting things.” “I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail. And if you don't stop people that you've never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail,” Trump continued.Trump said the U.S. stands “ready to provide any country with abundant, affordable energy supplies if you need them, when most of you do,” and specifically encouraged the purchase of U.S. oil and gas.The president attacked multilateral agreements to combat climate change, namely the Paris Climate Accord, and panned the overwhelmingly accepted science as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion.”Trump blames UN for faulty escalator, teleprompterTrump attacked the U.N. as a body numerous times throughout his speech, including for what he claimed were a faulty escalator and teleprompter Tuesday.“I don't mind making this speech without a teleprompter, because the teleprompter is not working. I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless, and that way you speak more from the heart, I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” Trump said at the top of his remarks.Trump claimed he ended “seven wars” without the help of the U.N.“All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen, but she's in great shape. We're both in good shape. We both stood,” he said. “And then a teleprompter that didn't work. These are the two things I got from the United Nations, a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter. Thank you very much.”U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock refuted Trump’s claim following his speech, saying, “As we are receiving queries, I would like to assure you that don’t worry, the U.N. teleprompters are working perfectly.”Trump meets with ZelenskyyTrump’s remarks came after negotiations to end Russia’s continued invasion into Ukraine have failed, despite Trump welcoming Putin to Alaska last month.Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for roughly an hour on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting Tuesday afternoon, where Trump said “we have great respect for the fight that Ukraine is putting up. It’s pretty amazing actually.”Zelenskyy said he would brief the president on “good news” from the battlefield and said “we will continue until Russia will stop this war.”Zelenskyy also highlighted conversations with European leaders regarding cutting off dependence on Russian oil and gas.When asked by the press if he thinks NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace, Trump responded “Yes, I do,” according to journalists traveling with him. Trump added it “depends on the circumstance” whether or not the U.S. would back up NATO allies.When asked for an update on negotiations with Putin and if he still trusts the Russian president, Trump told reporters “I'll let you know in about a month from now.” Gaza crisisThe U.S. president’s speech to world leaders also comes after Israel all but blindsided the U.S. two weeks ago with a strike on Qatar, a key Middle East ally that hosts both a massive U.S. military presence as well as the Hamas political offices. Trump received applause as he called for Hamas militants to release the remaining hostages kidnapped from Israel nearly two years ago during the group’s brutal attack. But he criticized any recognition of a Palestinian state as “a reward for these horrible atrocities.”On Monday, France joined more than 150 countries to recognize Palestinian statehood. The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal declared recognition Sunday.Numerous world leaders, including those from Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey and Jordan, spoke on the assembly floor Tuesday about the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities. The U.N. has declared a famine in the roughly 25-mile-long coastal strip that borders Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.“The terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas are indefensible from any angle, but nothing, absolutely nothing, justifies the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said before Trump took the floor.“Under tons of rubble are buried tens of thousands of innocent women and children. There we can see that international humanitarian law and the myth of ethical exceptionalism of the West are also being buried there. This massacre would not have happened without the complicity of those who could have prevented it,” da Silva said.Trump touts mass deportationsAdministration officials seated at the U.S. table in the assembly hall included Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and recently confirmed U.N. Ambassador Mike Waltz, according to journalists traveling with the president. Trump touted his domestic policies, including mass deportations and sending federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to Democratic-led American cities. “Our message is very simple, if you come illegally into the United States, you're going to jail, or you're going back to where you came from, or perhaps even further than that. You know what that means,” Trump said.He then thanked the El Salvadoran government for its “successful and professional job they've done in receiving and jailing so many criminals that entered our country.”The U.S. agreed to pay El Salvador $4.76 million in March to detain up to 300 immigrant men, many of them Venezuelan nationals, for up to a year at a notorious mega-prison where several maintain they faced physical and psychological torture. Many argue they were wrongfully deported and are not affiliated with criminal gangs the administration has targeted.Brazil, VenezuelaTrump also lauded his global tariff policy as his strategy to “defend our sovereignty and security throughout the world, including against nations that have taken advantage of former U.S. administrations for decades.”He called out da Silva by name, saying he and the Brazilian leader quickly agreed before he walked on the floor to meet next week.“I'm very sorry to say this, Brazil is doing poorly and will continue to do poorly. They can only do well when they're working with us,” Trump said.Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods coming into the U.S. after its Supreme Court prosecuted former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup. Trump has dubbed the prosecution a “witch hunt.”The U.S. Supreme Court will take up the question in November on whether Trump’s sweeping global tariffs are legal.Trump also remarked on the U.S. military’s increased activity in the Caribbean Sea.“Let's put it this way, people don't like taking big loads of drugs in boats anymore,” he said, referring to recent deadly U.S. strikes on boats near the coast of Venezuela.The administration alleges the boats are involved in illegal drug smuggling. Trump’s use of deadly military force against the vessels has drawn both criticism and praise from U.S. lawmakers.",,,,2025-09-23 15:58:15.872027

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal judge has cleared the way for work to resume on an offshore wind farm in New England, ruling Monday that the Trump administration failed to justify its order to stop work on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project.
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the administration had failed to substantiate its claims that the project would cause national security risks, the Rhode Island Current reported, calling the order “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”
Lamberth said the government’s stop-work order jeopardized the $6.2 billion project, causing “irreparable harm.” The project, which is 80% complete, is slated to provide more than 700 megawatts of power by the end of 2026. 
Trump has crushed offshore wind plans, but states haven’t quite given up hope

State leaders and grid operators in New England have said the Trump administration’s order is a threat to grid reliability and energy prices. Revolution Wind, which will provide power to Connecticut and Rhode Island, will make up about 2.5% of the power across New England. 
The attorneys general in Connecticut and Rhode Island joined project developers in suing the government, asking for work to resume. 
“The Trump Administration should see the writing on the wall with this decision and drop its defense of their indefensible actions,” Connecticut Attorney General Tong said in a statement. “Every day that this project is stymied is a day of lost employment, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and another day burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach.”
Project developers for Revolution Wind said they will resume work as quickly as possible. Trump officials did not say whether they will appeal the ruling. 
President Donald Trump has waged an all-out assault on offshore wind, halting leases for new projects, revoking permits, canceling funding to support manufacturing and ports, and threatening even projects that are under construction. 
Last week, the Interior Department sought to remand approvals for projects it had previously permitted in Maryland and New England, The New Bedford Light reported.

Ron DeSantis’ administration against local governments, city leaders pushed back Tuesday in a Florida House meeting focused on cutting property taxes.
“Waste is in the eye of the beholder,” said Casey Cook, the Florida League of Cities’ chief of legislative affairs. “Nobody likes paying taxes, but safe isn’t free. Clean isn’t free.”
Cook, joined by other county and city leaders, spoke Tuesday morning during the Florida House’s fourth meeting of the Select Committee on Property Taxes, hosted to explore the best way to slash the “most hated tax” and bring relief to Floridians struggling under the weight of rising costs.
DeSantis and top leaders have targeted local governments over property tax levels, decrying city and county officials for alleged rampant “waste, fraud, and abuse” at a slew of statewide press conferences.
But on Tuesday, local government officials took the public stage for the first time to claim that that’s not true.
“One person’s community amenity could be the next person’s biggest waste ever,” Cook said, noting the subjectivity of how property tax allocations can benefit some citizens and over-tax others. “And one person’s exemption is another person’s tax increase.”
Property taxes vary city to city and county to county, contributing roughly 47% of public school funding statewide. They also help pay for public safety operations, which include law enforcement, fire stations, and emergency management. In 2024, counties spent a total of $60.17 billion, $16.13 billion of which went to public safety, said Davin Suggs, deputy executive eirector of the Florida Association of Counties.

Vicki Lopez, a Miami Republican who co-chairs the Florida House’s property tax committee, said that the local governments’ presentations made her more clearly understand the case-by-case basis that different cities and counties operate on when it comes to property tax, making a one-size-fits-all approach to the dilemma far less likely, she told reporters after the four-hour meeting.
“I do believe that today we’ve learned maybe there are some counties and cities that are doing it right, and maybe there are counties and cities that need a little help in reducing their expenses,” Lopez said, adding that she looks forward to the Florida DOGE team’s findings from the seven counties and five municipalities they’ve investigated.
Despite the difficulty, Lopez and co-chair Rep. Toby Overdorf, a Palm City Republican, “absolutely” believe that at least one constitutional amendment on property taxes will be on the ballot in 2026.
What is DOGE doing for property taxes?
DeSantis has repeatedly called for property tax cuts to ease homeowners’ financial burdens. He pressured the Florida Legislature during the 2025 session for property tax relief, but lawmakers struggled to determine how to balance slashing property taxes while still funding key public institutions.
To address the situation, the House created a 37-member property tax committee while DeSantis directed his new DOGE team to investigate local governments for alleged “waste, fraud, and abuse” — some of which he claims is driving up property tax rates.
On Tuesday, Leda Kelly, director of the Office of Policy and Budget in the Executive Office of the Governor, presented an overview of the Florida DOGE team. She faced minimal questioning from lawmakers, but insisted the team remains “committed” to locating efficiency and stomping out inefficiency across local governments.
Democrat Rep. Anna Eskamani, representing Orlando, isn’t so sure.
“I do find it ironic that the search for efficiency can be so inefficient,” she said. Eskamani referenced DOGE hiring a team leader, Eric Soskin, while “co-opting” other department employees into the task force.
Cook touched on a similar vein when he was asked to detail the salaries of local government workers in a question hinting at some city managers who rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars. Cook pointed out that nearly 2,000 state employees make more than DeSantis’s $141K yearly salary. Beyond that, DeSantis’ cost of living is nearly entirely footed by the taxpayer, he said.
“The governor has a security detail, his family has a security detail, the governor has a driver, probably part of the security detail, and when the governor travels, he travels on a private plane,” Cook said, adding that DeSantis lives in Tallahassee’s Governor’s Mansion.
“If you were to break that down with a total cost to the taxpayer, I would wager that the typical city manager makes less than 10-20 times the total compensation of the governor.”
One of those state employees who makes more than the governor is Soskin. His salary is more than $197K.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The son of a Calhoun County woman murdered in 1997 urged Gov. Kay Ivey Tuesday to stop Thursday’s planned execution of the man convicted of killing her.
Will Berry, the son of Margaret Parrish Barry, requested that Ivey halt the execution for West before accompanying a group to deliver a petition to the Governor’s Office signed by people who opposed the execution scheduled for Thursday.
“There shouldn’t be any more dead,” Will Berry said to the roughly 20 people who attended the event. “There should be healing and moving forward with this. I would like a relationship with Geoffrey West and his family from here on out. I do not want this man to die.”

West was convicted by a jury in 1999 for his role in the murder of Margaret Parrish in 1997. His execution is scheduled to take place in a 30-hour window starting at midnight on Thursday until 6 a.m. by nitrogen gas, and so far, West does not have any appeals pending in attempts to stop the pending execution.
Berry, who has written about his desire to meet West,  said that he and his family had forgiven West and did not want Alabama to carry out the execution in his name.
“Forgiveness is a commandment,” Will Berry said in an interview on Monday. “It helps me in my own heart with the Lord. Vengeance is the Lord’s, not mine or the state of Alabama. I don’t want his mother to have to go through this, or his family.”
Berry said the path to forgiveness began years ago when he said to his spouse that he wanted to help West get out from death row.
He said he requested a meeting with West but that the Alabama Department of Corrections denied his request, citing policy, according to Will Berry.
“I would not ask him anything,” Will Berry said. “I would tell him I love him, I forgive him. My mother forgives him. We love him and his family.”
A spokesperson for the ADOC said that the request was denied because it would violate the department’s policy to allow families of the victim to meet with the person scheduled to be executed.
“An individual who is a victim of an inmate will not be approved to visit,” the administrative regulation states about people who want to visit the person to be executed.
A message was sent to Ivey Tuesday seeking comment.
As of Tuesday afternoon, there have not been any new appeals filed to challenge the scheduled execution.
Ivey scheduled West’s execution in July.
According to court documents, a jury convicted West of capital murder in 1999 after he and his girlfriend at the time entered an Etowah County convenience store that he previously worked to rob the location. Margaret Berry was working at the convenience store when West shot and killed her, later taking $250 from the store.
If the execution takes place on Friday, it will be fourth execution in Alabama for 2025 , and the third time it will use nitrogen gas as the method of execution.
Alabama executed Demetrius Terrence Frazier in February and Gregory Hunt in June, both times by nitrogen gas. It also put James Osgood to death by lethal injection in April.
Ivey said she scheduled the execution of Anthony Boyd in October by nitrogen gas while the execution of David Lee Roberts was delayed after Marion County Circuit Judge Lee Carter issued a stay of execution to have him evaluated to determine his mental capacity to be executed.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7401-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 15:58:15.872027

Political violence is no longer an abstract threat but a heavy reality for Americans.
In recent months, we have seen Pennsylvania’s Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family targeted during Passover, a Minnesota state legislator and her husband assassinated in their own home, another Minnesota legislator and his wife shot  and now the high-profile killing of Charlie Kirk at a college campus rally. Most Americans are struggling to make sense of the state of our union.
Political fallout related to Kirk’s assassination has been immediate with a chilling effect spreading beyond violence itself.
ABC talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was yanked off the air temporarily for remarks he made about Kirk’s death. Both private citizens and public figures face the threat of professional ruin for speaking, or being perceived as speaking, too freely.

America is wounded. And the role of public officials should be obvious: lower the temperature, uphold the rule of law and safeguard citizens’ rights. Instead, state Auditor Shad White – the first millennial to serve in statewide office in Mississippi – chose to weaponize his platform and power against two women for expressing their views on their personal social media accounts.
On Sept. 11, Auditor White logged onto Facebook and X where he published the headshot, contact information and social media account of a University of Mississippi employee. Two days later, he doxed another Mississippian — a small business owner in Lucedale. With the Lucedale woman, White took it a step further and advised: “Everyone, I would buy from a differently owned local business if I were you.”
What followed should have been predictable and completely foreseeable to a Harvard-trained lawyer like White. Both women and their families received threats. Both now face the possibility of losing livelihoods and reputations they worked years to build.
This was not auditing. This was intimidation. This was the state’s chief watchdog turning his authority into a cudgel against his own constituents.
As state auditor, White has lawful tools at his disposal if he truly believes a public employee engaged in misconduct: internal reviews, disciplinary referrals, even formal investigations. Those mechanisms ensure due process that is the constitutional safeguard protecting every American from arbitrary government action.
White substituted the rule of law for online outrage in direct retaliation against private citizens for speech protected by the First Amendment.
When government officials weaponize their office to punish speech, it doesn’t just chill debate. It endangers lives. The predictable harassment these women now face is not an unfortunate accident; it is the natural consequence of a public official broadcasting their personal information to an inflamed audience of more than 38,000 followers.
What White did is not just bad judgment but an abuse of office. Elected officials swear an oath to their constituents and are bound by fiduciary duties to the taxpayers they serve. Using state resources and official platforms for personal political gain violates that trust and exposes the state, and its taxpayers, to legal liability.
It also sets a precedent no Mississippian wants: Your livelihood, your safety and your family can be put at risk at the whim of a politician chasing clicks. Today, it’s two women who criticized Charlie Kirk. Tomorrow, it could be anyone who dares to speak against those in power.
The irony should not escape anyone: White, who publicly champions Christian conservative values, singled out two vulnerable women at a moment when violence against political dissent dominates national headlines.
True leadership requires empathy and restraint. In his post about the woman in Lucedale, White wrote: “There is no place for political violence in America, even if you disagree with (Kirk).” It is baffling that White condemns political violence when it suits his brand of politics but remains silent while his own actions incite harassment against the very people he swore an oath to protect.
I’ve spent my career representing people and businesses facing government overreach and government failure, often when the stakes are high and emotion flows freely. What happened here in Mississippi is not a local story but a case study in how fragile constitutional protections become when officials place ambition above duty.
From Kimmel being pulled off air, to women in Lucedale and Oxford receiving threats, to families grieving after senseless acts of political violence, the throughline is clear: When speech is chilled, due process is eliminated. When power is abused, our civil rights are not safe.
That is why I fight in the courtroom and in the public square to hold government accountable and to ensure that, even in moments of chaos, the rule of law remains.
If Mississippi’s auditor believes weaponizing his office against his own citizens is acceptable conduct, then he has disqualified himself from holding any public office going forward. Because in America, we do not audit dissent. We audit dollars.

Alves, the mayor of Danbury and Democratic state chair, announced Tuesday that he has a form of blood cancer.
 “After a series of recent medical tests, I have been diagnosed with Large B-Cell Lymphoma, a serious but treatable form of cancer,” Alves said in a statement. “I have begun treatment, and I am in good hands with my team of doctors.”
The diagnosis comes in the midst of Alves’ campaign for reelection to a second two-year term as mayor of Danbury, a racially diverse city of 88,000 on the state’s southwestern border with New York.
“My prognosis is strong, and I will continue to serve Danbury as Mayor, our state as Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party, and in all of my responsibilities, which I take very seriously,” he said in the statement. Those responsibilities include continuing his campaign, a spokeswoman said.
His statement did not disclose where or how he was being treated, nor did it state at what stage it was diagnosed. His spokeswoman later said said he will be treated with chemotherapy.
Alves, who could not be reached for comment, indicated in his statement a desire to strike a balance between transparency and privacy.
“While this is a deeply personal matter for my family and me, I believe it is important to be transparent with the community I serve,” Alves said. 
Alves, 42, is a Brazilian immigrant who came to the U.S. as a child and became a U.S. citizen in 2017. 
He won a council seat in 2019, then lost a race for the open mayoral seat in 2021, when the longtime Republican mayor, Mark Boughton, did not run. Alves won his rematch with Republican Dean Esposito in 2023.

Mike Braun proclaimed that he'll ""be that voice"" for Hoosier ratepayers angry about rising utility bills.","Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzie Jaworowski hold a news conference at the Statehouse on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Applications opened on Tuesday to join the powerful body that regulates Indiana’s utility companies — and sets their rates.
Gov. Mike Braun is seeking “entrepreneurial” candidates to fill three vacancies on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and take on rising customer bills.
“If you’re interested in protecting ratepayers, ensuring Indiana has a stable energy supply … and if you can bring objectivity and fairness to the table, we want to hear from you,” Braun said.

Interested candidates can apply here. Applications are due Oct. 14th.

“We will ensure that energy progress doesn’t come at the expense of Hoosier ratepayers’ ability to afford their energy bills,” he added, speaking during a Tuesday news conference.
Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett are leaving in October — months before their terms were set to end — and Chair Jim Huston’s term lapsed in April, but he will remain until a replacement is chosen.
Braun finalized a nominating committee, which will conduct interviews after the application period ends Oct. 14.
He named three appointees: Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzie Jaworowski; former state Rep. Dollyne Sherman; and Cory Cochran, an executive at commercial construction firm McRae Enterprises.
They join four appointees by the Indiana General Assembly:

Indiana Senate Republicans: Jim Merritt, president of JWM Consulting Corp. and a former state senator.
Indiana House Democrats: Grant Smith, a senior energy policy adviser at the Civil Society Institute.
Indiana House Republicans: Bill Champion, of corrugated pipe manufacturer Fratco.
Indiana Senate Democrats: Lindsay Shipps Haake, a government affairs specialist who has lobbied for utility customer advocates.

Asked if the nominating committee already has candidates in mind, Jaworowski said, “No, a lot of people have expressed interest, but we don’t know who will apply yet.”
The group will make recommendations, but final decisions are up to Braun.
Indiana is in the minority of states that gives the executive branch complete control over utility regulator selection.
In 13 states, they’re elected — mostly by voters, but also by lawmakers or political parties, according to research by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility customer advocacy group. 
In 33 states, regulators are appointed but must be confirmed by the legislative branch. Appointed regulators in Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada and New Hampshire aren’t.
Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. It is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website.
But Braun suggested it has leaned too far in one direction.
“Ratepayers, I think, have taken the brunt of it,” he told reporters — and called the affordability uproar “very analogous to what we went through on property taxes.”
Braun asserted that, just as taxpayers didn’t have high-powered lobbyists representing them in the property tax debate, “probably ratepayers don’t” when it comes to utilities.
“That’s where someone’s got to be a voice for it,” he said. “And I will be that voice.”
Braun also named a new leader for the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor this month. Counselor Abby Gray’s first public action was to recommend denial of one utility company’s proposed hike — and endorse reductions in its current rates.
“Utility companies … had legitimate cost increases,” Braun said. “But whenever you go beyond covering your costs and it looks like you’re trying to do more, then you’re taking advantage of a system that needs to be a little more attentive.”

(Courtesy of University of South Dakota)A University of South Dakota art professor facing the loss of his job over his online comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to stop the university and state Board of Regents from terminating his employment.
Michael Hook, a tenured art professor, is alleging his placement on administrative leave and impending termination are a violation of his constitutional right to free speech. Hook wrote social media posts on his personal account in reaction to the killing of Kirk, a prominent conservative political commentator who was fatally shot on Sept. 10 during a public event a Utah university.
Hook’s first post on Sept. 10 after the shooting included profanity and used a derogatory term to describe Kirk. Hook questioned the difference in coverage and “concern” between Kirk’s killing and the killing of a Minnesota legislator this summer and other school shootings.
He deleted the original and posted an apology “to those who were offended” three hours later.
South Dakota political leaders, including Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden and Republican House Speaker Jon Hansen, criticized Hook and publicly supported his termination.

Other educators around the country are also facing termination or discipline after sharing opinions on social media about the killing. An Iowa teacher, a South Carolina teacher aide and a Ball State employee filed lawsuits over their terminations following social media posts. A Sioux Falls School District staff member was terminated last year after she made a social media post about an assassination attempt on President Donald Trump.
Hook’s lawsuit says his impending termination and the South Dakota Board of Regents’ “overbroad regulation of speech” will have a chilling effect on free speech in the state for professors, students and citizens.
Hook and his attorney, Jim Leach, of Rapid City, filed the lawsuit in South Dakota federal court, calling the premise for the termination “vague, overbroad and unconstitutional.” The lawsuit seeks orders preventing retaliation against Hook, ending his administrative leave and canceling a Sept. 29 personal conference with him.
The lawsuit says Hook’s social media posts are protected political speech under the U.S. Constitution and do not impact his professional role at the university. 
“The debate about Mr. Kirk’s beliefs is for the marketplace of ideas,” the lawsuit says. “The First Amendment guarantees the marketplace stays open. The government may not punish people for their ideas.”
The Board of Regents filed an intent to fire Hook after the post circulated online. Spokeswoman Shuree Mortenson said the organization doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
The University of South Dakota notified Hook about his imminent termination on Sept. 12, based on the system’s termination policy regarding “neglect of duty, misconduct, incompetence, abuse of power or other actions that manifest an unfitness to discharge the trust reposed in public university faculty members or to perform assigned duties.” 
Under the policy, Hook is able to attend a personal conference “to discuss” his planned termination. Hook is placed on administrative leave until he is officially fired or another decision is made.
The employee code of conduct establishes that when faculty “speak or write as private citizens on matters of public concern” they are “free of institutional censorship or discipline.” At the same time, their “special position in the community imposes special obligations.”
“As learned people and as educators, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances,” the policy says. “Hence, they should at all times be accurate, show respect for the opinions of others and make every effort to indicate when they are not speaking for the institution.”

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Washington’s secretary of state on Tuesday denied the Trump administration’s request for personal information contained in the state’s voter rolls, saying to hand over the data would violate state and federal law.
Secretary Steve Hobbs told the Department of Justice he would be willing to provide voter names, addresses, genders, years of birth, voting records, registration dates and registration numbers. But he wouldn’t give dates of birth, driver license numbers and the last four digits of social security numbers. He wrote that information is protected under Washington law.
“As Washington state’s chief elections officer, I take my duty to protect voters and the sensitive information they entrust to the state very seriously,” Hobbs said in a statement. “While we will provide the DOJ with the voter registration data that state law already makes public, we will not compromise the privacy of Washington voters by turning over confidential information that both state and federal law prohibit us from disclosing.”
Hobbs’ position sets the stage for another legal clash between the state and the Trump administration.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Oregon and Maine for rejecting its demand for personal information contained in the states’ voter rolls.
The Justice Department requested the voter data from Washington two weeks ago amid its ongoing search for evidence to back up President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud caused by immigrants without legal status voting. Similar letters have gone to many states.
It’s one of several ways the Trump administration has pushed to get state data it otherwise wouldn’t receive. 
Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s civil rights division, cited compliance with the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act as the reason for the request for Washington’s confidential data. Specifically, Dhillon said she wanted to ensure the state was adequately updating its voter list. 
But Hobbs, a Democrat who oversees the state’s elections, worried “this is not the real reason for your request,” he wrote in his response Tuesday. 
Hobbs fears the information would be shared with the Department of Homeland Security to fuel the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. He notes that the information he is willing to give “should be more than sufficient to assess Washington’s list maintenance efforts.”
Hobbs is also concerned the collection could violate federal privacy law. He asked Dhillon, a former legal adviser to Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign, to explain how the request complies with such laws, and for clarification on how the data would be used.
“In addition to ensuring that Washington’s voter registration list complies with all applicable federal and state laws, my obligation also includes protecting Washington voters from unnecessary and illegitimate intrusions on their privacy,” Hobbs wrote.

Hobbs closed his letter with a link to where the Department of Justice can request Washington’s public voter registration list. Such data is often requested by news outlets and political parties.
Trump has also attacked the vote-by-mail election system Washington and other states have chosen. He has threatened via executive order to withhold federal funding to states that don’t comply with dramatic rule changes, like requiring documentation of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. The order signed in March also seeks to prevent states from counting ballots received after Election Day.

Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, to a six-month jail sentence with eligibility for work release, meaning she can work outside the jail during the day and sleep there at night.
A jury found Mitchell guilty of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools in July after she broke into her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home in April 2024.
Fritz ordered Mitchell to serve her six months sentence in Ramsey County jail. Defendants are typically incarcerated where the conviction occurred — in this case Becker County — but Fritz allowed her to serve her jail sentence in her home county so she can participate in work release. Minnesota requires convicted felons to serve two-thirds of their sentences incarcerated, so Mitchell will be in jail for at least four months.
Mitchell, who resigned from the Minnesota Senate shortly after her trial, was also sentenced to five years of probation.
The Woodbury Democrat was found guilty of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools in July after a five-day trial in Detroit Lakes. The prosecution successfully argued that Mitchell intended to steal her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her Detroit Lakes home on April 22, 2024. The state’s main evidence was that she told police as much during her arrest, and the jury saw the footage of her admissions from police officers’ body-worn cameras.
Mitchell testified during her trial, and on Tuesday during her sentencing hearing she told Fritz prior to her sentencing that she “deserved” to be there.
“I broke into her home. I was selfish. I was worried about my own feelings and a possible confrontation … and I did something ridiculous and illegal and selfish,” Mitchell said.
Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald read aloud a written statement from Carol Mitchell — Nicole Mitchell’s stepmother — during the sentencing hearing.
Carol Mitchell said she still does not feel safe after the break-in and can never trust her stepdaughter again.
“The fear that Nicole created when she broke into my house has not left me,” Carol Mitchell wrote.

Laura Kelly opposes mid-decade congressional redistricting, but seeks public hearings if GOP legislators insist on special session to remap boundaries.","Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly rejects Republicans' call for mid-decade congressional redistricting in Kansas during a special session of the Legislature. She said if the GOP proceeds with that strategy, the public should be able to share their views at a series of town hall meetings. In this image, Kelly speaks in January 2025 at the Capitol. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly on Tuesday recommended the Kansas Legislature gather public testimony about Republican plans to redraw the state’s four congressional districts to disadvantage Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids in the next election.
“I am calling on legislative leadership to host town halls prior to circulating a petition for a special session,” Kelly said in a statement. “Kansans must be offered the opportunity to express their opinions directly to their representatives, as they have during previous redistricting processes.”
The Republican-led Legislature convened 18 public sessions in 2021 in advance of the House and Senate votes in 2022 to reconfigure U.S. House district boundaries. That congressional map was expected to be in place for a decade, but President Donald Trump applied pressure on Kansas and other states to perform mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to swell the ranks of GOP members in the U.S. House after the 2026 election cycle.
Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, both Wichita-area Republicans seeking election to statewide offices, have contemplated convening a special session in November to work on maps that would split moderate voters of Johnson County among multiple congressional districts.
The political objective would be to make the 3rd District, which is represented by Davids and anchored by Johnson and Wyandotte counties, more winnable for Republican candidates. At the same time, the districts of GOP U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt and Ron Estes would lose a portion of their Republican edge in terms of registered voters.
Kelly said she wouldn’t call a special session for the purpose of redistricting. Masterson and Hawkins have the option of gathering petition signatures from two-thirds of Senate and House members to compel a special session of the Legislature. Currently, Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers and numerically could reach that threshold.
The Democratic governor said discussions about a special session and congressional redistricting “must be brought out from behind closed doors and into the public domain.”
In 2021, then-House Speaker Ron Ryckman said redistricting in Kansas should be viewed as a multi-year process that included town halls to gauge what Kansas wanted to see in terms of adjustments to district boundaries. The Olathe Republican insisted at that time the process should allow for “additional public input” beyond views of legislators.
In 2022, Masterson said it was important to keep a united Johnson County at the core of the 3rd District held by Davids.
In wake of Trump’s call on Kansas to shift its congressional boundaries, Masterson said his consideration of redistricting wouldn’t be connected to his quest to secure Trump’s endorsement in the upcoming governor’s race. While Masterson is among GOP candidates for governor, Hawkins is running for state insurance commissioner.
Kelly said Kansas lawmakers ought to adhere to precedent and offer robust in-person and online public comment options.
She said residents of Johnson County should have a voice in planning an unprecedented mid-decade redistricting of U.S. House boundaries, especially when that action could be taken without referencing new Census data needed to divide the population into four districts.
“I do not agree with mid-decade redistricting based on old data and a clearly partisan agenda,” Kelly said in a statement.
Hawkins, the House speaker, said he was puzzled Kelly opposed redistricting in Kansas but encouraged redistricting in Democrat-led states such as California in response to action by Republican-controlled states such as Texas. Kelly chairs the Democratic Governors Association.
“Governor Laura Kelly made it clear at the Democratic Governors Association that Democrats should pursue redistricting across the country,” Hawkins said. “To quote the governor, ‘there is a bigger risk in doing nothing.’ It is certainly an issue we are considering seriously.”
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, both Democrats from Johnson County, echoed Kelly’s opposition to a special session and support for hearings on redistricting.
“This push for redistricting is a blatant attempt to curry favor with Trump and boost GOP political ambitions, not to serve Kansans,” Woodard said. “If Republican leadership wants a costly special session, they should have the courage to discuss it with the public first. Kansas Democratic leadership is prepared to assist in organizing these meetings to ensure transparency throughout the discussions.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1142484-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-23 14:58:35.500683

With federal funding drying up for hospitals and higher education institutions, the administration argues the state must step in to maintain its competitive edge.","GOV. MAURA HEALY has been applying a full-court press to pass a $400 million bill aimed at strengthening Massachusetts’ research and innovation economy, but lawmakers have left the governor’s plans for a “transformative investment” idling in the seven weeks since Healey proposed it.
Healey’s Discovery, Research and Innovation for a Vibrant Economy (DRIVE) bill aims to attract private investment and preserve research jobs. With federal funding drying up for hospitals and higher education institutions, the administration argues the state must step in to maintain its competitive edge.
After filing the legislation (H 4375) on July 31, just as lawmakers were departing Beacon Hill for a weeks-long summer recess, Healey held a press conference at UMass Memorial Health in Worcester this month about the “incredibly important piece of legislation.” Last week, she convened the first meeting of her high-powered DRIVE Acceleration Team task force led by the state Federal Funds and Infrastructure Director Quentin Palfrey. 
Asked in Worcester about when she wants the legislation back to her desk, Healey said, “As soon as possible. I mean, we need this to happen. We need this to happen now.”
“This is a top priority for me,” Healey told reporters at the State House last week after a meeting of the task force, whose members constitute a collective who’s who of top business, health care and higher education officials including former Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.
While Healey has been publicly promoting her plan, the bill has not been scheduled for its legislative debut: a public hearing before the Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies.
“It is a bill that will be scheduled, I do not have a date yet,” said Rep. Carole Fiola, the House chair of the committee. Fiola noted the bill arrived in August, adding, “We have a schedule of bills right now.”
Fiola said the administration reached out to her in mid-September, and they’re planning to meet in the coming weeks to discuss the proposal. She emphasized that bills already scheduled for hearings will take precedence.
“I guess there’s been quite a bit of publicity trying to be generated about it, but I think we’re going to follow the process that we do as a Legislature,” she said.
Healey says the DRIVE bill is critically important at a time when the Trump administration is defunding medical research — vital for both health care and the state’s economy.
“This isn’t just about filling gaps left by what has been devastating cuts at the federal level. This is actually about designing something that will continue to be a catalytic engine for our state,” Healey said at the press conference in Worcester. “The federal administration is not helping us right now, because they don’t understand the value of science, the value of research, because they’ve continued to defund medical research right now and do other things that undermine public health, in my view. But in Massachusetts, we’re going to move forward.”
Healey created the task force with an Aug. 1 executive order and during their first meeting she urged the group to “move this forward and get this both passed, and also, importantly, implemented, operationalized, as quickly as possible. Time is of the essence.”
Sen. Barry Finegold, the other chair of the committee who controls the fate of the DRIVE bill, seemed to share some of the governor’s urgency.
“We are very much looking forward to the hearing coming up and learning more about the bill, with everything happening on the federal level we need to be on the offensive as a state,” he said in a statement to the News Service.
Fiola said she understands research and life sciences are big economic engines for the state, and needs to learn more about the bill.
“Let’s take a breath and understand just what the numbers are. Where is the need? What is the best way to approach it? That is how we deliberatively work as a body,” she said. “There are a lot of important pressing needs: energy costs, all these federal implications of federal cutbacks. So we’re looking at all of it.”
The committee is holding a hearing on about a dozen bills Thursday, but Healey’s bill is not on the agenda.
Reps. Jeff Roy and Ann-Margaret Ferrante were present at last week’s DRIVE Initiative meeting. Healey acknowledged Finegold’s absence but noted his support. She did not mention Fiola in her opening remarks.
Brooke Thomson, president and CEO of Associated Industries of Massachusetts and a member of the DRIVE Initiative, said the bill is drawing attention from the business community.
“I was over at Biogen yesterday, they had a groundbreaking of their new headquarters,” she said. “By showing movement on this bill… we’re sending a message.”
Thomson added, “With researchers deciding if they’re going to stay here, if they see states like Massachusetts are committing their resources, they might say, ‘I’m not going to take that postdoc in another state, or from someone trying to poach me in Europe. Yes, I’ve lost my fellowship or grant, but I can see Massachusetts is demonstrating they’re trying to keep me. So I’ll stay.'”
AIM sent a letter on September 8 to Senate President Karen Spilka, House Speaker Ron Mariano, Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz urging passage of the bill.
The letter, signed by Thomson, highlighted the broader economic impact: “Every dollar invested in research yields more than twice that amount in economic benefits. Moreover, the impact of research funding extends well beyond labs and universities — two out of every five jobs supported are in other sectors such as construction, food services, health care, retail, and administrative support.”
While DRIVE remains on the sidelines, Beacon Hill has a history of tackling major issues through omnibus bills. Lawmakers are expected to roll out a comprehensive jobs or economic development package later this session, likely in the coming months as election season approaches. It’s possible Democrats are eyeing DRIVE as a component of that broader effort — though for now, it remains only one idea among many on the table.
The Legislature this month held its first formal sessions since July and lawmakers have about eight weeks to hold additional formal sessions before their traditional six-week holiday recess begins around November 19.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Healey-State-of-the-Commonwealth-2025-SHNS-edited.jpg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 13:57:18.632327

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet joined with members of the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council and Protect Our Care Michigan on Tuesday, with the Bay City Democrat asking her peers in Congress to extend tax credits helping thousands of Michiganders pay for health insurance. 
While Congressional Republicans renewed several provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress has not taken steps to renew the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, which were established through the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and expanded by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. 
According to KFF, these credits save Michiganders an average of $449 a month.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Health care premiums are expected to rise substantially if the credits are allowed to expire at the end of 2025, with the Citizens Research Council warning premiums would increase by 70% in Michigan. 
“Costs are already way too high, and tariffs are only making things worse. Families and seniors in my district can’t afford an extra $730 for their insurance premiums,” said McDonald Rivet, whose district covers Saginaw and Bay counties, most of Genesee County and parts of Tuscola and Midland counties.
According to the council, these premium tax credits effectively create a cap on the price of health insurance plans for individuals. Since the introduction of the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, nationwide coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace has doubled.
The Big Beautiful Bill Act also cut funds from several programs, including $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which is expected to strip care away from hundreds of thousands of Michigan residents, carrying negative impacts for hospitals, particularly those in rural areas. 
“The impact of people not buying private insurance through the Marketplace will likely have cascading effects across the state, much in the same way that the Medicaid cuts are expected to,” Robert Schneider, a senior research associate for the council said in a statement. “More uninsured people means health care costs will go up for everyone in the form of higher health insurance premiums, while hospitals will see more uncompensated care, leading to reduced services and even closure. Combined with cuts to Medicaid, health care in our state faces a downward spiral that will put people’s health, safety and well-being at risk.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-4-1024x619.png,,,2025-09-23 13:57:18.632327

 The rising cost of home insurance across New Mexico is causing some recipients of subsidized mortgages to fall behind on their loans, according to officials from the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority.
The authority, also known as Housing New Mexico, offers mortgage loans at reduced interest rates for low-income, first-time homebuyers, along with down-payment assistance and other subsidies. But the authority lacks control over some costs, MFA Director Isidoro “Izzy “Hernandez said during a “State of Housing” presentation at a recent housing summit  in Albuquerque. 
“We’re starting to see in the portfolio of the loans that we service a little bit higher delinquency rates,” he said. “And I think some of that is due to the insurance payments and the escrow payments…that would be increased in general.”
Kristie Garcia, a spokesperson for the authority, told Source New Mexico via email on Monday afternoon that the authority lacks “solid data” showing that rising homeowners insurance cost is increasing loan defaults, but the authority has asked its loan servicer to help quantify the situation.
“This theory is based on conversations Housing New Mexico employees have had with representatives from our loan servicer,” she said. “We have asked them to start gathering data on insurance premium increases in an effort to better understand the correlation and impact on delinquencies.”
Fires making home insurance unaffordable, impossible, NM lawmakers say

The authority’s 12.46% delinquency rate marks an increase from 11.3% this time last year, Garcia said. 
Rising construction costs and increasingly costly natural disasters across the country factor into statewide insurance premium hikes, state officials have said. 
Premiums increased across the state 16% between 2020 and 2023, according to the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, making the average annual premium $1,817. Some New Mexico counties saw much-higher increases, namely Hidalgo, Roosevelt and Curry counties, where premiums increased between 40% and 47% in that period, according to the office. 
In response to the rising insurance costs, the authority has started allowing its mortgage recipients to opt in to high-deductible plans, which results in lower premiums. But that has drawbacks for homeowners if they ever need insurance to pay for the cost of damage from a natural disaster or other hazards, said Jeff Payne, Housing New Mexico’s chief loan officer, said at the presentation last week.
“Those higher deductibles are harder to meet when they do need to use their insurance,” Payne said of the high-deductible plan holders with subsidized mortgages. “It’s a real problem.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Carol-Sugarman.jpg,,,2025-09-23 13:57:18.632327

(Photo courtesy of PAcast)Nearly one week after three York County police officers were killed and two were injured after a gunman ambushed them, state Attorney General Dave Sunday is warning about potential scams involving fundraising efforts.
“Pennsylvanians are caring and generous people always willing to help in the wake of tragedy,” Sunday said. “With so many people seeking ways to help those affected by the horrifying shooting last week in York County, it is important to ensure those charitable donations reach those who need them.”
On Wednesday, Detective Sergeant Cody Becker, Detective Mark Baker and Detective Isaiah Emenheiser were shot and killed by Matthew J. Ruth while serving a warrant in North Codorus Township.
Sunday said his office and its Bureau of Consumer Protection is attempting to stay on top  of trending scams that may occur, in order to help the public avoid any problems. The AG noted that scammers tend to look at current events to develop ways to defraud people.
He’s encouraging potential donors to visit the Northern York County Regional Police Department’s Facebook page and the York County, PA’s Sheriff’s Office’s Facebook page for more information on how to make donations.
During a Thursday press conference that provided further details about the shooting, the department-endorsed fundraiser for the families of the killed and injured officers was highlighted.
Sunday also said those looking to donate could also determine the legitimacy of other fundraising efforts by researching whether the affected agencies, involved police officers and whether deputy associations, or Fraternal Order of Police lodges support or endorse a particular effort.
Those who feel they were targeted or fell victim to a scam can file a complaint with the Office of Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Protection at www.attorneygeneral.gov or by calling 717-787-3391.
According to the Associated Press, the three slain officers had almost six decades of combined service. The shooting in North Codorus Township is one of the deadliest incidents for Pennsylvania police officers in almost two decades.

(Phto by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A Florida pharmacy licensing board on Tuesday made clear that prescriptions aren’t necessary for  patients who want to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
During a brief meeting that included no public testimony, members of the Florida Board of Pharmacy discussed and affirmed a rule that allows pharmacists who have written protocol agreements with physicians to administer COVID-19 vaccines. That means patients don’t need to get a prescription from their physician before heading to the pharmacy to get the jab.
“I think the board’s interpretation has been very clear. And I’ll just sum it up with a bow; I think at the end of the day this, and all current COVID vaccines will fall — once they are FDA approved — will fall into the group that is allowed to be administered by a protocol physician and a pharmacist here in the state of Florida,” Board of Pharmacy chair and Tallahassee pharmacist Dr. Jonathan Hickman said. “So with that, I will entertain a motion to adjourn the meeting.”
The meeting lasted for fewer than 15 minutes and came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted last week against requiring prescriptions for COVID-19 vaccinations.
The advisory panel did, however, vote to change long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults and to place a new emphasis on the risks of COVID-19 immunizations, despite agency’s own data demonstrating that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people.
The move by ACIP to require prescriptions was criticized by Dr. Amy Middleman, who serves as an ACIP liaison member on behalf of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.
“If we start asking for prescriptions for vaccines, which are, again, a primary prevention public health strategy, we are going to overwhelm physicians’ offices. It’s alarming to me that for a primary preventive strategy, we are actually adding access concerns and barriers, rather than diminishing them.”
The number of people getting vaccinated for COVID-19 continues to drop. Nearly 15.4 million people in Florida were vaccinated for COVID-19 in 2021 after the shot first became available. That number dwindled to 5,492,147 in 2022; 2,015,085 in 2023; and to 1,634,826 in 2024. As of Sept. 23, 341,363 people in Florida have been vaccinated for COVID-19, state Department of Health data show.
The Ladapo show
The Florida Board of Pharmacy is housed in the DOH, administered by state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. He and his boss, Gov. Ron DeSantis, made national headlines last month when they said that all vaccine mandates should be eliminated from Florida’s statutes as well as all its rules and regulations.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Ladapo has deep skepticisms about the safety of messenger RNA, or mRNA, which is a molecule that acts as a temporary copy of a gene’s DNA sequence. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA.
In 2022, Ladapo warned of an “abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death” for young men who took the COVID-19 vaccine. The report was criticized by public health experts and Politico later reported Ladapo falsified the findings of the study.
In 2023 Ladapo advised people under age 65 to not get vaccinated for COVID-19.
In January 2024 Ladapo called on the federal government to halt the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
But it’s not just COVID-19 vaccines the state surgeon general has qualms with.
Ladapo last year advised parents that it was up to them to decide whether to keep their children at home amid a measles outbreak in Broward County — counter to usual practice and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of urging parents to keep unvaccinated children at home.

What do medical experts say?,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-and-rfk-jr-are-making-claims-about-autism-what-do-medical-experts-say,,"WASHINGTON — Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stirred up major concerns and considerable speculation earlier this year when he announced the administration would release a report revealing the causes of autism by the end of September. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with no medical degree, stood next to President Donald Trump on Sept. 22 as they presented the over-the-counter drug Tylenol as one potential driving factor behind autism diagnoses and pointed to folate, a B vitamin, as a possible treatment — both conclusions the medical community hasn’t yet reached. Kennedy throughout his tenure has also made overly broad and disparaging statements about people who have an autism diagnosis, often referring to traits exhibited in people with the most severe cases. For example, he claimed in April that children with autism would never function as independent adults, drawing intense criticism for making a generalization that would not apply to every person with a diagnosis.The Trump-Kennedy announcement and Kennedy’s characterizations have raised questions about why someone would be diagnosed, what types of research have been done and what reputable science has found about causes. States Newsroom spoke with three experts before the announcement to gain a better understanding of autism spectrum disorder. Below are brief excerpts from those interviews. What is autism spectrum disorder? The two core characteristics of autism are challenges with social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behavior, according to Autism Science Foundation Chief Science Officer Dr. Alycia Halladay. As understanding of the diagnosis has evolved, she explained, researchers and families have increasingly referred to it as autisms, plural, instead of autism, singular, in part, because there are so many different subtypes.“It makes it more accurate when describing it — that autism is not just one entity of core autism features, that there is so much diversity across the spectrum, that it's actually a group of developmental disorders,” Halladay said. The spectrum, she said, ranges from people who may speak rarely to those who are fluent in language, people with cognitive disabilities to those with IQs of more than 120 and people who can live independently to those who need round-the-clock care.Dr. Michael Murray, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at the Penn State College of Medicine, described it as “a neurodevelopmental disorder, meaning that people are born with it and it's lifelong and it can cause a variety of challenges for people.”“The most common and significant and probably pervasive symptom across the spectrum is challenges in understanding and interpreting what we call neurotypical — meaning everyone who is non-autistic — social behavior,” Murray said. “So just understanding all the non-verbal parts of social communication, understanding nuance and non-literal use of language. All those things can be really difficult for autistic people.”Approximately 1 in 31 children in the United States and 1 in 45 adults fall somewhere along the autism spectrum, according to the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. How is autism diagnosed?Only an expert can diagnose an autism spectrum disorder using criteria in a guide used by health care professionals called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM. “You need someone who knows autism, who knows what to look for, who knows how to elicit behaviors or not elicit behaviors that are indicative of an autism diagnosis,” Halladay said. “So it's really diagnosed by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or somebody else who's trained to understand what autism is and what it's not.”Murray said there are three social communication behaviors that doctors or other qualified medical professionals look for when considering whether to diagnose someone with autism. “It is difficulty in interpreting social information. It is difficulty giving social information through things like facial expression and tone of voice. And thirdly, is a difficulty maintaining appropriate peer relationships,” Murray said. “Now, once again, this is from a neurotypical description of peer relationships. There's a lot of talk among neurodivergent individuals about whether that's fair, that we rate social relationships based on how we think they should be. But nonetheless, that's the criteria.”Murray explained experts also observe the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviors in assessing whether someone has autism. “And that captures things that are in the realm of interacting with the physical world around you,” Murray said. “So that need for sameness and inflexibility maintaining routines.”Carissa Cascio, a senior scientist at the University of Kansas Life Span Institute and Kansas Center for Autism Research and Training, reinforced that autism is “strictly diagnosed based on behavior.”“There are genes that have an association with autism that you can test for. There's some genes that have a very strong association, and you can do a test for the presence of one of those genes,” Cascio said. “But for the diagnosis of autism itself, it's strictly based on behavior.”What do we know about the causes of autism?While more scientific research is needed, a combination of genetics and environmental factors is responsible for the formation of autism spectrum disorders. “We know that one of the largest causes of autism is genetics. We know this because it runs in families,” Halladay said, adding there “are over 150 known genes associated with autism.”“If there's a variation in the gene, there's a high likelihood of having an autism diagnosis,” she said. “And those genes are genes that tell cells in the brain where to go and how to connect, which seems to be a core biological feature of autism.”Halladay emphasized that research has established the “most important part is the interaction between genetics and the environment.”“Neither the gene nor the environmental factor is strong enough, but together, they increase the probability of having a child with autism,” Halladay explained. During the last 25 years, as Murray has advanced in his career, the medical community’s thinking about and understanding of autism spectrum disorders has “significantly increased.”“We know right now that 80 to 90% of autism is accounted for by genetic differences .... It's not just you got exposed to this thing in the environment, now you have autism. You have to have the genetic susceptibility first and then the environment might make it more likely, or maybe influence the expression of it,” Murray said.Cascio said that when it comes to environmental factors, studies have shown pregnancy or the very early post-natal time frame are key. “We're still parsing this out, but some of the environmental factors that seem to have more evidence behind them than others are older parental age, perinatal trauma, premature birth and low birth weight,” Cascio said. “And then there's some maternal health factors that are gathering some evidence as well. So maternal infection and immune response, maternal exposure to medications or pollutants are sort of gathering some evidence.” While much more research is needed on the many potential environmental factors, Cascio said scientists know vaccines are not a component. “The things that we definitely can rule out are things that have been studied in great depth and not really produced much association. So you know, the idea that vaccines cause autism is a common belief. There have been dozens and dozens of studies that have all failed to find any association between vaccines and autism,” Cascio said.There’s also not yet a clear link with Tylenol, also called acetaminophen, as a possible environmental factor. “It is unlikely that this is the smoking gun that they're hoping for,” Cascio said. “I think we all want to understand this better, but this is certainly not something that we feel has a strong weight of evidence behind it yet.”A spokesperson for Kenvue, the company that manufactures Tylenol, wrote in a statement released in connection with the Trump-Kennedy press conference that “acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.  “Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives. High fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated.”Why have autism diagnoses increased over several decades? Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy has repeatedly raised concerns with an increase in autism diagnoses over several decades, but experts say there are logical reasons for this. “In the early 1990s the CDC set up a system to collect and count the number of people with autism,” Halladay said. “So it definitely has increased since then, but one of the main reasons that's been shown over and over again is access to services.”Halladay believes most of the increase is due to greater knowledge and access, though she said, “there is room for some of the increase in autism to be a true increase in the number of people with autism due to something else.”Murray explained that about 60% to 70% of people diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum are characterized as having “low-support needs, meaning that they clearly have the features of autism, but they are able to, with the appropriate level of supports, be in traditional schools or typical schools; they can, with job support, work and lead their lives the way they choose to.”When Murray began his career, he said, those people never would have been diagnosed as having autism.  “Secondly, we as a professional community are getting better and better at picking up these symptoms, particularly in kids who are quite young,” Murray said.During the late 1980s and 1990s, Cascio said, a new version of the DSM and better tools helped medical professionals more accurately diagnose people along the entire autism spectrum. Additionally, Cascio said, there’s a similar concept called diagnostic substitution, where people who in the past may have been diagnosed with something else are now being correctly diagnosed with autism. How much research has been done on autism and over how many years?Scientists have been researching autism for decades, building on past work to better understand how to diagnose and assist people across the spectrum, though experts said more is needed.“The many, many scientific discoveries and funding into understanding autism has promoted scientists moving into the field,” Halladay said. “So there's clearly an increased number over the past two decades of the number of people who are focused on studying autism.”Murray said the first papers published in scientific journals regarding autism were in 1944. “So it is 80 years, at a minimum, of work,” Murray said.Murray reiterated that autism spectrum disorders are not simple to study and said a “really important paper came out earlier this year talking about how there's four genetically recognizable subtypes of autism. So it's not a single autism. It is, at the very least, four autisms, and probably more.”Cascio said addressing any aspect of autism is complicated.“The behavior is complex. The genetics are complex. The brain is complex,"" Cascio said. “And so this makes it a huge challenge for research. And there's certainly no possibility that we would go from not fully understanding the causes of autism to having a definitive cause in five months.”What are some of the biggest misconceptions about autism? The internet has led to misinformation, and in many cases disinformation, and health diagnoses are no exception.  Halladay said people often try to simplify autism or believe an actor’s portrayal in a television show or movie is representative of everyone on the spectrum. “I think that because of the narrative of autism being oversimplified, that people are not understanding that it's a more complex disorder,” she said. Murray said the autism spectrum may be pictured as a straight line and an expectation arises when someone is diagnosed that they are in just one spot. “That's not really the way it is. There are needs or strengths that show up variably depending on the demands of the situation,” Murray said. “So for instance, someone who has a really exquisite sensitivity to sound, if they are attending a symphony, that may make that experience so much more rich for him or her versus the average person. “But if they are at a rock concert, it may be overwhelming. The same trait can be a source of vulnerability or a strength depending on the situation.”Murray said there’s often a misconception that all people with autism are antisocial or don’t want to make and maintain friendships.  “And that's true for some people, right? They aren't really interested in social interactions. It's not their thing,” Murray said. “It's also true for some neurotypical people that they're really not interested in social interactions. But the vast, vast majority of autistic individuals just want a friend, and they want someone who they can count on and rely on. They want to be loved, just like everyone else in the world ... They just need more supports or different situations to have that happen.”Cascio said that people can form misconceptions after seeing actors portray people along the spectrum.“I first became interested in autism after watching the movie ‘Rain Man,’” Cascio said. “And I think there's a lot of people who see a depiction like that and think, 'Okay, this is what autism looks like.' And there's just so much more complexity and variability from person to person and I would say that's probably the biggest misconception.”Cascio said it’s also human nature to want one clear answer to why someone develops autism or any other health diagnosis, but that oftentimes the best science shows a more complicated picture. “It's uncomfortable for us to say, ‘This is really complex and we don't understand it yet,’” she said. “And so when there is something that people hold up and say, ‘Here's an explanation.’ I think it can be really tempting for people to just want to have it solved. And that's a very natural reaction.”",,,,2025-09-23 12:57:32.902628

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)MINOT, N.D. – North Dakota’s State Board of Higher Education voted Tuesday to make interim Chancellor Brent Sanford the long-term leader of the state’s University System. 
Board member Tim Mihalick said Sanford has the “it factor” that rarely comes along in a leader. The board chose not to do a national search. 
Board member Danita Bye said a national search would have led the board back to Sanford, echoing previous statements from Board Chair Kevin Black. 
Sanford’s title will change from chancellor to commissioner. The motion approving Sanford also changed the title to align with what is in the state constitution. 
Student board member Max Eriksrud said he felt the title change did not change the University System leader’s role, adding that students he has talked to have been impressed by Sanford.  
Sanford likens top North Dakota higher ed job to his experience in governor’s office

Sanford pointed to his time as North Dakota’s lieutenant governor, where one of his duties was chairing the North Dakota Higher Education Challenge Grant Fund that awards state dollars to match private fundraising at the 11 public colleges and universities in the state. 
“I knew your budgets before I knew you,” Sanford, a certified public accountant, told the State Board of Higher Education and campus representatives during a meeting at Minot State University. 
Sanford was asked by Black to give a presentation on his vision for the North Dakota University System and take questions from the board.
One question was about what some perceive as Sanford’s lack of academic credentials. He holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of North Dakota but doesn’t hold an advanced degree. 
That’s when Sanford referenced his six years of Challenge Grant experience under Gov. Doug Burgum. 
Sanford admitted he has limited experience in academia. He served briefly as the interim president of Bismarck State College before being named interim chancellor in April. 
He said being chancellor has been “a better fit than I thought it would be.” 
He described chancellor as being an administrator job. 
“It’s not like running a campus,” he said. 
Sanford’s compensation was not immediately finalized. Sanford is being paid $425,000 a year to be interim chancellor.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The University of Florida remains the seventh best public university in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report’s 2026 rankings. 
Those rankings feature Florida State University at No. 21 and the University of South Florida at #43, each rising two spots since last year’s rankings. 
“UF’s standing reflects a decade of concerted effort, supported by historic state investment and federal research funding, leading to stronger student outcomes, inspired research accomplishments and ever-greater impact on the economy of Florida,” UF Interim President Donald Landry said in a news release.
The Gainesville university, No. 30 among all public and private universities, has been without a permanent leader since Ben Sasse resigned in July 2024. Since, various leadership positions have been filled on an interim basis. Landry took the helm this month as interim president as the university begins a new search after former University of Michigan President Santa Ono was rejected as UF’s president by the Board of Governors.
UF shares the No. 7 spot with University of Texas-Austin.
Florida International University, the best performing university by Florida metrics, was inside the top 50 public institutions at No. 46. 
“FIU is on a clear path to becoming a Top 30 public university by 2030,” FIU President Jeanette Nuñez said in a news release. “We continue to lead in academics, research, student success, and upward economic mobility.”  
Among various rankings throughout the year, U.S. News & World Report are perhaps the most widely cited. 
Most of the scoring is based on graduation rates and student outcomes. Also, 20% is determined by peer assessment, 11% by faculty resources, and the rest by financial resources, student excellence, and faculty research. 
“This year’s rankings reflect the unwavering commitment of Florida’s public universities to delivering academic excellence and world-class faculty expertise,” Board of Governors Chair Brian Lamb said in a news release. “These remarkable outcomes affirm the hard work and dedication of our university trustees, faculty, students, and staff across the state.”
The schools ahead of UF are the University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Los Angeles; University of Michigan-Ann Arbor; University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill; University of Virginia; and University of California, San Diego.
The top 14 schools in the nation are private, according to U.S. News & World Report.

For the seventh consecutive year, Florida A&M University was the No. 1 public historically Black college or university in the nation and No. 5 among all HBCUs.
Separate from the top public category, New College of Florida was ranked No. 135 among 207 National Liberal Arts Colleges, tying with the private Eckerd College in St. Petersburg.
The University of West Florida was ranked the No. 6 best public school in the South region and No. 14 among public and private universities in the South. It ranked below other Florida institutions Rollins College, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Stetson University, Florida Southern College, and the University of Tampa. 
In other university news, UCF achieved preeminence status this week, its president announced. That status is designated by the state, achieved by reaching metrics such as graduation rate, research expenditures, patents, endowment size, and doctoral degrees awarded and provides additional funding to schools that meet them. Other preeminent schools include UF, FSU, USF, and FIU.
In a ranking of campus free speech by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression earlier this month, FSU was rated the best in the state in that category.

Ann Bauer, a researcher who studies Tylenol and autism, felt queasy with anxiety in the weeks leading up to the White House’s much-anticipated autism announcement.
In August, Bauer and her colleagues published an analysis of 46 previous studies on Tylenol, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many found no link between the drug and the conditions, while some suggested Tylenol might occasionally exacerbate other potential causes of autism, such as genetics.
Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and her team called for more judicious use of the drug until the science is settled.
On Monday, President Donald Trump stood beside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a “historic” announcement on autism.
“If you’re pregnant, don’t take Tylenol, and don’t give it to the baby after the baby is born,” Trump said. “There are certain groups of people that don’t take vaccines and don’t take any pills that have no autism,” he added, without providing evidence. “They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace.”
A fact sheet released alongside the White House briefing cited Bauer’s analysis. But she was alarmed by Trump’s comments. If prenatal Tylenol has any association, which it may not, it would help account for only a fraction of cases, she said. Further, research has not deeply examined Tylenol risks in young children, and many rigorous studies refute a link between vaccines and autism.
Bauer worries such statements will cut both ways: People may put themselves at risk to avoid vaccines and Tylenol, the only safe painkiller for use during pregnancy. And she frets that scientists might outright reject her team’s measured concerns about Tylenol in a backlash against misleading remarks from Trump and other members of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement.
“I’m really concerned about how this message is going to play out,” she said. “It’s a sound-bite universe, and everyone wants a simple solution.”
Autism experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were neither consulted for the White House’s long-awaited autism announcement nor asked to review a draft of the findings and recommendations, CDC scientists told KFF Health News, which agreed not to identify them because they fear retaliation.
“Typically, we’d be asked to provide information and review the report for accuracy, but we’ve had absolutely no contact with anyone,” one CDC researcher said. “It is very unusual.”
Trump and Kennedy promised this year that under their leadership the federal government would swiftly figure out what causes autism. Scientists who work in the field have been skeptical, noting that decades of research has shown that no single drug, chemical, or other environmental factor is strongly linked to the developmental disorder. In addition, both Trump and Kennedy have repeated the scientifically debunked notion that childhood vaccines may cause autism.
Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University, called Trump’s comments dangerous. Fevers can harm the mother and the developing fetus, she said, adding that fevers are more strongly associated with autism than Tylenol.
In an emailed response to queries, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America’s unprecedented rise in autism rates.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote, “President Trump pledged to address America’s rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science.”
Had CDC scientists been allowed to brief Kennedy, they say they would have cautioned that simple fixes won’t make a dent in the number of autism cases in the United States: As many as 1-in-31 8-year-old children had autism spectrum disorder in 2022.
Systemic changes, such as regulations on air pollution, which has been linked to asthma and developmental disabilities including autism, and assistance for parents of disabled children, could improve lives for far more Americans with autism and other conditions than actions taken by the Trump administration on Sept. 22, researchers say.
One federal action is to consider updating the label on Tylenol and to “encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.” The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends acetaminophen “as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”
 ‘Political Crusade’ 

Despite Kennedy’s many years of speaking about autism, he rarely cites credible autism research or expert recommendations, Tager-Flusberg said. Instead, Kennedy repeats fringe, scientifically debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, despite rigorous studies published in peer-reviewed journals that refute a link.
At the Sept. 22 briefing, Trump said he spoke with Kennedy about autism 20 years ago: “We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it,” he said.
Ahead of Trump’s first term in 2017, Kennedy said he met with the president to consider a commission on vaccine safety and autism. It didn’t happen then. But soon after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary, he called autism “preventable,” pointed to “environmental toxins,” and contradicted the results of a CDC study finding that the main driver of rising autism diagnoses was that doctors increasingly recognize the disorder.
At a televised Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump, “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.”
“You stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it’s a shot,” Trump replied.
“He is on a political crusade,” Tager-Flusberg said of Kennedy, adding that vaccines, Tylenol, aluminum, and food dyes make for simple targets to rally against. “We know genetics is the most significant risk factor,” she said, “but you can’t blame Big Pharma for genetics, and you can’t build a political movement on genetics research and ride to victory.”
“RFK makes our work harder,” said Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the author of a book about his autistic daughter, “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism.” He said the book stemmed from conversations with Kennedy in 2017, in which Hotez shared studies pinpointing more than a hundred genes linked to autism, and research into the complex interplay between genetics, biological processes, and things that children and fetuses encounter during development.
“I sat down with him and explained what the science says, but he was unwilling or incapable of thinking deeply about it,” Hotez said. “He is extremely careless.”
In addition to its focus on Tylenol, the White House said it would move to update “prescribing information” on leucovorin — a medication related to the B vitamin folate — to reflect its use as an autism treatment. A small clinical trial in 2012-13 suggested the drug may help treat language problems in some children with autism. Tager-Flusberg said the findings warrant further study but clarified these were “old data, not a breakthrough.”
Likewise, studies finding a modest association between autism and prolonged Tylenol use were published years ago. Researchers have suggested the medicine might occasionally exacerbate factors associated with autism, such as genetics and oxidative stress, a biological condition that occurs for a variety of reasons that scientists are still unraveling.
Still, these studies couldn’t rule out the possibility that fevers prompting women to take Tylenol, rather than the medicine itself, might instead be to blame. Fevers and infections — including those prevented by vaccines — have also been linked to autism.
Nonetheless, Bauer’s recommendation would be to pause before taking acetaminophen while pregnant — blanket advice that doctors give for all medications during that period, but which may be ignored.
“Try to alleviate discomfort in some other ways, like with a cold compress, hydration, or massage, before taking it,” Bauer said.
She welcomed the White House’s motion to consider labeling Tylenol to emphasize judicious use of the drug but worries about how the MAHA movement might distort a careful message. On Sept. 2, the right-wing news outlet One America News Network posted an interview with newly appointed CDC vaccine adviser Robert Malone, writing that Malone “speculates RFK Jr. may have an important announcement this month regarding a potential link between Tylenol, multiple vaccinations and autism in children.”
“I was sick to my stomach,” Bauer said, concerned that Kennedy would link her study to discredited theories, causing doctors and scientists to reject her far more measured work.
  ‘The Boy Who Cried Wolf’ 

Several medical and scientific associations have called for Kennedy’s removal or resignation. Many scientists are skeptical of what he says because much of it has been misleading or wrong. For example, he’s said HIV isn’t the only cause of AIDS (it is), that antidepressant drugs cause mass shootings (they don’t), that older adults don’t have severe autism (some do), that the measles vaccine causes brain swelling (it doesn’t), that covid vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made (they aren’t), that vaccines aren’t safety-tested (they are), and that vaccines contribute to autism (they don’t).
“This is like the boy who cried wolf,” said Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel University. “One day he might be right about something and Americans who are not prone to conspiracies won’t trust it because it’s coming from RFK’s mouth. And that could be a problem.”
What’s more, the Trump administration is eroding scientists’ ability to probe the safety of pharmaceuticals, said Robert Steinbrook, head of health research at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection group.
“Public Citizen is very supportive of research on medications that could be linked to diseases,” he said. “But it needs to be through an open process, which looks at scientific evidence, and which doesn’t cherry-pick studies to support a preconceived point of view.”
Steinbrook said the administration has undermined his confidence in the government’s ability to conduct credible work. The Food and Drug Administration has held less than a third the number of advisory committee meetings this year as it did last, meaning fewer opportunities for experts to discuss research on the risks and benefits of drugs. The Trump administration has fired hundreds of career scientists at the CDC and FDA and cut millions of dollars in research funds, including to projects studying autism.
In early September, the CDC issued an unusual contract with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to analyze datasets for signs that vaccinated children were more likely to have autism. Unlike with other research initiatives, the CDC didn’t post an open call for applications in advance. This allows agency experts to review proposals and select studies best designed to answer the question at hand.
CDC researchers told KFF Health News that experts in the agency’s autism and disability group weren’t aware of the contract or asked to review the proposal. That’s important, they said, because researchers digging through data to find clues about autism must show how they’ll rule out biological and environmental exposures that muddy the results, and ensure that children have been accurately diagnosed. One researcher said, “It absolutely looks like Kennedy has subverted the grantmaking process.”
The CDC and HHS did not respond to KFF Health News’ requests for information on the grant, including through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The new vaccine study is separate from Kennedy’s autism data-science initiative, which was posted as an open call at the National Institutes of Health. “The hope is that something good comes of it, and that the government won’t cherry-pick or censor what scientists find out,” Lee said.
Bauer said she didn’t apply to be part of the initiative because of Kennedy’s outsize presence at HHS.
“I would not take his funding because it could take away from the credibility of my study,” she said, “in the same way that taking money from pharmaceutical companies does.”

This week, as we approach the first anniversary of Hurricane Helene – one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit western North Carolina – it’s important to take a look at how we’re doing. Where do we stand and what do we still need? Who is worthy of praise and who isn’t?
I’m a native of Buncombe County with family in the area stretching back multiple generations, so this is personal to me. And as someone who works advocating on environmental issues with our elected officials, I have a professional opinion as well.
In terms of the people impacted by this storm, my admiration and appreciation for their commitment to help their neighbors, combined with their grit, determination, and resilience in coming back from Helene’s devastating impact is off the charts. The people of western NC demonstrated why I’m proud to say that’s where I’m from.
Nonprofits also did an incredible job after the storm – organizations providing meals, putting solar microgrids in place to reestablish power, winter clothing donations and distribution, churches becoming community relief centers. The list goes on and on.
As for the government response, the reviews are more mixed. Local governments really stepped up. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, they worked to serve their communities and stand them back up. In many cases, they spent huge amounts of money based on the reimbursement promise of the federal government. This is normal following natural disasters.
At the state level, then-Governor Roy Cooper was on the ground almost immediately after the storm. He was in constant contact with state and federal agencies to mobilize resources. His leadership was critical.
When current Governor Josh Stein took office in January, he made recovery from Helene a top priority from day one. He has been a constant presence – working to move rebuilding forward, especially opening roads and bridges that allow commerce to flow. He established the Governor’s Recovery Office for Western NC (GROW NC) with a focus on incorporating greater resilience in rebuilding to help prepare for future storms. And he and first lady Anna Stein have spent significant time in the region to encourage others to visit and spend tourism dollars that are vital to the regional economy. Last week, he traveled to Washington to detail additional funding requests, while urging previously approved money be released (more on that in a minute).
The Republican majority in the state legislature has been unimpressive. After the November election, they used Helene relief as cover for a partisan power grab. This year, they have consistently provided less support for recovery than Gov. Stein requested. Most significantly, they have not provided relief funds for small businesses who are struggling to survive.
Our Congressional delegation and Congress have generally been responsive. They initially passed nearly $10 billion in Helene relief. Hopefully, they will be receptive to the next round of requests from Gov. Stein.
The biggest obstacle to recovery has been the current administration, especially the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees FEMA) and the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been the opposite of efficient. They have both held up prompt distribution of relief funds.
So far, the federal government has only distributed approximately $3.8 billion of the $10 billion already appropriated by Congress. This is pathetic.
In total, federal support to date amounts to approximately 9% of the total damage western North Carolina suffered. By comparison, storms that were similarly devastating – such as Hurricanes Katrina, Maria, and Sandy – saw more than 70% of the cost of recovery efforts covered by federal funding. Gov. Stein’s $23 billion request last week would bring the federal support North Carolina received to 47%.
North Carolinians aren’t looking for a handout. We just want to be treated fairly and want the money to arrive before it’s too late. Farmers, small businesses, and local governments are hanging by a thread. We need officials in Washington to do their job and act with urgency, not hide behind empty rhetoric about creating efficiency.
The increasing frequency of extreme weather is a new reality for people across North Carolina, and across the country. We need the federal government to get better at relief and recovery, not worse.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-4-1024x642.jpeg,,,2025-09-23 12:57:32.902628

(Image via University of New England)A research team from the University of New England published a report Monday that showed the extensive coastal damage caused by the January 2024 storms, including the destruction of more than a quarter of coastal dunes along four beaches in southern Maine. 
Will Kochtitzky, an assistant professor in the School of Marine and Environmental Programs, and a team of six current and former students found that beaches in Saco, Biddeford and Kennebunkport lost 28% of coastal dunes in the back-to-back storms that hit the state on Jan. 10 and Jan. 13. Their findings were published Monday in the journal Geomorphica.
“The data sets we collect are really unique,” Kochtitzky said. “We plan to continue our coastal erosion monitoring efforts to support coastal Maine communities in the years ahead.” 
Dunes serve as the first line of defense along the coast, protecting homes, roads and wildlife habitat during severe storms. 
The Jan. 13 storm brought Maine’s highest water level on record. Across the four shorelines the team studied, the damage varied with the most extreme loss resulting in dune areas almost being cut in half. The researchers also found that only 10% to 50% of dune volume was recovered nine months after the storm. 
Bipartisan leaders come together to try to make Maine more resilient to extreme weather

However, their work showed restoration efforts, including beach scraping and dune grass planting, to be more effective than taking no action. With severe storms expected to become more frequent, “restoration efforts may be essential for the recovery, longevity, and stability of dunes and beach faces,” the report noted. 
The research team mapped the devastation using drone photography that produced two- and three-dimensional models. Their work provided data that can be used by Maine coastal communities to prepare for severe weather events in the future, according to a news release from the Biddeford-based university. 
The two January storms, in addition to a third severe storm that ravaged the coast a month earlier in December 2023, caused an estimated $90 million in damage to public infrastructure across Maine. Earlier this year, Gov. Janet Mills signed a three-part proposal into law to improve emergency communications, create funding opportunities to make Maine homes more resilient and establish a new State Resilience Office to address flooding and other impacts.
Of the six students who worked on the project, four of them —  Johanna Birchem, Bryan Corvelo, Tyler Janik, Ruth Ellis — are current UNE students. The other two students, Katelyn DeWater and Paige-Marie Merrill, graduated in 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The team gathered the data as part of Kochtitzky’s geographic information systems courses and additional research, which was funded by the Maine Space Grant Consortium and the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund.  
The UNE students also created a website to share their research in a more accessible format.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Nine states are swapping voter rolls with Texas, and officials say the agreement will “improve the accuracy of voter registration records.”
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab’s office announced the partnership Thursday, describing it as a way to identify duplicate registrations. Schwab, who is running for governor, said the agreement with Texas helps Kansas to maintain accurate voter rolls, which bolsters election integrity and administration.
The basis of Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson’s agreements with Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia is outlined in memoranda that allow the states to exchange voter registration data with Texas while “adhering to strict confidentiality and cybersecurity protocols.”
“This is a common sense step toward cleaner rolls and better election administration,” Schwab said. “We look forward to establishing agreements with other states in the future.”
Schwab said the agreement is part of a growing trend among states. Any duplicate registrations or instances of potential voter fraud identified through the data swapping would be referred to the appropriate authorities for further investigation, Nelson’s office said.
The agreement comes as some Republican secretaries of state, Schwab included, are resisting turning over sensitive voter information to the U.S. Department of Justice. A spokesperson for the Kansas Secretary of State’s office, Whitney Tempel, said Texas can’t share other states’ data with the federal government. A provision in the agreement prohibits states from sharing data with any third party.
“Secretary Schwab has been steadily adding new tools throughout his tenure to improve voter list maintenance, and this agreement is another step in that ongoing effort,” Tempel said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas sued the state in 2018 over privacy concerns for its use of Crosscheck, a program that had been used to compare voter data across state lines. The program produced false positives 99% of the time, and officials mistakenly exposed sensitive information, including partial Social Security numbers, of nearly 1,000 Kansas voters under former Secretary of State Kris Kobach.
Schwab settled the case after he took office in 2019 by agreeing not to use the program.
The ACLU of Kansas is not convinced the agreement with Texas is much different than Crosscheck. Esmie Tseng, a spokesperson for the organization, said in a statement that the agreements politicize the right to vote and undermine “every Kansas voter’s right to privacy.” The organization fears the agreement will put thousands of Kansans’ data at risk because of “how insecure and error-prone government databases and sharing processes are,” she said.
“This is another example of how politicians are weaponizing xenophobia and the total myth of voter fraud to remove eligible voters from the rolls and attack our fundamental right to vote,” the statement said. “Secretary Schwab may claim this is not the same as Crosscheck, but there is little evidence of how he has moved to meaningfully ensure Kansans will be protected from data breaches or being removed incorrectly.”
Voter fraud is extremely rare in Kansas. The ACLU won a high-profile legal battle with Kobach in 2018 when he failed to prove his claims of widespread voter fraud.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6210915-e1731703263270-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-09-23 11:59:39.746762

Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday that a state board made up of the governor and the Florida Cabinet will vote to dedicate land at Miami Dade College next to the Freedom Tower to house the presidential library of Donald Trump. Their announcement came shortly after the Miami Dade College’s Board […],"The Freedom Tower (Photo from Miami Dade College)Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday that a state board made up of the governor and the Florida Cabinet will vote to dedicate land at Miami Dade College next to the Freedom Tower to house the presidential library of Donald Trump.
Their announcement came shortly after the Miami Dade College’s Board of Trustees approved the transfer of property earlier on Tuesday, as reported by the Miami Herald.
The governor’s office said in a press release that he and the Cabinet, meeting as the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, will propose an item to convey a 2.63 acre parcel for the Donald J. Presidential Library. That board consists of the governor, the attorney general, the chief financial officer, and the commissioner of agriculture. It is responsible for the acquisition, management, protection, and disposition of state lands.
All are elected independently statewide and all are Republicans.
“President Trump has achieved results for the American people and made a lasting impact on our nation’s history,” DeSantis said in a press release. “No state has better delivered the President’s agenda than the Free State of Florida, and we would be honored to house his presidential library here in his home state.”
“I’ll be voting yes!” Uthmeier added in a video posted on X. “Surviving two assassination attempts, securing the border, and rebuilding our nation’s military are just a few stories this great library will tell.”
The video goes on to show Uthmeier walking near the Freedom Tower, located on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami. The Freedom Tower was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2008 for its role in hosting people fleeing communist Cuba for Florida following the 1959 Cuban revolution.
“I can think of no better location to tell the story of Donald Trump,” Uthmeier says in the video. “A story of strength. One of redemption, one of victory, and one of sacrifice for the American people. It is the greatest political comeback story in history.”
Uthmeier is running unopposed for the Republican nomination of attorney general but has not been endorsed by the president ahead of the 2026 election. There has been speculation that “people close to Trump” have been courting Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez to challenge Uthmeier next year.
It’s not a surprise that Trump’s library will be located in South Florida. Officials close to the president, including Eric Trump and Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the United Nations, had been discussing possible sites in the region for months, NBC News reported earlier this year. The story reported that officials at Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University were lobbying to land the site.
The Florida Legislature earlier this year passed legislation (SB 118) that banned local governments in the state from interfering with any plans to construct a presidential library in Florida. The bill passed 36-3 in the GOP-controlled Senate and 89-20 in the GOP-controlled House.
‘Irony’
One of the Democrats who opposed the measure, Rep. Angie Nixon (D-Jacksonville), at the time found “irony” in what the House was doing.
“If we are going to support bringing this library here, we should support returning citizens all across the board, and not attack returning citizens, especially when they want to do things like vote, because we have one of the biggest returning citizens a/k/a felons in the administration right now,” she said, referring to Trump being found guilty in May 2024 in a New York courtroom on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money.
She referred to the 2018 constitutional amendment that legalized felons in Florida who had completed their sentence to be able to vote. However, an implementing bill in the following legislative session significantly narrowed the number of felons who can actually vote.
The president ultimately received an unconditional discharge. That meant that while the conviction stands, he will face no additional penalties, such as prison time, fines, or probation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-23 14:30:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"‘Sick to my stomach’: Trump distorts facts on autism, Tylenol and vaccines, scientists say",Amy Maxmen | KFF Health News,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/23/trump-autism-tylenol-vaccines/,"CDC autism experts weren't consulted on the White House's announcement or asked to review a draft of findings and recommendations, they said.","Ann Bauer, a researcher who studies Tylenol and autism, felt queasy with anxiety in the weeks leading up to the White House’s much-anticipated autism announcement.
In August, Bauer and her colleagues published an analysis of 46 previous studies on Tylenol, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many found no link between the drug and the conditions, while some suggested Tylenol might occasionally exacerbate other potential causes of autism, such as genetics.
Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and her team called for more judicious use of the drug until the science is settled.
On Monday, President Donald Trump stood beside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a “historic” announcement on autism. “If you’re pregnant, don’t take Tylenol, and don’t give it to the baby after the baby is born,” Trump said. “There are certain groups of people that don’t take vaccines and don’t take any pills that have no autism,” he added, without providing evidence. “They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace.”
A fact sheet released alongside the White House briefing cited Bauer’s analysis. But she was alarmed by Trump’s comments. If prenatal Tylenol has any association, which it may not, it would help account for only a fraction of cases, she said. Further, research has not deeply examined Tylenol risks in young children, and many rigorous studies refute a link between vaccines and autism.
Bauer worries such statements will cut both ways: People may put themselves at risk to avoid vaccines and Tylenol, the only safe painkiller for use during pregnancy. And she frets that scientists might outright reject her team’s measured concerns about Tylenol in a backlash against misleading remarks from Trump and other members of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement.
“I’m really concerned about how this message is going to play out,” she said. “It’s a sound-bite universe, and everyone wants a simple solution.”
Autism experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were neither consulted for the White House’s long-awaited autism announcement nor asked to review a draft of the findings and recommendations, CDC scientists told KFF Health News, which agreed not to identify them because they fear retaliation.
“Typically, we’d be asked to provide information and review the report for accuracy, but we’ve had absolutely no contact with anyone,” one CDC researcher said. “It is very unusual.”
Trump and Kennedy promised this year that under their leadership the federal government would swiftly figure out what causes autism. Scientists who work in the field have been skeptical, noting that decades of research has shown that no single drug, chemical, or other environmental factor is strongly linked to the developmental disorder. In addition, both Trump and Kennedy have repeated the scientifically debunked notion that childhood vaccines may cause autism.
Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University, called Trump’s comments dangerous. Fevers can harm the mother and the developing fetus, she said, adding that fevers are more strongly associated with autism than Tylenol.
In an emailed response to queries, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America’s unprecedented rise in autism rates.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote, “President Trump pledged to address America’s rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science.”
Had CDC scientists been allowed to brief Kennedy, they say they would have cautioned that simple fixes won’t make a dent in the number of autism cases in the United States: As many as 1 in 31 8-year-old children had autism spectrum disorder in 2022.
Systemic changes, such as regulations on air pollution, which has been linked to asthma and developmental disabilities including autism, and assistance for parents of disabled children, could improve lives for far more Americans with autism and other conditions than actions taken by the Trump administration on Sept. 22, researchers say.
One federal action is to consider updating the label on Tylenol and to “encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.” The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends acetaminophen “as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”
‘Political Crusade’
Despite Kennedy’s many years of speaking about autism, he rarely cites credible autism research or expert recommendations, Tager-Flusberg said. Instead, Kennedy repeats fringe, scientifically debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, despite rigorous studies published in peer-reviewed journals that refute a link.
At the Sept. 22 briefing, Trump said he spoke with Kennedy about autism 20 years ago: “We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it,” he said. Ahead of Trump’s first term in 2017, Kennedy said he met with the president to consider a commission on vaccine safety and autism. It didn’t happen then. But soon after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary, he called autism “preventable,” pointed to “environmental toxins,” and contradicted the results of a CDC study finding that the main driver of rising autism diagnoses was that doctors increasingly recognize the disorder.
At a televised Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump, “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.”
“You stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it’s a shot,” Trump replied.
“He is on a political crusade,” Tager-Flusberg said of Kennedy, adding that vaccines, Tylenol, aluminum, and food dyes make for simple targets to rally against. “We know genetics is the most significant risk factor,” she said, “but you can’t blame Big Pharma for genetics, and you can’t build a political movement on genetics research and ride to victory.”
“RFK makes our work harder,” said Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the author of a book about his autistic daughter, “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism.” He said the book stemmed from conversations with Kennedy in 2017, in which Hotez shared studies pinpointing more than a hundred genes linked to autism, and research into the complex interplay between genetics, biological processes, and things that children and fetuses encounter during development.
“I sat down with him and explained what the science says, but he was unwilling or incapable of thinking deeply about it,” Hotez said. “He is extremely careless.”
In addition to its focus on Tylenol, the White House said it would move to update “prescribing information” on leucovorin — a medication related to the B vitamin folate — to reflect its use as an autism treatment. A small clinical trial in 2012-13 suggested the drug may help treat language problems in some children with autism. Tager-Flusberg said the findings warrant further study but clarified these were “old data, not a breakthrough.”
Likewise, studies finding a modest association between autism and prolonged Tylenol use were published years ago. Researchers have suggested the medicine might occasionally exacerbate factors associated with autism, such as genetics and oxidative stress, a biological condition that occurs for a variety of reasons that scientists are still unraveling.
Still, these studies couldn’t rule out the possibility that fevers prompting women to take Tylenol, rather than the medicine itself, might instead be to blame. Fevers and infections — including those prevented by vaccines — have also been linked to autism.
Nonetheless, Bauer’s recommendation would be to pause before taking acetaminophen while pregnant — blanket advice that doctors give for all medications during that period, but which may be ignored. “Try to alleviate discomfort in some other ways, like with a cold compress, hydration, or massage, before taking it,” Bauer said.
She welcomed the White House’s motion to consider labeling Tylenol to emphasize judicious use of the drug but worries about how the MAHA movement might distort a careful message. On Sept. 2, the right-wing news outlet One America News Network posted an interview with newly appointed CDC vaccine adviser Robert Malone, writing that Malone “speculates RFK Jr. may have an important announcement this month regarding a potential link between Tylenol, multiple vaccinations and autism in children.”
“I was sick to my stomach,” Bauer said, concerned that Kennedy would link her study to discredited theories, causing doctors and scientists to reject her far more measured work.
‘The boy who cried wolf’
Several medical and scientific associations have called for Kennedy’s removal or resignation. Many scientists are skeptical of what he says because much of it has been misleading or wrong. For example, he’s said HIV isn’t the only cause of AIDS (it is), that antidepressant drugs cause mass shootings (they don’t), that older adults don’t have severe autism (some do), that the measles vaccine causes brain swelling (it doesn’t), that covid vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made (they aren’t), that vaccines aren’t safety-tested (they are), and that vaccines contribute to autism (they don’t).
“This is like the boy who cried wolf,” said Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel University. “One day he might be right about something and Americans who are not prone to conspiracies won’t trust it because it’s coming from RFK’s mouth. And that could be a problem.”
What’s more, the Trump administration is eroding scientists’ ability to probe the safety of pharmaceuticals, said Robert Steinbrook, head of health research at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection group.
“Public Citizen is very supportive of research on medications that could be linked to diseases,” he said. “But it needs to be through an open process, which looks at scientific evidence, and which doesn’t cherry-pick studies to support a preconceived point of view.”
Steinbrook said the administration has undermined his confidence in the government’s ability to conduct credible work. The Food and Drug Administration has held less than a third the number of advisory committee meetings this year as it did last, meaning fewer opportunities for experts to discuss research on the risks and benefits of drugs. The Trump administration has fired hundreds of career scientists at the CDC and FDA and cut millions of dollars in research funds, including to projects studying autism.
In early September, the CDC issued an unusual contract with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to analyze datasets for signs that vaccinated children were more likely to have autism. Unlike with other research initiatives, the CDC didn’t post an open call for applications in advance. This allows agency experts to review proposals and select studies best designed to answer the question at hand.
CDC researchers told KFF Health News that experts in the agency’s autism and disability group weren’t aware of the contract or asked to review the proposal. That’s important, they said, because researchers digging through data to find clues about autism must show how they’ll rule out biological and environmental exposures that muddy the results, and ensure that children have been accurately diagnosed. One researcher said, “It absolutely looks like Kennedy has subverted the grantmaking process.”
The CDC and HHS did not respond to KFF Health News’ requests for information on the grant, including through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The new vaccine study is separate from Kennedy’s autism data-science initiative, which was posted as an open call at the National Institutes of Health. “The hope is that something good comes of it, and that the government won’t cherry-pick or censor what scientists find out,” Lee said.
Bauer said she didn’t apply to be part of the initiative because of Kennedy’s outsize presence at HHS.
“I would not take his funding because it could take away from the credibility of my study,” she said, “in the same way that taking money from pharmaceutical companies does.”

The Delaware Department of Agriculture has confirmed the presence of a box tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis) in New Castle County during inspections of traps set along the New Castle County-Kent County border.
The box tree moth is a federally regulated pest that primarily targets boxwood species (Buxus spp.), a popular evergreen shrub used in landscaping. Left unchecked, it can cause extensive damage and even kill the plants.
This is the first discovery of the insect in New Castle County. Delaware first confirmed a box tree moth in Kent County in July 2024, three years after the pest was first detected in the United States in 2021.
“We continue to work closely with our partners at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and University of Delaware extension to monitor this invasive pest,” said Jeffrey Brothers, Delaware Department of Agriculture’s Plant Industries Administrator. 
“A box tree moth caterpillar can quickly defoliate boxwoods and remain active until September or October. Homeowners and nurseries should be on the lookout for signs of damage to their plants.”

The caterpillars can grow up to 1.5 inches and are identified by their lime-green color, black stripes, white spots, hair, and shiny black heads. They produce heavy webbing on plants and can completely defoliate host shrubs. After leaves are stripped, they feed on bark, eventually killing the plant.
Adult box tree moths typically have white wings bordered with thick brown. They are most active at night and can sometimes be mistaken for melonworm moths.
What residents can do
Delawareans are urged to help prevent the spread of the pest by monitoring and managing infestations. Signs to watch for include brown or skeletonized leaves, defoliation, and webbing with caterpillars present.
Guidance on insecticide options is available here. Officials remind homeowners that “the label is the law. Always read and follow the pesticide label.”
For infestations, homeowners are advised to remove affected boxwood branches or, in severe cases, cut shrubs to the base. Plants can regrow from the roots, but debris must be double-bagged in plastic and placed in the trash.
Nursery businesses are encouraged to closely monitor their boxwoods and report any detections to the Delaware Department of Agriculture at DDA_PlantPests@delaware.gov.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th. 
The divisions in American politics are usually obvious, often nowhere more than in the House of Representatives. But there are also glimmers of bipartisanship, and, lately, many of those have been driven by women.
At the start of this year, Reps. Brittany Pettersen, a Democrat, and Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican, united forces to challenge House leadership with a push to make the House friendlier for new mothers. More recently, three of the most outspoken House Republican women broke ranks with their party — and bucked President Donald Trump — in an effort to release more files related to the case of the late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
And earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida and Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California came together on a House resolution calling for expanded early screening for Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), a blood-clotting disorder that can cause miscarriages and stillbirths.
They credited their cooperation to singer Christina Perri, who learned she had APS after losing her daughter Rosie late in pregnancy in 2020. Perri is now channeling her grief into advocacy. She said in an interview that it was “a privilege” to see lawmakers like Kamlager-Dove and Cammack putting their party affiliations to the side and uniting on an issue so important to her.
“What matters is that we’re women, we’re moms, we just want other women and moms to be okay,” she said. “And I find that really inspiring at a time where everything is just so messy, and I feel grateful to be a part of something like this.”
Women make up half of the U.S. population but hold just 28% of seats in Congress.
Research has not backed up the notion that women lawmakers are, overall, more bipartisan than men at the federal level. But select instances so far in this Congress show how unlikely coalitions of women lawmakers have united across party lines, challenged party leadership or both.
A major news conference at the Capitol with Epstein survivors in early September yielded what four years ago would have been an all but unthinkable scene: Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a progressive Democrat, defending and embracing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and staunch Trump ally.
“She has shown so much courage on this issue, so much leadership,” Khanna said of Greene, who was met with an uneven reception by the crowd. “I saw some people, when I was coming here, calling her names. We’ve got to stop that. We’ve got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”
Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are attempting to force a House floor vote on the Epstein files resolution with a procedural measure known as a discharge petition, which enables members to circumvent House leadership to get a measure to the floor.
Every sitting House Democrat and just three Republicans other than Massie — Greene, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina — have signed the discharge petition, leaving it just one signature short of the 218 required to force a vote.
All three women have maintained their support for the measure despite fierce opposition from Trump and the White House. At the news conference, Massie called Greene “the bravest woman in Congress.” He also posed the question: “Where are the men?”
“Never underestimate a woman,” Boebert said at the Capitol. “We all came here to do work. We all made promises, and some of us live up to them.”
Shared experiences around pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood have united some House members to work across the aisle.
“I think I can say very candidly now, as a new mom, moms just know how to multitask and learn how to get things done,” said Cammack, who welcomed her daughter Auggie last month. “And that might be why you see more bipartisan efforts coming out of the women, even though we represent a minority in Congress.”
At the Sept. 9 news conference, Kamlager-Dove, Cammack and Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio all spoke about their experiences with pregnancy losses while building their families.
“What unites us is far deeper than what may appear on the surface,” Kamlager-Dove said. “Many of us share journeys to parenthood that are marked by hope, loss and eventually, resilience.”
Luna, the Florida Republican, and Pettersen, the Colorado Democrat, are also among the handful of House members to give birth while in office — and both missed votes after giving birth.
They teamed up on a measure to allow new parents in the House to temporarily designate another member to vote for them, also known as proxy voting.
House Speaker Mike Johnson vigorously opposed the effort, leading the duo to turn to a discharge petition. They succeeded in getting 218 votes on their discharge petition and overcame Johnson’s effort to quash the measure on the floor, temporarily grinding House business to a halt. Luna later struck a deal with Johnson, standing down on the proxy voting push in exchange for other concessions (Pettersen and other Democrats criticized the deal as insufficient).
Now, Luna is a member of another bipartisan coalition, this one backing a proposed ban on stock trading for members of Congress.
Another member of the group, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a progressive Democrat, said at a Sept. 3 news conference that, unlike in other legislative negotiations, lawmakers turned around a better product than the one they started with.
“It is one of those rare moments where I feel like Washington is working the way it’s supposed to work,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And it feels foreign. And it feels alien … but I also think it is proof that things can work here.”
Women lawmakers “are better communicators,” Luna told The 19th while leaving House votes Sept. 9. At the stock trading ban news conference days earlier, she indicated she’s prepared to challenge House leadership again if necessary.
“I often feel like an adjudicator in this job,” she said. “And so, I guess I’ll be the one to say that we’ve asked nicely for leadership to put this on the floor. If they don’t, I say timeline is end of month: There’s a discharge petition that is ready to go.”
The most consequential legislation passed by Congress this year has been muscled through without Democratic support, and there have been plenty of moments of acrimony on the floor.
Much of it has been clearly gendered: As the House considered its annual defense spending bill, Mace erupted at Rep. Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat, during debate over Mace’s proposed anti-transgender amendments to the legislation. Rep. Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who this year became the first openly transgender lawmaker to serve in Congress, has faced repeated attacks and misgendering from some of her Republican colleagues.
High-profile but not expressly political public figures have, in many cases, been the catalysts for bipartisan congressional action.
Years of tireless lobbying by Paris Hilton led to Congress passing a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing child abuse and neglect in youth residential facilities last December.
Engineer, author and science TV host Emily Calandrelli’s personal story of being hassled by TSA as a new parent led to the Senate and a House committee passing bipartisan legislation making it easier for parents to travel with breast milk and breastfeeding equipment through airport security. The legislation has not received a vote on the House floor.
And Epstein’s survivors, Khanna said, are “helping us come together as a country.”
“I’ve never done a press conference with Marjorie Taylor Greene before,” he joked at the Sept. 3 news conference.
Both Cammack and Kamlager-Dove credited Perri with using her platform to raise awareness about APS — and bringing them together on a mission to promote the adoption of what they said is a simple test that could spare so many the heartache of pregnancy loss.
“We bonded over a common story of having a miscarriage and wanting answers to questions that were not easy to come by,” Kamlager-Dove said.
“Without her advocacy, without her courage to come forward, this wouldn’t be happening, and so she has been the driver in really bringing us together to make this a reality,” Cammack said.
Cammack said she’s “very confident” about the resolution on APS testing moving forward and getting a vote on the House floor. Perri said the measure’s passing would be “a win for everybody,” and a victory “that feels kind of rare right now.”
“My hope and goal is to have this changed forever, for women to not need to even know about it,” she said. “But until then, I will always speak about it, and I will help move the needle forward.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitolmay72025-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 10:57:47.434748

The future of our state is inextricably linked to the future of its largest city.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Matt Wormser: An open letter to Gov. Phil Scott about Burlington.","Dear Gov. Phil Scott,


I rode into my office in Burlington in late August, enjoying the new bike paths along the Champlain Parkway and Pine Street along the way. Church Street was alive with the return of students, and the waterfront was similarly vibrant with walkers, bikers and people out enjoying the glory days of late summer. 
I noticed that the new Burlington Square building was looking great, and the painfully slow infrastructure improvements along Main Street and beyond were likewise starting to reveal their final form. 
Also evident in my midday walk through City Hall Park were the well-documented substance use and homelessness issues facing Burlington. These were issues that you discussed briefly in your Aug. 20 press conference, resulting in some “he said-she said” back and forth press with Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak. If I could summarize your comments during your conference, they were that your administration was certainly willing to help but that you were in effect waiting for the phone to ring.

During your conference, you also took issue with the characterization of Burlington as the “economic engine” of the state. To that I respectfully disagree. 
Chittenden County — with Burlington as our epicenter — represents 26% of Vermont’s population but generates 37% of Vermont’s gross domestic product and 35% of its income taxes. Vermonters likewise continue to vote with their feet — 61% of Vermont’s population growth since the year 2000 went Chittenden County — presumably drawn to higher-paying jobs, a vibrant civic life and other opportunities. 
The future of our state is inextricably linked to the future of its largest city.
Scott, I’ll note that I have voted for you on multiple occasions, but if there’s been a critique of your leadership, I have too often heard it’s that you show up long enough to veto the bill without sufficient engagement in crafting it along the way. Whether that’s fair or not, Burlington — and Vermont, by extension — needs your more active involvement to address challenges that fall disproportionately on Burlington that are not the fault of city policy. 
Whatever policy differences I might have with Burlington Progressives — and there are many — I don’t believe they convinced the Sackler family to get a generation of Americans hooked on opioids. I don’t think they caused the nationwide housing shortage and resulting homelessness epidemic. I don’t think they contributed to our insufficient mental health support system, among other issues. 
While the Burlington City Council has belatedly responded to community requests for increased enforcement — especially in City Hall Park — fixing the city’s problems is going to require your administration’s active engagement and in building solutions well beyond recommendations for more enforcement. 
What are opportunities for increased administration involvement? Let’s start with proactive outreach to Mulvaney-Stanak — along with city leaders suffering similar issues in Rutland, Brattleboro and beyond. 
This would help to not only to coordinate statewide policy solutions, but also to increase Vermont State Police’s focus on combatting drug trafficking throughout the state, propose a viable replacement to the motel program, address judiciary and prosecutor shortages, move the police academy to Chittenden County where a majority of recent graduates can more easily attend, or implement similar measures to reduce our policing shortages, among a range of other items. 
Most importantly, however, simply showing up to demonstrate your renewed commitment to supporting the — yes — economic engine of Vermont through your words and actions. 
For many years Chittenden County tax dollars have disproportionately subsidized small schools and provided policing in rural parts of the state, disproportionately funded health care and housing for needy Vermonters, and likewise disproportionately helped with road-building and recovery efforts when the floodwaters rise in Burke, Barre, Ludlow and beyond. 
Well, the floodwaters have risen in Burlington with the trifecta of housing shortages, a national opioid crisis and inadequate mental health services, and Vermont needs your active leadership to help solve it. 
For the good of our state, please step it up.

This type of landslide is among many different types described in a newly published state landslide inventory. (Photo  by Jeff Pedersen/Alaska Wildland Adventures/Provided by the U.S. Geological Survey)More than 10,000 known Alaska landslides or landslide-related events are documented in a new state inventory intended to help improve understanding of risks and what can be done to improve safety.
The inventory, published by the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, is intended to be integrated into a national landslide inventory maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey.
It will be updated as more information is collected, said Jillian Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the division’s landslide hazards program.
“This is the first step just to sort of get everything in one place,” Nicolazzo said. “Now that we see what we have, we can start looking at what we don’t have and start filling in the gaps.”
To compile the inventory, state scientists pored over more than 1,000 USGS maps and reviewed aerial imagery, published news accounts and other information on where landslides have occurred in the past. Many of those USGS maps dated back to the 1950s, when the agency was trying to scope out opportunities for mineral extraction or infrastructure development, Nicolazzo said.
“They weren’t looking for landslides. They were just trying to map the geology. And if they happened to see landslides too, they might have noted it on the maps, but they also might not have,” she said.
One map that contributed to the inventory is even older; it was created in 1915.
The new searchable landslide inventory features an Alaska map with colored dots representing the type of event that occurred at each site. Some are slides in which unstable upper layers detach from more stable lower layers. Some are abrupt falls that send rocks or boulders tumbling. Some are considered “flows,” a category that includes the continually moving frozen debris lobes dotting the Brooks Range. Some are considered thaw events. Those and other types of events are described in the inventory.
The dots on the map fill most of the southern half of the state, from the eastern Interior to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and are spread across the Brooks Range in the Arctic. The relatively empty spaces do not necessarily represent a lack of landslides, Nicolazzo said. Rather, those reflect a lack of reports, she said.
So far, the inventory includes only some of the events that have occurred in Southeast Alaska, where slides have killed 12 people in the past decade. That region of the state is already covered by an extensive and periodically updated inventory of landslides in the Tongass National Forest, which comprises most of the Southeast region.
While much of the information used for the inventory is old, Alaska’s landslide monitoring work is relatively new, at least when compared to the programs that have been underway for decades in countries like Norway and Switzerland.
The Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys’ landslide hazards program was established only three years ago, and the inventory has been one of its major projects.
Compared to those other countries, “we’re in the beginning stages. But we have to start somewhere,” Nicolazzo said.
To meet the challenge, agencies have mounted a group effort, she said.
“The state is very large, and we don’t have a lot of state employees working on it. There aren’t a lot of federal employees working on it,” she said. “We tag-team different tasks to each of our strengths.”
Funding to support the effort is also limited, she said. She pointed to the multiagency work monitoring the high-risk Barry Arm landslide site in Prince William Sound as evidence of that.
“There is a lot of money spent on equipment looking just at that one landslide, and we know it’s not the only one in the area,” she said. “It would require a lot more money than we have available to monitor everything the same as we’re monitoring that one.”

Longtime Burlington musician Kevin Bloom is trying their hand at politics, announcing their early bid for Chittenden County sheriff on Sept. 9. After landing on the ballot for the 2026 race, Bloom has carried on collecting signatures across the county as means of getting the word out about their campaign. 
As of Monday, Bloom, 31, has garnered 168 signatures from 14 of the 18 municipalities in the county: Burlington, South Burlington, Winooski, Williston, Colchester, Essex, Essex Junction, St. George, Huntington Shelburne, Richmond, Jericho, Hinesburg and Charlotte. 
“It’s been amazing. I’ve been going around to different towns and just talking to people,” Bloom said. “I’ve talked to a bunch of landlords. I’ve talked to tenants. I’ve talked to young people. Older people. People my age. People who have lived here for a while. People who just moved here. Immigrants to America. People whose families have been here for a while.”
Bloom’s main platform as a Democratic candidate for Chittenden County sheriff is to end the blanket enforcement of evictions, which they called “a radical investment in our community, that would have some pretty profound results.” Bloom said they would like to cultivate relationships with tenants, landlords, housing developers and community organizations, and connect people with resources to prevent them from losing housing.
“What’s affecting everyone in the county is the housing crisis, and so people who I have talked to on all ends of the political spectrum have agreed that this is a pretty serious problem that’s affecting people in our community in immeasurably negative ways,” Bloom said. “A common theme has been a real resonance with the idea that we should address the problem and stop throwing people out into the street, especially families and especially children.”
Bloom said they did not support people withholding rent, and acknowledged there are some uncommon circumstances where eviction may be necessary.
But Bloom said eviction could be avoided in the vast majority of cases if people were connected with new housing options, job support or other resources. In the usual situation where an eviction is necessary, Bloom said that there should be more of an effort to connect people with the help rather than letting them slip through the cracks.
Along with addressing the “omnipresent” housing issue in Chittenden County, Bloom said they would like to be a resource to community members facing wage theft, hate crimes, racial profiling, and violence against the unhoused, helping connect people to the right entities to report crimes and gain justice. 
“These are small or large acts of violence against a community that people just in power seem to not really care about,” Bloom said. 
Bloom also said they would not assist federal Immigration, Customs and Enforcement officials’ actions in the county if requested. Bloom also said they want to serve as a mechanism of police oversight to provide accountability to address cases like Burlington police officers being accused of using excessive force this year and in previous years. 
Acknowledging the fear many may feel around law enforcement, Bloom said they want to change the relationship between the community and the Chittenden County Sheriff’s Office, if elected, by listening to residents’ needs.

Bloom also heads the Burlington-based experimental, psych-rock band The Dead Shakers, which released their sixth album, “Now That’s What I Call Missiles & Bombs 4 Kidz!,” on Sept. 19. With songs titled “To Conflate Jewishness With Zionism Is Itself A Profoundly Anti-Semetic Act, And I Question The Motives of Those Who Do Things Like This“ and “Silence is Violence,” Bloom said they worked to ensure their songs were “unco-optible into anything other than political statements.”
But Bloom said they view their music and creative expression about global issues — like what Bloom and the Vermont congressional delegation recognize as a genocide in Gaza — as important but separate from the everyday work of a local sheriff candidate doing local outreach. 
Bloom takes issue with the current direction of the sheriff’s office led by Daniel Gamelin, who has increasingly offered private businesses security services for hire, racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars for the department in 2024, according to Seven Days reporting. 
“The difference between a sheriff’s deputy and a private security guard is that the sheriff’s deputy is allowed to shoot someone if they deem it necessary, and I just don’t think that’s a service that should be offered by the state,” Bloom said. 
In the past election cycle, Gamelin was uncontested for the role in both the primary and general election, so Bloom said they are offering the county an alternative.
Gamelin wrote in an email Friday that he intends on running as an incumbent in 2026 but did not immediately respond to VTDigger for more information on his platform. 
“I want to continue the proud tradition of the Chittenden County Sheriff Office,” Gamelin wrote. “I have a great team here in Burlington and want to continue to build on that.”
Bloom is not collecting campaign donations, believing word of mouth is powerful enough to spread their message. Bloom said the funds would be “better spent buying a meal for someone living on the street and handing it to them.” 
“That would have a much bigger impact immediately,” Bloom said. 
Until Election Day in 2026, Bloom said their goal is to talk with constituents to generate ideas on how to help individuals and the county thrive. 
“I think community interaction is a huge component that they’re just not doing right now,” Bloom said. “The Sheriff’s Department could be such a resource for the community.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Blaise Ingoglia, appointed to serve as Florida’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in July, held a campaign event in Tampa on Monday night to kickoff his candidacy for 2026.
“My name is Blaise Ingoglia and I’m your current CFO from the great state of Florida and I am unapologetically conservative,” he said to several hundred people who crowded into the second floor of the Tampa Firefighters Museum.
Ingoglia, a homebuilder from Hernando County, was serving in the Florida Senate when Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to succeed Jimmy Patronis as CFO on July 21. He announced that he was running for a four-year term on Sept. 2, but that was a via a video release and written statement. On Monday night, his campaign opted for a splashy event, replete with food, alcohol, and a steady stream of ’70s and ’80s pop tunes playing to the attendees in advance of his speech.
The chief financial officer of Florida is one of three Cabinet-level positions in state government, along with the attorney general and agriculture commissioner, and goes up for election every four years. Together, they help the governor administer a number of state agencies. The CFO is the statutory head of the Department of Financial Services, which oversees more than a dozen agencies, including the State Fire Marshal, Consumer Services, and Inspector General. The position pays $140,000 a year.
The fight to reduce property taxes
Ingoglia has been in the news headlines constantly since his appointment by DeSantis earlier this summer. The two Republicans have been on an unofficial campaign to boost a still-to-written constitutional amendment next year that will ask voters whether they want to substantially reduce their property taxes.
Ingoglia has utilized two new state government agencies in that effort: DOGE (“Department of Governmental Efficiency”) and FAFO (the Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight) to scrutinize spending by local governments throughout the state. That’s been controversial, as Ingoglia has accused several local governments — many (but not all) controlled by Democrats — of excessive and “wasteful” spending.
That strategy was called out in an editorial in the Orlando Sentinel over the weekend.
“The motives are painfully obvious: State leaders are trying to amass proof that local governments are routinely overspending on ridiculous priorities,” says the editorial. “The next step, obviously, is to take away their ability to set property tax rates. That’s been the obvious destination from the start, and it is a straight path to disaster for Florida’s communities.”
Ingoglia said Monday that he has three big priorities: 1) Property tax relief, 2) Holding local governments accountable, and 3) Pushing down property insurance rates.
He said he “cut his teeth” two decades ago claiming that local governments had “gone wild” in their spending and it is funny that “what we are seeing right now is seeing government gone wild and run amok with a lot of our property tax dollars.”
Property Insurance
Another responsibility for the CFO is overseeing insurance regulation.
“We need to hold the insurance companies accountable to do what they say that they are going to do, what they are contractually obligated to pay, because if they don’t they’re going to get fined,” he said, drawing cheers. “I am not here to protect the profits of insurance companies. I am not here to protect the profits of trial attorneys. What I am here to do is protect you, the policyholders, and I will continue do that.”
Democrats question whether Ingoglia will do that.
“Floridians deserve a CFO who will stand up to the insurance companies and help make property insurance more affordable,” Democratic House Leader Fentrice Driskell said upon his appointment to succeed Patronis in July.
“Instead, Ron DeSantis is appointing a Tallahassee politician more loyal to him than to the people. I believe Blaise Ingoglia will talk tough but continue the tradition of giving the insurance companies everything they ask for while Florida’s working families and seniors pay the price.”
Ingoglia is native New Yorker and homebuilder who moved to Spring Hill in Hernando County (about 50 miles north of Tampa) in the mid-1990s. He was elected to the Florida House in 2014 and simultaneously served as Republican Party of Florida chairman from 2015 to 2019. He had served in the Senate since 2022.
The potential competition 
He’s a close political ally of Gov. DeSantis, who will be pushing for his election over the next year. The governor snubbed another Republican lawmaker who had previously announced his candidacy for CFO, Sarasota County’s Joe Gruters, who had already been endorsed by President Donald Trump. Early polls showed Gruters crushing Ingoglia in a presumptive Republican CFO primary in August 2026.
But that likely heavyweight matchup was averted after Trump elevated Gruters to lead the Republican National Committee. However, another Republican that Ingoglia may face next year is Rep. Kevin Steele, R-Dade City, former CEO of a health care technology company who announced on his 2022 financial disclosure form that he is worth more than $400 million.
Steele last week announced creation of a political committee called “Friends of Kevin Steele.” Earlier this month, Florida Politics reported that Steele was being “encouraged” to run by Trump — which could prove a headache for Ingoglia.
Ingoglia boasted to the crowd that he was the RPOF’s chair when Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016.
“I helped Donald Trump get elected in this state,” he said. “I was a campaign spokesman for him. An official surrogate in 2020. And that man is doing amazing things at the federal level right now.”
Two other Republicans have filed to run for CFO: Frank William Collige and Benjamin Horbowy. No Democrat has filed for the seat, according to the state’s Division of Elections website.
Ingoglia is a fiercely partisan Republican. He joked that when he growing up, his mother said that he could be anything he wanted, “So, I decided to become a problem for Democrats,” he said, generating laughs from the crowd. “And some Republicans, also,” he added.
In 2023, he filed a bill that, if enacted, would have eliminated the Florida Democratic Party. Dubbed “The Ultimate Cancel Act,” it was intended to “cancel” the filings of any party that previously advocated for slavery, which Southern Democrats did in the 19th Century. He later described the bill as a direct response to “leftist activists and their attempts to cancel people and companies.” (The bill never received a committee hearing).
He takes pride in being politically incorrect. He joked during his speech, “I’m a very big fan of DEI — and by that I mean deport every illegal.” In his video announcing his candidacy earlier this month, Ingoglia said that he spoke four languages: English, profanity, sarcasm and “real s—.”
During his tenure in the Legislature, Ingoglia sponsored some of DeSantis’ biggest priorities. In 2023, he led the way on SB 1718, a comprehensive crackdown on illegal immigration in Florida. That measure mandated the use of E-Verify for employers, banned the use of legally issued driver’s licenses from states that issue them regardless of immigration status, and provided $12 million in taxpayer dollars to fund a program that transported immigrants away from Florida.
Ingoglia also sponsored a bill that year that has made it much more difficult for teachers’ unions to collect dues and qualify to represent a bargaining unit.
Among those in attendance for the event were Pinellas County Sen. Nick DiCeglie (emcee of the event),  Rep. Danny Alvarez (R-Hillsborough), Rep. Jeff Holcomb (R-Spring Hill), and former Lakeland area Republican lawmaker Kelli Stargell.
Ingolgia declined to take questions from reporters following the event.

The National Housing Conference (NHC) recently released a report looking at how much people working in different professions must earn in order to afford a mortgage and rent nationwide.
In Connecticut, the report analyzed what it would cost to own a home in the cities of New Haven, Hartford, New London and Bridgeport. The costs associated with buying a home in those locations has increased by about 100% since 2019.
“We cannot think of this as a problem that only exists for a subset of people,” NHC Senior Policy and Research Associate Brittany Webb said. “This is something that matters in every community. Coastal. Non-coastal. This matters for every income level.”
In New Haven, New London and Hartford the income needed to purchase a home with 10% down has doubled, according to Webb. In Bridgeport, the income needed increased by 94%.
More than 30% of tracked occupations in those cities could afford to purchase a home in 2019. By 2024 in those cities, only 6% could afford to purchase, Webb said.
“There are examples of lawyers and dentists and groups of people that have extensive education and are earning high salaries that are still priced out of housing,” Webb said. “That’s what’s been, I think, the most shocking for us.”
Rent also became less attainable for people in many careers, Webb said.
In 2019, about 60% of people in the jobs included in the study could afford the $1,200 a month rent on a 2-bedroom apartment in Bridgeport, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
But by 2024 the average rent on a two bedroom apartment in Bridgeport rose to $1,600 dollars per month and less than 40% could afford rent at that price.
One of the key concerns is how wages haven’t increased in recent years to compensate for inflation and rising housing costs.
“If we don’t address the supply shortage, reform zoning, and invest in housing at all income levels, we are facing a fundamental threat to the health and sustainability of our economy,” NHC President and Chief Executive Officer David Dworkin said.
The study included nearly 400 communities and jobs ranging from lawyers and dentists to mechanics and teachers.
The report used data from NHC’s Paycheck to Paycheck database, which is updated quarterly to track affordability changes based on occupation and city.
“These findings underscore the depth and breadth of the housing crisis, which is increasingly pricing out working families across the country—regardless of geography or profession,” Dworkin said.

Immigration arrests at federal courthouses have taken up most of the national attention since Donald Trump became president, but across California, U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents are showing up at state courts and arresting undocumented immigrants, CalMatters Nigel Duara reports. 
It happened this summer in Fresno: A judge reportedly congratulated a man for completing a one-year court-ordered program following a domestic violence conviction last year. ICE agents were waiting outside the courthouse and arrested him. He’s since been deported to Mexico, his sister told Duara.
The man’s story isn’t unique. ICE agents have arrested at least two dozen other people at state courts in Stanislaus, Glenn, Los Angeles and Fresno counties. 
This summer in Butte County, immigration enforcement agents conducted an operation inside the county’s Oroville courthouse. That’s a violation of a 2019 California law that forbids civil arrests “in a courthouse while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”
Butte County’s court administrator is troubled by the courthouse arrests, since they discourage people fearful of being deported from attending routine court proceedings. 

Sharif Elmallah, Butte County Superior Court executive officer, in a statement: “The court is concerned by the potential chilling effect and other potential adverse impacts on participation in the legal system that may occur due to these enforcement actions being conducted in and around courthouses.”

Those who miss a mandatory court appearance in a criminal case can face additional charges. 
But much like the package of bills Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Saturday meant to keep immigration enforcement agents out of schools and hospitals, it’s unclear what California law enforcement can actually do to enforce the law keeping agents out of courthouses. 
An ICE spokesperson says agents have every right to arrest “a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Colleges and universities across California are about to feel the consequences of steep federal cuts to diversity programs, CalMatters’ Adam Echelman reports. 
The cuts come after the U.S. Department of Education said earlier this month that it was ending a grant program that supports “minority-serving institutions,” claiming that it illegally favors certain racial or ethnic groups.
That’s going to mean California schools will lose access to higher-education funding for tutoring, academic counseling and other support services aimed at helping Black, Latino, Asian and Native American students.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed Senate Bill 627, which would prohibit federal officers from wearing masks during their operations, but any critics of ICE tactics are wildly mistaken if they believe federal officers can be prosecuted for wearing masks.
The controversial tactics agents use to round up undocumented immigrants in Southern California are merely an expansion of the discriminatory stops and interrogations border communities have experienced for generations, writes commentary contributor Pedro Rios.

(Screenshot from video)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita sent a six-page memo to all Indiana school superintendents and university administrators Monday night saying that schools are “wrong” for not disciplining or firing teachers who make comments about Charlie Kirk’s death.
“Some schools have responded to those calls for action with excuses and equivocation, claiming that the First Amendment prevents them from terminating or disciplining educators for celebrating or expressing controversial views about the killing of Charlie Kirk,” Rokita wrote. “In many if not most cases, those schools are wrong.”
He said additionally that, as a legal matter, schools have substantial authority to punish educators for divisive or controversial speech. The memo quotes numerous cases that are standing legal precedent on the matter.
“As a matter of good government and sound public policy, schools would be wise to remove from the classroom teachers who express support for or attempt to excuse political violence. And as a matter of morality, this moment demands decisive action from public officials to address noxious speech from government employees that undermines public confidence in our schools and corrodes public discourse.”
First Amendment and Teacher Speech
 
Since Kirk’s Sept. 10 assassination, Republicans have sought to punish those who “celebrated” the assassination. In Indiana, Gov. Mike Braun has threatened teaching licenses, arguing that “calls for political violence are not freedom of speech and should not be tolerated.”
Pushback against a Ball State University employee led to her firing and she filed suit against the university Monday. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana is seeking an injunction on her behalf.
“Government employees don’t give up their First Amendment rights just to become employees of the government,” said Stevie Pactor, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. “They, still, are entitled to their own personal opinions that they are free to express online or in other forums, so long as those are being made in their personal capacity.”
In Rokita’s document, his office provides a legal analysis about social media posts made by a U.S. history teacher at a high school in north central Indiana. He didn’t name Brett Maurer in the memo, but Rokita posted to social media about the teacher on Sept. 18 and urged Hoosiers to call or email the South Bend district to voice concerns.
In one post, the teacher wrote, “with all due disrespect Charlie Kirk can suck it. He became exactly what he said was ok and acceptable in order to have gun rights. I call that manifestation. I’m not saying it’s right, but I’m saying it’s only fitting.”
There were two other posts by the same teacher, as well, and Rokita said his office received 25 complaints.
The attorney general conceded that because the posts were made on the teacher’s personal social media page and concern a political figure and political topics, it is likely that a court would conclude that the teacher was “sp[eaking] as a citizen on a matter of public concern. Accordingly, whether the high school can discipline or terminate this teacher will depend on a balancing of the school’s interests as an employer and the teacher’s speech interest. An assessment of the posts and the context in which they were made shows clearly that this high school could legally terminate this teacher.”
Rokita alleges the posts were crass and vulgar, which weakens First Amendment protections.

“And there are very clear indications that the teacher’s posts and others like it have sparked severe backlash in Indiana communities that threaten to disrupt school operations …,” he wrote. “The backlash has evidently been so severe that the high school in this case felt impelled to release a public statement justifying its decision not to discipline the teacher, which it justified on the incorrect grounds that it could not terminate the teacher because of the First Amendment.”
Rokita further stated it’s reasonable that allowing divisive and cruel comments to stand creates concerns for parents about whether the teacher can be trusted.
“That loss of trust by the school, if left unaddressed, could have serious negative implications for the school for years to come and is reason enough to take action against the teacher,” he continued.
The memo concluded by saying the speech by Maurer “plainly caused disruption to school operations and is likely to cause further disruption in the days and weeks ahead. The school would thus be well within its authority to terminate the teacher, as would many schools if they chose to terminate teachers who have similarly contributed to the divisive and, for many, painful eruption of controversial discourse on social media and elsewhere concerning Charlie Kirk.”

A California law bans immigration enforcement at courthouses. ICE under the Trump administration is detaining people there, anyway, arguing it’s s safe place to apprehend someone.


Jennifer isn’t saying her brother is a saint. Far from it. He was convicted of domestic violence last year and entered a one-year intervention program. He graduated July 23 in a Fresno county courtroom where a judge told him he had done a good job.
Minutes later, while leaving the courthouse, five men and one woman in plain clothes approached him. 
“Someone came up to him, got in his face and said his name,” said Jennifer, who did not want CalMatters to use her last name because she was concerned about immigration enforcement agents targeting other relatives. “And they grabbed him, and I tried to get between them.”
Her brother, who is undocumented, didn’t provide them with an identification. 
“They shoved him in this car, which was a plain, beat-up van,” Jennifer said. “Then one of them asked if they should wait for ‘the other guy,’ and a different person said ‘we’re good with this one,’ like he was just part of their quota that day.”
Her brother is already back in Mexico. 
Social media is awash with videos of federal agents making arrests at immigration court hearings, which are on federal property, inside federal courthouses. 
What’s different about the detention of Jennifer’s brother is that it took place on the grounds of a state courthouse. Local media have reported the detention of at least two dozen other people on the grounds of California court buildings in Stanislaus, Glenn, Los Angeles and Fresno counties, and NPR reports federal immigration detentions in state courthouses across the country, from the Chicago suburbs to a county south of Boston. 
During the last Trump administration, California Democrats were so concerned about ICE making arrests at superior court buildings and potentially discouraging witnesses from testifying that they passed a law to forbid that kind of enforcement.
Picking people up at a courthouse can have a “potential chilling effect” on witnesses, victims and even suspects who are afraid to show up for court, California Supreme Court Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero said earlier this summer. 
“Making courthouses a focus of immigration enforcement hinders, rather than helps, the administration of justice by deterring witnesses and victims from coming forward and discouraging individuals from asserting their rights,” Guerrero said. 
By waiting outside the courthouse, immigration agents appear to be complying with California law, though it’s unclear whether the word “courthouse” in the law includes the grounds outside the courthouse. Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office wouldn’t provide what it a spokesperson called “legal analysis” of those actions when CalMatters asked about them.
But at least one immigration enforcement action was a clear violation of state law. 
In Butte County, immigration enforcement agents conducted an operation inside the county’s Oroville courthouse on July 28. State law forbids civil arrests “in a courthouse while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”
“As far as the court is aware, ICE had not conducted enforcement actions inside one of its courthouses prior to Monday, July 28th,” Butte County Superior Court executive officer Sharif Elmallah said in a statement.
“The court is concerned by the potential chilling effect and other potential adverse impacts on participation in the legal system that may occur due to these enforcement actions being conducted in and around courthouses.”
As with the package of bills Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Saturday meant to keep immigration enforcement agents out of schools and hospitals, it’s unclear what California law enforcement can actually do to enforce the law forbidding immigration agents from making arrests inside courthouses. 
The state Justice Department’s guidance to state courthouses provides some latitude to immigration enforcement agents. They may make arrests inside a courthouse if the case involves a national security threat, someone’s life is in danger, evidence is in danger or agents are in “hot pursuit.” 
Failing all of that, under California law, immigration agents can enter a courthouse to detain someone whom they believe poses a danger to public safety if they can’t find an alternate location and they have the approval of a federal immigration enforcement supervisor. 
ICE defends courthouse arrests
Jennifer believes immigration agents ran her brother’s name through their own database when it was posted on the Fresno County Superior Court’s public online court docket, then waited for him to appear.
In response to questions from CalMatters, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded with a July quote from a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson which asserted the agency’s right to make arrests of “a lawbreaker where you find them.” The spokesperson also said the arrests are safer for immigration agents, since the people they’re arresting have been through security. 
Policies on courthouse arrests have seesawed through Democratic and Republican administrations.
The Obama administration in 2011 designated schools, hospitals and religious buildings as “sensitive locations” where immigration agents need permission to operate. ICE at the time said the list of sensitive locations was longer than those three types of places and urged agents to get permission from higher-ups before making arrests at any organization assisting “victims of crime.”
Trump undid that policy in 2018 with a directive instructing ICE agents to make arrests at state and local courthouses. They proceeded to do so, even in California. In 2021, the Biden administration reversed that guidance, putting courthouses mostly off-limits.In May, Wired reported that the new Trump administration went even further than its 2018 directive, explicitly removing instructions to agents that they should respect local laws that would prevent them from arresting people. 
Are immigrants avoiding court?
Jennifer said word has already gotten out among the immigrant community in Fresno to stop attending court. Family members even tried to discourage her brother from appearing on the day he was detained.
“In general, people are just avoiding going to the courthouse, even after meeting with groups who inform them that there’s consequences to not showing up,” said Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, a program manager for the Valley Watch Network, an immigrant rights group.
A Fresno County Superior Court spokesperson said the court hasn’t seen a change in the number of people appearing, but noted that in a county of 1 million people, such shifts among a relatively small population would be hard to notice.
The state Department of Justice said it’s aware of the courthouse arrests. As a former member of the Assembly, Bonta, now the state attorney general, was a co-author of the law that was meant to deter immigration enforcement at California courthouses.
“We are very concerned with the Trump administration’s actions, which make our communities less safe by deterring victims or witnesses of crimes from coming forward out of fear of getting caught up in the President’s mass deportation dragnet,” the California Department of Justice said in an unsigned statement to CalMatters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091825_Fresno-Courthouse_LV_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Then just 15 years old, the San Diegan was apparently handcuffed on the streets of the Nestor border community, wrongly and racially profiled. 
Ramirez recalled the incident in a Facebook post recently after the Supreme Court broke with lower courts in a major immigration enforcement ruling stemming from this summer’s raids in Los Angeles. In a 6-3 decision, the highest court of the land gave federal immigration agents the green light to resume roving patrols as a means to indiscriminately stop and question people about their immigration status — based on how they look, the language they speak, the type of work they do or simply where they might be standing.
For Ramirez, now the political director for SEIU United Service Workers West, this is not new. He told me that the Border Patrol, the federal agency with a 101-year history of border enforcement, has always operated with impunity. Racial profiling “has always been the norm in the borderlands.”
Now the rest of California is getting the same treatment.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion rationalized profiling to an eye-opening level, writing that “those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction” and many “do not speak much English.”
Since a Kern County raid in January, videos of masked federal agents chasing predominantly Latino workers at Home Depots, car washes or parks — without regard for legal status or criminal history — have filled social media feeds across California. But for Justice Kavanaugh, “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.”
Kavanaugh’s wishful thinking or privileged ignorance would have you believe the encounters are mere inconveniences. On the contrary, they have been quite catastrophic.

Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old father of two, represents the latest casualty. Earlier this month in Chicago, an ICE agent shot and killed Villegas-Gonzalez during a traffic stop. In Ventura County in July, Jaime Alanís died from injuries he sustained in an attempt to flee agents raiding a legal pot farm.
What Ramirez experienced as a child — and countless others in southern San Diego County — is certainly not unique. The difference now is that it’s occurring far from the border.
Together with the American Friends Service Committee and Union del Barrio, I helped document roving patrols in San Diego for nearly a decade in the 2000s. Border Patrol agents surveilled buses and the San Diego trolley, harassing thousands of people based on appearance or if they spoke Spanish, and targeted working-class neighborhoods during busy commute times. We discovered that anyone could be a target, even if they’re seeking shelter during a natural disaster or taking transit to get to school.
In 2003, Border Patrol Sector Chief William Veal issued a memo ending roving patrols but was quickly overruled by Robert Bonner, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, who called it “overly broad and restrictive.”
When President Obama refreshed the federal policy restricting federal agencies from using racial profiling in 2014, his administration excluded CBP agents who could “consider race and ethnicity when stopping people at airports, border crossings and immigration checkpoints.”
At the height of California’s anti-immigrant movement in 1994, Border Patrol agents on bikes stopped me in Downtown San Diego and questioned me about my status. They insisted in broken Spanish that I had to show them my “papers.”
About 20 years ago, a plainclothes immigration agent detained my father outside a grocery store a block from his home in South San Diego. The agent similarly asked him if he had papers. 
My father always carried an old government ID issued to U.S. citizens to facilitate border crossings. The immigration agent didn’t know what to make of the antiquated document.
Racial profiling and its impact on my family goes back to the 1930s, when immigration agents violently rounded up and forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people in violation of the U.S. Constitution, including U.S. citizens. Immigration agents sent my paternal grandparents to Mexico, even though they were born in Los Angeles.
Donald Trump’s radical vision for mass deportations has glamorized the cruelty of this historic period. He wants to surpass those numbers.

Norma Chavez-Peterson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties, was a co-counsel on a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security after the L.A. raids unfolded in June. In an email, she told me the Supreme Court’s decision “emboldens the Trump administration and enables their broader power grab to weaken the constitutional protections of all people. 
“Right now, the decision directly impacts immigrants and people of color in Los Angeles and surrounding regions — and it won’t stop there,” she continued. “When one person’s rights are stripped away, the thread that binds all our freedoms begins to fray.”
With the Supreme Court sanctioning racial profiling in how immigration agents can indiscriminately question people, the newly supercharged Homeland Security budget could lead to thousands more agents being unleashed on American streets, and disastrous for our understanding of how constitutional protections should apply.
In San Diego, elected officials held a press conference announcing a county-wide initiative to promote due process and public safety across San Diego County. 
“The Due Process and Dignity Ordinance,” said San Diego City Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera, “responds by drawing clear, lawful boundaries around what can and cannot happen on city-controlled and funded property. It demands that everyone in San Diego — including those who were made less safe by the SCOTUS decision — is afforded due process and, in doing so, also provides all people the firmest ground possible to assert their constitutional rights.”
Ramirez, the SEIU official, believes “it’s going to take creating a movement beyond the halls of justice and legislative bodies to overturn racism codified by the Supreme Court.”  
He reminded me of a slogan borrowed from Puerto Rican students resisting U.S. troops in Vieques. It’s now used by community members in San Diego to demonstrate power: “La migra no se fue, el pueblo la sacó, and it will take all of us.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725_Christian-Ramirez_AH_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

California’s legal weed industry is still overshadowed by the larger black market. A new state law gives businesses a break by delaying a tax increase.



Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a bill to roll back taxes on recreational weed in an effort to give some relief to an industry that has struggled to supersede its illicit counterpart since voters legalized marijuana almost 10 years ago.
The law will temporarily revert the cannabis excise tax to 15% until 2028, suspending an increase to 19% levied earlier this year. The law is meant to help dispensaries that proponents say are operating under slim margins due to being bogged down by years of overregulation.
“We’re rolling back this cannabis tax hike so the legal market can continue to grow, consumers can access safe products, and our local communities see the benefits,” Newsom said in a statement, and that reducing the tax will allow legal businesses to remain competitive and boost their long-term growth.
An excise tax is a levy imposed by the state before sales taxes are applied. It’s applied to the cannabis industry under a 2022 agreement between the state and marijuana companies. It replaced a different kind of fee that was supposed to raise revenue for social programs, such as child care assistance, in accordance with the 2016 ballot measure that legalized cannabis.
For years, the cannabis industry has lobbied against the tax, arguing that it hurts an industry overshadowed by a thriving illicit drug market.
“By stopping this misguided tax hike, the governor and Legislature chose smart policy that grows revenue by keeping the legal market viable instead of driving consumers back to dangerous, untested illicit products,” Amy O’Gorman, executive director of the California Cannabis Operators Association, said in a statement.
Since its legalization, the recreational weed industry has struggled to outpace the illegal market as farmers flooded the industry and prices began to drop. Taxable cannabis sales have slowly declined since their peak in the second quarter of 2021 of more than $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion four years later, according to data from the state Department of Tax and Fee Administration. Legal sales make up about 40% of all weed consumption, according to the state Department of Cannabis Control.
Several nonprofits that receive grants through the tax opposed the bill, arguing that it will threaten services for low-income children, substance abuse programs and environmental protections.
In the Emerald Triangle, where the heartland of the industry lies nestled in the northern corner of the state, conservation organizations said they were disappointed in the governor and that it was a step backwards for addressing environmental degradation caused by illegal growers in years past. 
“All this bill does is reduce the resources we have to remedy the harms of the illegal market,” said Alicia Hamann, executive director of Friends of the Eel River in Humboldt County.
Many nonprofits supported spiking other fees in agreement with lawmakers and industry groups that the excise tax would be increased three years later, Hamann said.
“It feels a little bit like a stab in the back,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/050820-Cannabis-Marijuana-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Rooney and Brooke Thomson",,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/trump-administration-assault-on-offshore-wind-is-bad-for-business-and-our-economy/,"Offshore wind can deliver critical energy needs while supporting the region’s economic growth and job creation. These moves by the administration send a troubling signal to employers: after years of planning, layers of government oversight, and finalized permits that survived court scrutiny – suddenly, there is a government reversal.","WE WORK WITH the region’s companies, institutions, and small businesses every day, and we consistently hear about the frustrations and concerns of leading a business in New England as energy costs continue to rise. Our New England employers pay some of the highest costs in the nation to heat and run their facilities, and residents struggle with rising costs throughout the year.  
Despite these challenging energy circumstances, employers remain committed to creating meaningful jobs, spurring economic growth for the region and economic mobility in the workforce.  
For example, the business community stepped forward to champion two new sources of electricity in New England from offshore wind when the region needs it most. However, many of these projects have been put in serious jeopardy, including Revolution Wind off the Rhode Island coast, due to federal stop work orders that place innovation, competition, and job creation at a standstill. While we are pleased that Revolution Wind can resume construction, putting thousands back to work, after a US District Court judge in Washington on Monday granted a request for temporary injunction against the Trump administration move, we remain concerned about the onslaught of work stop orders.  
With these stop work orders, the success of our workers, families, businesses, and economy is at risk. The Department of the Interior should reconsider the stop work orders for these offshore energy facilities. There is a detrimental ripple effect that stops the billions of dollars in private investment, opportunities for thousands of workers across a multi-state supply chain, and valuable infrastructure improvements on our working waterfronts.  
Offshore wind can deliver critical energy needs while supporting the region’s economic growth and job creation. The fixed-price predictability of wind energy from Vineyard Wind, for example, is expected to save electric consumers $1.4 billion over the first 20 years of operation. The electric grid operator for New England, ISO-NE, responded to the Revolution Wind stop work order by warning about risks to grid reliability. “Beyond near-term impacts to reliability in the summer and winter peak periods, delays in the availability of new resources will adversely affect New England’s economy and industrial growth, including potential future data centers,” ISO-NE said.  
These moves by the administration send a troubling signal to employers: after years of planning, layers of government oversight, and finalized permits that survived court scrutiny – suddenly, there is a government reversal.  
Businesses want and need to trust federal policymakers and government leaders, and employers depend on that trust and certainty to make strategic investments and hiring decisions. A stop work order can paralyze a company that would otherwise be contributing significantly to the region’s economy. How can companies successfully grow our economy, hire thousands of people, and compete if they are abruptly stopped by the federal government?  
This is not only about the future electricity demand of our region, but also about the future of energy in our country. Our nation’s energy strategy should encourage innovation, investments, and a diverse mix of resources that will power New England’s growth and the country’s competitive edge.  
While offshore wind is just one part of our energy portfolio, the use of natural gas, new nuclear power, and other renewable technologies will promote long-term economic growth and provide opportunities for all residents and businesses. Attacking a new source of energy that is only months away from or already supplying power to the region will only increase electricity prices further, further dampening the state’s economy. Let’s not place additional obstacles on technologies we need to grow the economy now and in the future.

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco on Monday gave both parties in a State Senate redistricting case two options to give voters a remedial map. (Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A federal judge Monday laid out a contingent plan to implement a previous ruling that the Alabama State Senate map violated the Voting Rights Act.
The steps came after attorneys for Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, the defendant in the lawsuit, told U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco Monday that no decision had been made about calling a special session of the Legislature to redraw two Montgomery state senate districts Manasco ruled were in violation of the Voting Rights Act. 
“It’s our understanding, they continue to talk about this. They continue to be looking at the issues, trying to make a decision. They have not done so,” Assistant Attorney General Jim Davis told Manasco.

Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, said Monday that if the Legislature does not adopt a remedial map in a special session, she will appoint the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023: Richard Allen as the special master, David Ely as his cartographer, and Michael Scodro and his law firm, Mayer Brown LLP, as the special master’s legal counsel. 
Neither Allen nor the plaintiffs objected to the appointment. 
Davis said Monday that Oct. 1 would be the latest Ivey could call a special session to have a map adopted by Oct. 10. Manasco said she wants to put the special master to work on a contingent basis between Oct. 1 and 10 in order for a map to be fully implemented by Nov. 17. The roughly five weeks between would allow the plaintiffs and Allen to argue over the remedial map, Manasco said.
“I’m not inclined to say anything more at this time about what the Legislature would need to do to pass a remedial map, because I think the court’s previous order speaks for itself,” Manasco said. 
If the special master draws the map and the Legislature does not meet, the cost of the special master would fall to the plaintiffs, Manasco said. The court could not pay the fee, and Davis said the state could not pay the fee if the map was not drawn for the use of the Legislature in a special session. 
Davin Rosborough, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the plaintiffs, said he expects the plaintiffs to be open to paying the fee. The special master billed the state $515,000 for the map he drew for the state’s congressional districts in 2023. 
“My inclination is to recommend that we proceed in that way, so long as there’s sufficient clarity in what the circumstances would be in which the plaintiffs would be responsible for the costs,” Rosborough said. 
Davis said he would research the legality of the state sharing the cost before Oct. 1. 
Manasco ruled in August that the Montgomery area needed a second majority-minority district, or something close to it, to give Black voters an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing. 
Should the ruling be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, eventually resulting in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.   
Allen has appealed the ruling citing that a similar case in Louisiana, Callais v. Louisiana, may not require such districts. 
“I have no idea what we are going to know, whether it’s more than we know today or the same things we know today, about what’s going to happen in Callais by that day,” Manasco said. “Many of these factors are beyond the control of not only this court, but everybody in the room.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AR-Election-Day-Huntsville-110524-13-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Construction jobs are off 6.9% statewide for the year, according to David Schmidt, chief economist for DETR.  The top […]","The top three occupations filing unemployment claims in August, “without a doubt, were construction laborers, carpenters and electricians – the sorts of jobs that we see with home construction,” said an economist that tracks employment data for the state. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A precipitous decline in new home sales in Southern Nevada is contributing, experts say, to a loss of construction jobs, which fell statewide by 4,400 in August, according to the Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation. Construction jobs are off 6.9% statewide for the year, according to David Schmidt, chief economist for DETR. 
The top three occupations filing unemployment claims in August, “without a doubt, were construction laborers, carpenters and electricians – the sorts of jobs that we see with home construction,” said Schmidt in an interview Monday. “As we’ve seen this slowdown in the housing market, I do think that is being reflected in both our unemployment claims data and the slides we’ve seen in construction employment so far this year.”
Nevada construction “contributed $20 billion (7.8%) of the state’s GDP of $260 billion” in 2024, reports the Associated General Contractors of America. That’s the second-highest rate in the nation behind Utah (8.5%), according to QI Research. 
The U.S. lost 7,000 construction jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, meaning Nevada accounts for almost two-thirds. 
Driven by falling construction employment, Nevada lost 3,800 jobs in August

But Schmidt warns against placing value on initial reports, given that federal “monthly numbers get revised several times, because there’s a lot of uncertainty in the data.” The government’s margin of error, or “confidence interval,” projects the actual national number could go up or down by about 25,000 jobs.  
“It’s horrible,” Patricia Farley, owner of Southwest Specialties, a high-end contractor that installs pavers and other hardscapes, says of the lull in home construction. In busier times, Farley says her company worked on 35 to 45 homes per week. That dropped to 22 to 30 a week in the two years following COVID. In August, jobs plunged to 10 to 15 a week. 
“Homebuilders and subs are laying off,” she says, adding homeowners are not remodeling and commercial properties are not making tenant improvements. 
In January, homebuilders in Southern Nevada sold 974 homes. That’s steadily declined to 653 homes sold in August, according to data from Home Builders’ Research. 
Standing inventory of finished homes stood at 688 for the first week in September. 
“If a builder has $300,000 sunk in a home and they have 100 homes sitting in standing inventory, they have $30 million just sitting,” Farley said. “They pay interest on those homes every month, as well.” 
Farley contends new and existing homes are overpriced – a factor she says overshadows high interest rates. “If a $250,000 house is selling for $450,000, it doesn’t matter what the interest rates are.” 
New homes, she says, are shrinking in size while doubling in price. 
Lennar Homes, the second largest builder in the U.S., saw net earnings for June, July, and August fall from just under $1.2 billion last year to $591 million this year, an almost 50% drop. The builder is slashing prices by 22%, resulting in a spike in new orders.  
“New home builders want nothing more than to sell, build and deliver as many homes as they can for Nevadans,” says Tina Frias, CEO of the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association. 
Builders, she says, “continue to be creative in developing product across a range of price points, but their ability to reduce costs is difficult when considering the price of land, labor and materials.” 
Frias says there’s “no question that broader economic conditions, consumer confidence and the interest rate environment are contributing to the performance within the housing market. Sales volumes have slowed from post-pandemic highs when mortgage interest rates were low, but pricing has remained relatively stable – both in the new home and resale segments of the market.”
Las Vegas real estate agent Diane Varney agrees that prices of existing homes have fallen and remained stable for much of the last year. But seller expectations remain high, resulting in overpriced properties, at least on paper, where seller concessions for repairs, interest buydowns and more are not apparent.  
A glut of existing homes for sales in Southern Nevada has “flattened out a little bit,” says Varney 
“We had 5,500 homes for sale on the Multiple Listing Service in January. Now we’re close to 8,000, but it flattened out a little bit in August to mid-September. We didn’t see the inventory climbing by 100 homes a week like we were.” 
The median price of an existing home has held steady around $480,000 for much of the past year. 
Nationally, 25% of home sales are falling out of escrow, according to Varney, who says in Southern Nevada, the number is between 15% and 18%. Homes that are on the market for 50 to 60 days, she says, have a 30% chance of selling, according to tracking data. Buyers, exposed to a plethora of homes for sale, “don’t want a project. They want a turnkey home.” 
As for what to expect from the economy, Schmidt of DETR says he “doesn’t see a pullback,” adding wages and hours remain strong, which he says indicates an interest among employers to hire, despite uncertainty.  
“We’re just kind of flat,” he observes. “We’re kind of waiting to see where things will be going over the next six months.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2229115499-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Gavin Newsom signed a series of bills aimed at protecting California’s undocumented immigrants from aggressive raids by President Donald Trump’s immigration agents.
Senate Bill 627, which would prohibit federal officers from wearing masks during their operations, drew the heaviest media coverage and a dismissive response from administration officials.
“What are you afraid of?” Newsom asked of federal agents during the signing event in Los Angeles. “You’re going to go out and you’re going to do enforcement — provide an ID. Tell us which agency you represent. Provide us basic information that all local law enforcement is required to provide.”
“We don’t need to abide by this garbage,” Tricia McLaughlin, deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, posted on X.
The political saber rattling is merely theatrical symbolism. Newsom got another fix of national media attention to bolster his image as resistor-in-chief to the commander-in-chief, in apparent preparation for a 2028 presidential campaign.
By denouncing Newsom and the legislation, Trump administration officials reassured his political base he’s serious about cracking down on those who entered the country illegally.
Newsom and any other critics of ICE tactics are delusional if they believe federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted for wearing masks after SB 627 takes effect. State and local authorities have no power to arrest federal officers for official actions, no matter how questionable they may be, which was made clear by a U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a U.S. marshal fatally shooting a former California Supreme Court justice in 1889 and a 1972 shooting death of a suspected drug dealer in Humboldt County.
In 1859, former California Supreme Court Justice David Terry got into an argument with U.S. Sen. David Broderick over slavery and the two erstwhile friends settled it with a duel in San Francisco that left Broderick dead. Historians considered it the nation’s last noteworthy duel before the practice was outlawed.
Thirty years later, Terry was involved in another feud, this time with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field and he made several threats on Field’s life. U.S. Marshal David Neagle was Field’s bodyguard as he toured the state, holding court in various communities. Terry confronted Field in a train station in Lathrop, near Stockton, and struck Field several times before Neagle fatally shot Terry.
The San Joaquin County sheriff arrested Neagle for homicide, but federal judges ordered his release. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared that a federal officer cannot be prosecuted by state or local authorities while acting in the course of official duties.
That principle was tested again in California after Dirk Dickenson, a suspected drug dealer, was shot in the back by federal drug agent Lloyd Clifton during a raid on Dickenson’s rural Humboldt County home in 1972.
I played a minor role in the ensuing legal case because I was editor of the Humboldt Times-Standard at the time. One of my reporters accompanied officers on the raid and was an eyewitness to the shooting.
Some historians consider Dickenson to be the first casualty of the federal war on drugs. In an affidavit Clifton said, “At the time I thought it was necessary to prevent Dickenson from escaping.”
Local outrage at Dickenson’s death resulted in a grand jury murder indictment of Clifton, but before he could be tried, a federal judge blocked the proceedings based on the 19th century Supreme Court decision involving Marshal Neagle. A federal appellate court later agreed.
That’s why, no matter how much Californians might resent the ICE raids, state and local officials cannot tell federal agents not to wear masks.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060625_ICE-Raid-DTLA_JWBH_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Kay Ivey and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter added a new plaintiff last week to a lawsuit against the Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) over transfer student-athlete eligibility.
The officials sued the AHSAA earlier this month, alleging that the AHSAA’s policy of requiring CHOOSE Act recipients to forgo a year of athletic eligibility violated the law. 
The plaintiff, Jaclyn Hall, filed on behalf of herself and her son, known as Z.H.2 in the complaint. The complaint alleges that the child cannot participate in his school’s football program due to receiving CHOOSE Act funds.

“[Z.H.2] trained with the team over the summer before being informed that the AHSAA deemed him ineligible to play this school year due to his participation in the CHOOSE Act,” the complaint said.
The CHOOSE Act allows qualifying families to claim up to $7,000 a year in tax credits for “noneducation expenses,” including private school tuition. AHSAA considered it a form of financial aid, and said the regulation was required to ensure fairness. 
A message seeking comment was left with the AHSAA Monday. 
In addition to the complaint, Ivey and Ledbetter also filed a motion for preliminary injunction to replace the temporary restraining order they were granted on Sept. 5.
“Plaintiffs recently have become aware of two AHSAA rules that severely undermine the court’s September 5, 2025 order,” the motion said. “These rules, called the ‘school restitution rule’ and the ‘student restitution rule,” penalize schools and students if a student whom the AHSAA deems ineligible participates in an AHSAA-sanctioned athletic event even if the student was participating at that time pursuant to a valid court order.” 
The school and student restitution rules are listed in AHSAA’s handbook and penalize any student who participates in athletics for an amount of time equal to the amount of time they played while ineligible. Schools that allow ineligible students to participate could be fined if a court order that allows the students to compete is lifted for any reason.
The motion for injunction also alleges that last December AHSAA threatened a student at Marbury High School with suspension for the first three games of the 2025 football season for playing while ineligible.
“According to this court, the AHSAA made that threat even though the student had played pursuant to the court’s order directing the AHSAA to ‘immediately grant [him] eligibility in all varsity sports,’” the motion said.
Ivey said in a press release Friday that AHSAA’s decision to penalize CHOOSE Act students and schools is disheartening.
“I remain steadfast in support of the CHOOSE Act and its promise of true school choice, even when it comes to participation in athletics,” the statement said. “I look forward to the court righting this wrong as soon as possible.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

(Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)After weeks of hype, it turns out the Oklahoma Department of Education’s new test that promises to weed out “woke” teachers doesn’t do any such thing.
In fact, it’s impossible to fail Superintendent Ryan Walters’ so-called “America First” test that he promises is “woke-proofing the classroom” and that he wants to require blue-state educators to take before they can teach here.
It turns out you can get every answer wrong and still receive a “Certificate of Completion” certifying that you have “successfully completed the Teacher Qualification Test.” I know because I purposely set out to get every question wrong by picking the stupidest answers in the 34-question multiple choice exam developed in conjunction with PragerU, a self-described conservative nonprofit, that includes a mix of random history, culture and gender-related biology questions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The test, which is available to anyone to take, requires you to keep guessing until you pick the correct answer. As a result, there’s no true measure of if someone is too “woke” to teach in our schools or even if they actually understand our nation’s history.
I had been looking forward to pitting myself against the test to get a better grasp about how Walters and PragerU actually define “woke.” Walters, after all, is encouraging schools to use PragerU’s videos as instructional materials in our schools.
So I was disappointed, though perhaps not entirely surprised, to discover after weeks of promises, this test amounts to the latest harebrained antic dreamed up by a headline-thirsty public official.
The effort does little more than fearmonger against imaginary boogeyteachers who Walters seems to think want to consume Oklahoma children’s little souls with “liberal” lessons.
But this stunt is the biggest embarrassment yet for our Republican state superintendent, and that’s saying a lot given that he has proven time and again to be all show and little substance. He’s already created the do-nothing Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism and once tried to require a video of himself attacking the “radical left” be shown to children.
I fear this latest effort will do little to help our state attract the quality teachers we desperately need and to bolster faith in the lessons being taught in our classrooms. We’re in the throes of a massive teacher shortage and have seen record numbers of emergency certified educators entering our classrooms. We’re behind the regional average in educator pay, and though Walters has implemented successful signing bonus programs aimed at helping recruit talented teachers, it hasn’t been enough to turn the tide.
Because it wasn’t the actual test questions themselves that were so insulting, though it is pretty bold to require an assessment that doesn’t actually do any assessing and to pass it off as a barometer to prove “your commitment to truth and integrity.”
What I found alarming was Walters’ seeming reckless disregard for protecting personal information. In order to take this dubious “assessment,” people are required to visit PragerU’s site and provide the California-based nonprofit with all sorts of personal information.
Why does PragerU need to know my mailing address, my phone number, my name, my email address and if I’m a parent or teacher in order to access this.
What’s next, a DNA sample?
And I also had to agree to give PragerU carte blanc permission to send me emails and “view, monitor and record” my activity on their site. And they have wasted no time in spamming me with unwanted emails like a sandwich shop rewards program.
We’re supposed to be able to trust Walters to act in the best interest of our children, and I fail to see how shilling for PragerU does that.
What I also found outrageous was the bizarre, 16-minute video conversation that Walters recorded with PragerU’s CEO Marissa Streit that introduces the test. The CEO lets loose and says the people who are critical of her group “are the same people who don’t care about children,” and “people who have been able to hold schools and our children hostage to their political agenda.”
She also said their group and Walters have the “same enemies.”
Rather than pushing back on that “woke” indoctrination and insulting inflammatory rhetoric, Walters responds: “That’s exactly right.”
“We’re not going to continue to sit back and watch the teacher’s unions use schools to force a left-wing ideology on kids,” Walters also says in the video.
Talk about a political agenda.
Anyone who registers to complete the test receives a welcome email from PragerU containing this gem: “Alarmingly, many young Americans haven’t been exposed to clear, conservative perspectives. PragerU fills that void by offering fact-based content that simplifies complex issues and champions foundational values like freedom and personal responsibility.”
Not surprisingly “conservative” indoctrination is OK in Walters’ eyes.
As a parent, I don’t want any sort of indoctrination going on in my schools.
And, to borrow one of Republicans’ favorite phrases, shouldn’t I have parental choice in terms of what my children are learning? Why would I want some random California nonprofit determining what’s right for my children or spouting hate about me – their mother – being an “enemy” simply because I’m a critic of PragerU’s efforts to oversimply our history and make fun of historically marginalized people?
As a particularly revolting example, PragerU has a cartoon on their site that features two time traveling children who go back to 1493 to speak with Christopher Columbus. They’re on a mission to determine whether the U.S. should honor him with a holiday or if that day should honor the Indigenous people of the Americas who lived here when he arrived. When asked about slavery, Columbus justifies it by saying it’s as old as time, and that “being taken as a slave is better than being killed.”
Wow.
Does saying slavery is wrong make someone “woke”? I’m not sure. But teaching children that it’s a better option than death is callous. And immoral.
Walters said he’s fine with allowing his children to learn from PragerU videos, and that’s a choice he gets to make. He’s in a position of power, even if he’s using it irresponsibly.
But if Walters truly embodies parental empowerment like he claims, he should not be associating in an official capacity with a group that is trying to assert their political beliefs in our schools.
Walters should be pushing back against all out-of-state actors, even conservative ones, who are trying to impose their views on our children. And he shouldn’t be allowing random groups to create “tests.”
Let’s leave that to the education experts.

We’re not working for our philosophies. And we’re not working for our political parties.” Matt Vasilogambros/StatelineThis article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access.
How much a poll worker earns in Michigan depends less on what they do and more on where they do it.
Across the state, pay for election inspectors — the workers who check in voters and keep precincts running — can range from less than $175 a day to more than $300. That means two people doing the same job just a few miles apart might take home dramatically different paychecks.
State law only requires that election officials “receive reasonable compensation,” leaving the exact amount up to local officials. But for poll workers, where they choose to do the job is almost entirely up to them.
Votebeat surveyed more than 60 communities to see what clerks offer their poll workers. The results show wide gaps not only in pay but also in benefits, from free meals to same-day paychecks — and reveal how those differences shape the pool of workers each community can attract and keep.
Clerks told Votebeat that wide pay disparities make recruiting poll workers harder. They’re not only competing with hourly jobs that offer steady pay, but also with neighboring jurisdictions that can afford to pay more. For election officials, who have to find, train, and employ poll workers — typically referred to as “election inspectors” at the base level of training and work — the challenge repeats every season.
 The grass is greener in Detroit

The pay divide is particularly stark in Wayne County, where a 20-minute drive could net a poll worker an additional $100 or more. In Detroit, poll workers start at $300 a day, compared with only $225 in neighboring Dearborn. In Livonia, a little farther west, that drops to $170 (although Lori Miller, Livonia City Clerk, recognizes the discrepancy and is working on boosting that).
Communities in smaller counties benefit from the work itself being less demanding.
Mary Hopkins, city clerk of Grand Blanc in Genesee County, said she recalled a worker choosing to go south to Oakland County. “I will say, they might have made more money, but they probably really had to earn it,” Hopkins said, “because our elections are usually relatively small and peaceful, which isn’t always true in those bigger cities.”
In Grand Blanc, a Flint suburb of 8,000 people, Hopkins starts her poll workers at $200 a day. That covers just over 14 hours of work, she said, because elections are generally small-scale. She can manage most of the prep work for the city’s two precincts, meaning election inspectors are able to show up just before polls open to be sworn in and don’t usually have to stay too late after polls close.
That rate, which works out to more than $14 an hour, is well above Michigan’s $12.48 minimum wage and enough to keep the pool of poll workers Hopkins has — which is largely made up of retirees looking to serve their community — pretty happy.
 The benefits: pizza, potlucks and same-day paychecks

Often, officials told Votebeat, it’s a matter of relying on the people in your community. Poll workers are typically retirees who enjoy socializing and the pride of serving the public. In many places, the same group comes back each election cycle. Most people don’t shop around for a better pay rate, clerks said. Additional perks certainly don’t hurt, though.
The perks take different forms. In Lansing, for instance, Election Supervisor Robin Stites told Votebeat that allowing workers to serve in shifts, rather than all day, has been helpful for both recruitment and retention. Not everyone offers that option — splitting a shift means finding, training, and managing payroll for up to twice as many people — but it is working for Stites.
In Pittsfield Charter Township, near Ann Arbor, Deputy Clerk Jill Mitchell offers election inspectors boxed lunches and snacks such as granola bars or crackers.
In Burton, near Flint, election officials have ordered pizza (including veggie options for the vegetarians) and sandwiches from local restaurants, Joy Roe, deputy clerk, told Votebeat. Some precincts host their own potluck.
It works because precincts tend to be staffed by the same people each election. They know what others like — desserts, veggie trays, duck stew brought by a poll worker who is an avid hunter, Roe said — and are happy to work together to make the day more enjoyable.
“I miss it sometimes,” Roe said. “I was a poll worker for 16 years before this job, and sometimes I want to sneak out, because I know where the good food is.”
David Elwell, clerk of Blackman Charter Township in Jackson County, has won people over by ensuring that they receive their check for the work before they walk out the door. Many communities make poll workers wait several weeks for checks to be processed through the local government payroll.
“I know the workers appreciate that,” he said.
It also helps that in a number of places around the state, officials have reduced the number of precincts they run. State law has recently changed to allow jurisdictions to change the maximum size of precincts from about 3,000 people to about 5,000 people. So for the first time in years, some clerks said, they expect to have more eligible workers than they may need.
 The other benefit: a chance to serve

For poll workers themselves, the benefit typically comes from supporting their community. Anything else is a bonus.
Robert Johncox, a Southfield resident who has served as a poll worker in the city for almost every election since 2018, said he’s never seriously considered leaving his own community because Southfield has a hard enough time finding people already.
“I don’t want to abandon them,” he said with a laugh.
Detroit is just across Eight Mile Road — the city and county line — from Southfield. Johncox could get a significant pay bump if he made the 20-minute drive from his house. As a precinct chairperson, the title for more senior poll workers who work closely with city clerks, he makes $275 in Southfield, compared with $230 for entry-level poll workers. Detroit, meanwhile, pays its base-level poll workers $300. Precinct chairs start at $600.
Johncox doesn’t want to drive, though. And while he certainly wouldn’t say no to free lunches, it’s ultimately the pride of serving his community that keeps him working where he lives.
“I’m retired. I had a good career as an engineer, so I’m really not doing it for the money,” he said. “I’m more there for the helping.”

The Nevada State Public Charter School Authority, the largest authorizers of charter schools in the state and functionally the second largest school district in the state, last month approved two new charter schools for the 2026-27 academic years: Somerset Academy of Carson City and Northern Nevada Wildflower Montessori.
Meanwhile, the City of Henderson approved what is expected to be its first city-sponsored charter school: Kesher Academy, a Hebrew-language immersion school.
The three charter schools plan to enroll 316 students combined when they open next year and scale up to 976 students over six years.
Somerset Academy Inc. is part of the Florida-based Academica network which has more than two dozen schools in the state, primarily in the Las Vegas metro area. Somerset Academy of Carson City will mark the organization’s debut school in the state capital.
Somerset Carson plans to open with 152 students in grades kindergarten through second grade, then scale up to 430 students and grade seven over six years.
Carson City School District, in feedback to the SPCSA, criticized the charter school authorization process, specifically the criteria used within the Academic and Demographic Needs Assessment.
“Needs are already being addressed,” read the district’s feedback. “The number of students considered at-risk of dropping out of school by the state definition is falling. Graduation rates are increasing. Chronic Absenteeism rates are falling.”
Families from other school districts seek inter-district variances for special education students in order to get them into Carson City SD “because our program is so well regarded,” the district continued. “We have the most inclusive and largest GATE program in the state (as % of enrollment)…”
In response to an SCPSA question asking whether any existing schools provide a similar educational model to the proposed charter school, the school district did not mince words: “There is nothing special about the model being proposed.”
The district’s response continued, “Every elementary school we have has a similar mission, goal set and work being done. I would argue that most elementary schools in America do.”
While some students transfer to charter schools from private schools or after being home schooled, charter schools typically draw most of their enrollment from families who otherwise would have sent their children to the traditional public school district they are zoned for.
That means Somerset could bring trouble for Carson City SD, which noted for the SPCSA that it is already “a declining enrollment area due to escalating property values and smaller family sizes.”
The Nevada Appeal reported Carson City SD’s enrollment has dropped below 7,000 students this year.
Official enrollment counts for the current academic year have not yet been released by the Nevada Department of Education, but early tallies reported by Carson City SD to its school board this month found 130 fewer students enrolled than in the previous year.
Schools receive per-pupil dollars from the state, meaning lower enrollment can lead to staff cuts or reduced resources.
Somerset was one of two schools approved by the SPCSA Board to open next year. The second, Northern Nevada Wildflower Montessori, was approved to open in the Reno/Sparks area next year.
It plans to enroll 29 kids in grades kindergarten through third grade to start, then scale up to 171 and sixth grade over six years.
Washoe County School District, in its feedback to the SPCSA, noted it is already “anticipating significant losses to student enrollments” because of Academica’s Mater Academy of Northern Nevada Golden Valley. When that school was approved in late 2024, the district warned it may result in the closure of existing schools in the area.
Earlier this year, the SPCSA overtook Washoe County SD as the second largest local education agency in the state. Enrollment growth within SPCSA has outpaced the district since at least 2016.
When responding to the question about whether the proposed charter school would meet the academic and demographic needs, Washoe County SD noted Wildflower listed an approximately 193-square-mile area that it hopes to serve.
“Because of the large range of academic needs in the identified area, it is unclear if Wildflower would meet the needs of the community,” their response read.
The district also questioned whether the Wildflower is bringing a new educational model to the area, citing the existence of Sierra Nevada Academy Charter School, a charter school sponsored by the district, and High Desert Montessori School, a state-sponsored charter school
Public feedback for Wildflower was largely in support, but at least one person expressed concern that the proposed school would hurt High Desert.
Washoe County SD also noted that the district offers open enrollment, so families have flexibility within the district.
The third new charter school recently approved to open next year will be overseen not by the SPCSA but by the City of Henderson, which opted to take advantage of legislation passed in 2023 that allows them to sponsor their own charter schools.
Kesher Academy, a Hebrew-language immersion school, plans to open with 125 students in grades kindergarten through second. By year six, it plans to enroll 375 students from kindergarten through seventh grade.
No feedback from Clark County School District was included as a part of Kesher’s application materials.
A look ahead to 2027
The SPCSA Board also approved Citizens of the World to open in the 2027-28 academic year. 
Citizens plans to open in east Las Vegas with 150 students in grades kindergarten through second, then scale up to seventh grade and 510 students over six years.
Clark County SD noted in its feedback form that, while the 12 middle and elementary schools in the proposed area are rated 1- or 2-star, only one is over its enrollment capacity.
Charter schools denied
Numerous charter school proposals did not survive this year’s application cycle.
The SPCSA Board denied Pahrump Valley Academy, which was hoping to become the first charter school in Nye County. The board also denied the application last year.
Pathways in Education, a proposed charter school in North Las Vegas, and Purpose Leadership Academy, a proposed charter that wants to focus on Black and Hispanic males, were also denied by the SPCSA Board.
Purpose Leadership Academy has been denied by the SPCSA Board in previous cycles, as well as by the City of Henderson this year.
Meanwhile, the City of North Las Vegas will not become an authorizer of charter schools next year, despite its council expressing clear support for doing so.
Two schools, Nevada Early College and Career Academy and Purpose Leadership Academy, applied with the city in June but were denied after staff determined their applications failed to meet standards set by the city.
Both schools at the time indicated they would resubmit their applications for reconsiderations. Those reconsideration votes came up at North Las Vegas City Council’s Aug. 20 meeting, but the staff recommendation remained to deny.
Councilmembers did not discuss the votes, which were included as part of the consent agenda.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bookclassroom-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Washington’s most competitive legislative contest this fall is shaping up as a referendum on how to change the direction that majority Democrats in the Legislature are steering the state.
And one of the two candidates calling for that change is a Democrat herself. 
Deb Krishnadasan, the state senator campaigning to retain her seat in November, says she is best positioned to influence her caucus colleagues who are passing fiscal policies that are hurting residents.
“I bring a balanced voice to the majority party. That is what we need right now,” she said at a forum this month in the Pierce County hamlet of Vaughn. “We need to bring a voice that will get the majority party to work for our people, to take the word ‘taxes’ off our most vulnerable. We need to change direction.”
Michelle Caldier, the six-term Republican state representative seeking to unseat Krishnadasan, argues the most effective means of redirecting Senate Democrats is by reducing their numbers. Today, Democrats hold a 30-19 advantage, allowing them to push through policies over all GOP objectors.
“Olympia is a mess. The makeup of the Legislature is so bad. The direction that we are going is absolutely ridiculous,” she said at the forum. “We need to change the balance of the Legislature … and turn around the direction of our state.”
This contest, to be decided in the Nov. 4 election, is playing out in the 26th Legislative District that encompasses parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor. It is one of the few swing districts where residents are represented by lawmakers from both parties.
Krishnadasan is facing voters for the first time as a lawmaker.  A former school board member, she was appointed to her seat after former state senator Emily Randall, a Democrat, was elected to Congress last year. 
Caldier won a seat in the House in 2014 and has been reelected five times, typically garnering votes from Democrats and independents who view her as one of her party’s more moderate voices.
Krishnadasan won the August primary by 1,158 votes. Most of the margin came in Kitsap County, as only 17 votes separated the two in the Pierce County portion.
The result surprised Caldier. She attributed it partly to Republicans not voting when they saw only two candidates on the ballot. She also said President Donald Trump has “ticked off” a lot of Democrats who may not know the senator but backed her because of her party.
The forum at the Key Peninsula Center in Vaughn marked the first time the two candidates appeared together in this election. They answered questions on rural development, the state gas tax, public safety and spending.

Both candidates sought to stress their public service credentials and desire to put the state on a different path.
Caldier opened by touting her 11 years representing the district, rattling off a few community projects for which she helped secure state funds.
Then she charged ahead, bringing up the oversized elephant in this race, Trump.
“I understand that many people in the room are unhappy with the president … and things going on at the federal level,” she said. “This Senate election has absolutely nothing to do with that.”
It is about whether voters want to end the Democrats’ supermajority and restore “balance back to our state,” she said.
Caldier said Democrats used their lopsided advantage in the House and Senate to pass “the largest tax hike in state history.” She was referring to the $9.4 billion package used to balance the budget earlier this year, plus the $3.2 billion transportation revenue measure anchored by the 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax on July 1.
“I have consistently voted against the gas tax,” Caldier said. “It is one of the most regressive forms of tax in our state. You have to understand, a lot of the moderate Democrats are gone. The far-left Democrats have pushed them all out. As a result, you have a very polarized Olympia and they believe that gas and your usage of gas is a sin, and they believe in taxing it to the level of sin taxes.”
Krishnadasan didn’t play the Trump card that night. Nor did she plug major policy changes she helped her party pass, including a cap on rent increases, unemployment benefits for striking workers and requiring a state-issued permit to buy a gun. Caldier opposed those new laws.
Rather, Krishnadasan promoted her legislation to cut the state’s sales tax, which did not get a vote, and her ability to get Republican co-sponsors on some of her bills. She stressed a commitment to fiscal conservatism.
“As politics grow more and more polarized, we’re losing sight of the fact that our neighbors can’t afford life anymore. Groceries. Child care. This is what I want to focus on,” she said.
Krishnadasan did vote against her party’s major tax bills, the transportation revenue package that included the gas tax hike, and the two-year state budget.
“We are in an affordability crisis right now,” she said. “We need to continue to look at how we take taxes away from our working families and our seniors versus just, ‘where’s our revenue’.”
In the primary, business- and Republican-backed political committees poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into mailers, streaming ads and texts aimed at tying her to the tax and spending decisions of her caucus.
“You’re going to get more information over the coming weeks,” she cautioned audience members in Vaughn. “I want you, please, to remember that when there were tax increases on the table, I voted no. When there were DOGE-style cuts that were proposed, I voted no.”
The two candidates are scheduled to participate in additional forums before ballots for the Nov. 4 election are mailed out.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/primary-2025-krishnadasan-caldier-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-23 07:57:12.917499

Photo by Getty Images.As Washington Republicans’ attacks on renewable energy and voracious data center electricity demand threaten to push electricity prices higher, utility commissions in five red states are fighting a widely-supported effort to keep power bills in check. 
They’ve filed a complaint asking federal energy regulators to halt development of a $22 billion slate of proposed high-voltage electric transmission lines that would expand an existing network stretching from Kentucky to Minnesota and the Dakotas. They argue the Upper Midwest’s main power grid operator dramatically overstated the lines’ financial and environmental merits while improperly allocating their construction costs to states that say they don’t need them. 
On the other side is a motley coalition of electric utilities, tech companies, agribusinesses, environmental groups, a Republican governor and a couple potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders who support the investment.
The new lines are expected to be in service by 2034, strengthening links between the windy, sunny Plains states and population centers further south and east.
The fight over the transmission lines highlights a key flashpoint in the energy sphere, as cheaper renewable energy runs headlong into a lack of transmission capacity and political hostility from Republican states. 
“These improvements will save customers billions by avoiding costly inefficiencies and diversifying the market of generation resources across the region,” Gov. Tim Walz, who’s running for a third term, said in a Sept. 16 letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker made similar arguments in letters earlier this month. Like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois have statutory mandates for 100% carbon-free electricity — Michigan by 2040 and Illinois by 2050. Both governors are potential 2028 presidential candidates. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds of wind-rich and mandate-free Iowa also pushed back on the five utility commissions’ complaint in a Sept. 5 letter hailing her state’s “all-of-the-above energy strategy” and name-checking President Trump.
The new infrastructure “will ensure continued reliability and resilience of the electric grid not only in Iowa but also across the region,” she wrote. Killing the new transmission investments, she added, could in turn stall seven nuclear reactors’ worth of new power plants in her state “by months to even years.”
The Indiana-based nonprofit that operates the electric grid in Minnesota and parts or all of 14 other states asserts the proposed lines — collectively known as LRTP Tranche 2.1 — could pay for themselves more than three times over. 
That’s more than enough to qualify them as “multi-value projects” whose costs can be spread broadly across the territory of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator — known as MISO —including among ratepayers in Republican-controlled states without ambitious decarbonization goals. Stakeholders across the region had ample opportunity to weigh in on the proposed lines, a MISO spokesperson told the Reformer.
Before finalizing the tranche last year, MISO led “a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement as well as more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits,” MISO spokesman Brandon Morris said in an email.
Representing the public utility commissions of Montana, North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, the complainants argued that the cost allocation effectively subsidizes the development of wind and solar farms far from population centers — and, by extension, Midwestern blue states’ clean energy goals. Instead of asking Montana and North Dakota to share the burden, they said states like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois should build more clean energy and transmission within their own borders.
North Dakota’s GOP congressional delegation said much the same in a Sept. 11 letter urging regulators to grant the complaint and undo the cost allocation framework. 
“The current approach to cost allocation is a subsidy scheme that alleviates certain states of the costs of their most aggressive energy policies…while out-of-state ratepayers bear the costs,” U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak and Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven wrote.
Belying the complaint, Minnesota is building plenty of clean energy on home soil. Renewables supplied 33% of the state’s electricity in 2024, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, and a state law that accelerates permitting for wind, solar and other energy infrastructure took effect in July. Solar power projects approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission since then will supply nearly a nuclear reactor’s worth of energy as they come online over the next few years. 
But regardless of how it’s produced, experts say high-voltage transmission is needed to move electricity across longer distances. 
“One of the key concepts of a renewables-based system is you want the grid to be bigger than the weather,” said Mike Schowalter of Fresh Energy, a St. Paul-based clean energy nonprofit. 
Transmission lines built to deliver coal-fired power from North Dakota to Minnesota now catch a fair amount of wind, which supplies more than one-third of North Dakota’s electricity. North Dakota officials said during MISO’s stakeholder engagement process — before the utility commissioners’ July complaint — that they’d like to see more of that, Schowalter said. 
East of the Rockies, power generally moves from west to east, but the prevailing flow often reverses during winter storms and other extreme weather events, Schowalter explained. To ensure everyone has enough power under the circumstances, utilities can either build lots of transmission and some power plants or lots of power plants and some transmission.
“The latter is far more expensive,” Schowalter said. 
Building lots of new gas-fired power plants — something that’s already likely to happen as more AI data centers come online — could push up natural gas prices, Schowalter said. Because gas plants often set the local price of electricity, and fuel represents a significant fraction of their operating expenses, that means costlier power.
“The world that the complainants envision is one of more expensive electricity, and our AI industry is going to be at risk,” he said. “We are shooting ourselves in the foot.”
MISO appears to agree.
“The complaint jeopardizes the ability of MISO and its state partners to support the anticipated growth in electricity demand and would increase costs to customers within the MISO region by replacing an efficient, regional solution with a piecemeal one,” the grid operator said in a Sept. 9 filing that called the utility commissioners’ proposal “haphazard and unrealistic.”
Schowalter said a setback for Tranche 2.1 would mess with the delicate grid planning process and delay the arrival of new power plants that MISO, utilities and big customers were counting on. 
Ironically, those delays could slow deployment of the the very gas plants meant to stabilize the grid as AI data centers multiply. 
The Data Center Coalition, a tech industry trade group, made this point in a Sept. 9 filing. 
Though Schowalter said MISO allocated less than 2% of total Tranche 2.1 costs to North Dakota and Montana, their utility commissions’ complaints make sense: They don’t want to pay at all for investments they believe benefit others.
The other three commissions’ motivations are less obvious because federal energy regulators have prevented MISO from allocating Tranche 2.1 costs across its southern region.
Colby Cook of the Louisiana Public Service Commission told the Reformer that LPSC “has always supported the MISO regional transmission planning processes” but joined the complaint for two main reasons. 
The first was “the unreasonable underlying assumptions relied upon to justify these projects as (multi-value projects),” Cook said in an email. Beyond decarbonization benefits, the complaint objected to MISO’s estimates of how cost-effectively the new high-voltage lines could be built and the extent to which they would improve grid reliability and reduce the need for new power plants.
Second was the concern that Louisiana — though not currently required to pay the proposed new costs — could be on the hook later.
Legal representatives for the other four commissions did not respond to a Reformer request for comment.
Perhaps recognizing the need for a speedy resolution, the complainants themselves have asked federal regulators to expedite the complaint. It’s unclear whether the feds will agree. 
In the meantime, a key piece of the Midwest’s future power grid is in limbo. 
“If the complainants are successful, MISO would have to redo at least a year’s worth of work,” Schowalter said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tariffphoto2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 07:57:12.917499

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Just weeks before Roy Lee Ward’s scheduled execution, the Indiana Parole Board heard conflicting portrayals Monday of the man condemned for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne.
The five-member panel will make a recommendation to Gov. Mike Braun, who has the sole authority to decide whether to grant clemency and commute Ward’s death sentence to life in prison. His execution is currently set to take place before sunrise Oct. 10 at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

Ward declined to appear before the board or submit to a prison interview, however. 
In a sworn affidavit last week, Ward told the parole board that he preferred for his attorneys to be his “voice” during the clemency process.
“My decision rests in part on my desire that the victim’s family not be put in a position where they feel compelled to travel to Michigan City,” Ward wrote in the Sept. 17 affidavit obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Defense attorneys Michelle Law and Larry Komp instead spent about 80 minutes before the parole board during Monday’s hearing in Indianapolis.
“Roy is not a psychopath,” Law said. “His own attorneys labeled him as such before … but Roy has feelings, and he himself has recognized that he has disabilities and issues that he wanted help for.”
But for Payne’s family, decades of anguish remain. 
“We will never hear her voice, never have the joy of watching her grow into the incredible woman she was meant to be. Grief doesn’t just break our hearts, it reshapes who we are, and we don’t get to go back,” Stacy’s mother, Julie Payne, said through tears. “We have to learn to exist in a world without Stacy.”
‘He showed Stacy no mercy’
Deputy Attorney General Tyler Banks urged the board to deny clemency, calling Ward “a murderer, a rapist, a predator and a manipulator.”
“Twenty-four conscripted Hoosiers from two different counties have seen who Roy Lee Ward is and what he did to Stacy Payne. And those Hoosiers made what was likely the toughest decision of their lives and decided that the death penalty was appropriate,” Banks said.
Ward pleaded guilty to rape and murder in 2022. He has twice been sentenced to death — first by a Spencer County jury in 2002, then by a Clay County jury in 2007, after the Indiana Supreme Court overturned the initial sentence. He remains the only person on Indiana’s death row to receive two death sentences from two separate juries, Banks noted.

“Granting clemency would not only negate the holdings of those state and federal courts and all the work done to litigate cases before those courts,” he continued. “Granting clemency would override the judgment of 24 Hoosiers for a person who committed the most horrific crime one could imagine, against a 15-year-old girl who was an honor student, cheerleader, member of her school’s student council and played in her school’s band.”
The state’s roughly 80-minute presentation included testimony from six witnesses: Dale Town Marshal Matt Keller, the first officer to respond to the scene and who took Ward into custody; Jane and Murray Stout, two Spencer County first responders who arrived shortly after and provided emergency medical care; Randy Cutrell and Rob Priest, both with the Indiana State Police, who worked on the case; and Julie, Stacy’s mother, flanked by her sister — Stacy’s aunt — Diane.
Banks detailed the attack, emphasizing how Ward bound Payne’s and “bludgeoned” her with a dumbbell, causing 18 blunt force injuries.
Ward raped the 15-year-old and cut open her abdomen and throat, “leaving her barely able to breathe and unable to talk.”
Keller, the first on scene, said he found Ward “standing in the threshold of the door,” holding a knife. 
“I told Stacy I was a police officer … that she was safe and that people were coming to help her. Stacy was unable to speak, but I knew that she understood, because she seemed to relax a little bit.”
“Ward is pure evil,” Keller continued. “He absolutely deserves no mercy.”
Jane Stout, who attended to Stacy at the scene and on the way to the hospital, said she had “never seen anything this brutal in my life.”
“The whole time we had her, she was conscious and alert. She would try to answer you, but with her throat being slit in half, she couldn’t communicate,” Stout described. “She had tears in her eyes. A 15-year-old girl, beautiful … and here she is laying in the back of an ambulance with her body cut in half and her throat slashed. … The whole community was hurt by this, and it was devastating to everybody.”
Julie Payne remembered her daughter as “happy and full of life, always lifting everyone up … an extraordinary girl.” 










We will never hear her voice, never have the joy of watching her grow into the incredible woman she was meant to be. Grief doesn't just break our hearts, it reshapes who we are, and we don't get to go back.


– Julie Payne, mother of Stacy Payne


“Now, our family gatherings are no longer whole,” she told the parole board. “Birthdays are sad reminders of what we lost, instead of celebrations of all the milestones that Stacy will never reach: graduations, a wedding, and children of her own. She didn’t even get her driver’s license.” 
The Payne family, she added, “has endured emotional devastation for 24 years and two months. That is 8,839 days.” Denying clemency, Julie said, would show that “Stacy’s life mattered, that justice will stand for the innocent, and that Ward’s heinous crime will not go unanswered.”
“There is a quote that says time heals all wounds. But that absolutely is not true in this case, where a child is brutally murdered and dies a horrific death because of evil,” she said. “You carry the pain every single day.”
Defense argues autism, remorse, false narrative at jury trial
In the morning session, Ward’s attorneys sought to dismantle the narrative of their client as a psychopath. 
“What we are here to tell you today is that is not true, that Roy is not a psychopath,” Law said. 
She cited Ward’s new autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Law told the board that Ward’s language-processing impairments and social difficulties — now recognized as symptoms of autism — had been misunderstood for decades, leaving jurors with a distorted picture of who he was.

Affidavit of Roy Lee Ward
 
Komp said Ward’s trial counsel “became advocates for a death penalty, telling the jury years ago that “Roy has no conscience, no empathy, no feelings.”
“That is not true,” Komp emphasized. “Psychopaths don’t feel guilty, and they don’t feel they should be punished. Roy wanted help in the worst way.”
Law and Komp returned to the affidavit Ward submitted to the parole board last week. 
In it, the death row inmate cited “concerns that due to my learning disability and language impairments, the messages I mean to convey are sometimes difficult for me to accurately express. My disability, specifically autism spectrum disorder, also affects the way I am perceived by others. I want to avoid any misinterpretation of my remorse.”
Pressed by Board Chair Gwen Horth on why Ward avoided an interview, Law said, “It’s not because he isn’t remorseful.”

“It’s because he has trouble expressing his remorse and finding the words,” she told Horth. “He just didn’t feel like he could use the word sorry — that the word sorry to him just sounded fake, and that it wouldn’t be believed.”
When asked what Ward would say to the Payne family, Komp told the board that Ward would say “that he realizes all the shame he brought to his own family — it’s 1,000 times worse for the Payne family.”
“He would hope he could live out his life, but … if the board does not grant clemency, he deserves to be punished,” Komp continued. 
Law, pitching in, said Ward would tell the Payne family “that he does deserve for (the execution) to be carried out. … And Roy’s preparing himself for that.”
Komp also described Ward’s faith on death row, but acknowledged that Ward’s expressions of faith are difficult to capture because of his difficulties with communication. Even so, he said Ward regularly prays, discusses scripture with spiritual advisors, and has “grown more” religious during his years on death row.
What happens next
Ward’s clemency filings submitted to the parole board additionally stressed his remorse. 
His defense counsel pointed to a letter to his first trial judge, in which he wrote: “I never did much for my life, but she was going to do a lot with hers. I’m terribly sorry for what I did. … I can’t ask for their forgiveness … I do ask for God’s forgiveness and can only hope he is willing to listen to me.”
The filings also outlined Ward’s history of mental health struggles, including treatment at Central State Hospital years before the crime.
Execution moves forward as questions linger around Indiana’s lethal injection drugs

Attorneys emphasized that Ward sought help even as a teenager, telling doctors, “I want to find out what is wrong with me.” Ward’s counsel argued that such statements reflect remorse and self-awareness inconsistent with the “psychopath” label used at his trial. 
The lawyers further highlighted Ward’s efforts to maintain relationships with family, fellow inmates and even a pet cat over the years as evidence of empathy and emotional capacity.
Ward’s clemency petition is one of the final steps available to avoid his death sentence.
The parole board hears arguments from attorneys, victims’ families and execution supporters before issuing a recommendation to the governor.
The governor alone has the power to commute a death sentence to life in prison, grant a reprieve or deny clemency altogether.
Earlier this year, the board followed the same process for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, ahead of his scheduled execution. But unlike Ward, Ritchie appeared before the panel at the state prison.
Following several hours of hearings, the parole board ultimately — unanimously — recommended against clemency for Ritchie, and the governor allowed his execution to proceed.
There is no timeline for the board’s recommendation. Deliberations happen behind closed doors.
In Ritchie’s case, the board issued a recommendation one day after the second and final hearing. Braun rejected the clemency plea the following day.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, citing questions about Baird’s sanity.

Anna Aho Rink, a physician assistant at Upper Great Lakes Family Health Center announced her campaign on Thursday, becoming the first Democrat in the district aiming to challenge state Rep. Karl Bohnak (R-Deerton).
For 17 years Rink worked as a physician assistant at the Planned Parenthood Marquette Health Center until the facility closed in April, with Planned Parenthood Michigan citing threats to federal funding from President Donald Trump’s administration. 
In a news release, Rink cited those cuts, alongside Bohnak’s vote in support of the Republican-led House’s budget, which would cut funding for rural healthcare in the Upper Peninsula as well as the State Police, as her motivation for running. 
“I’m running for state representative to fight for and protect this place that we love. Because the UP needs more access to health care, not less,” Rink said in a video announcing her campaign. “Our children need well-funded schools. We need jobs that are good paying and reliable. We need to work to preserve our beautiful lakes, forests and wildlife for generations to come. I’m running to protect our way of life.”
In 2024, Bohnak triumphed over then state Rep. Jenn Hill (D-Marquette), flipping the district red with just over 51% of the vote. With the House now split 58-52, Michigan Democrats are looking to reclaim the seat they lost in the last election cycle. 
The 109th House District covers Alger, Baraga and Marquette counties and part of Dickinson County.

Mikie Sherrill (D) said the state could seek to force them.","Jack Ciattarelli and Mikie Sherrill shake hands at the 2025 Gubernatorial Debate. Sept. 21, 2025. (Courtesy of Kevin Sanders for the New Jersey Globe)New Jersey’s gubernatorial candidates both want school districts to consolidate as a cost-saving maneuver, but they differ on whether the state should force districts to merge with their neighbors.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, said during Sunday’s gubernatorial debate that she would first incentivize mergers but added that compulsory consolidation was an option.
“I’d start by offering the carrot to help the areas that want to consolidate, but when there are areas that are not putting enough money into students, into educators, into the buildings, and then they are taking a lot of money in property taxes and from the state level, then we’ll have to start to look at compulsory movements,” Sherrill said.
Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, likewise said he would seek to boost incentives and assistance to municipalities and school districts seeking mergers, but he pledged not to force them.
“I do not believe that our state government should force consolidation. That’s up to the locals,” he said. “But I’ll tell you what, if you do consolidate or you do regionalize, Governor Ciattarelli will help incentivize that to make it easier.”
Sherrill and Ciattarelli are vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who cannot seek a third term in November.
Officials have long hailed school consolidation as a means of easing local property taxes by reducing duplicative administrative and facilities costs, but uptake has been slow.
New Jersey had 590 operating school districts during the 2024-2025 school year, according to state data, down from 599 in the 2020-2021 school year.
The number of non-operating districts — districts that have a board of education but send all their students to schools in outlying districts — fell from 17 to 16 over that same time period. Sherrill signaled those districts could be the first merged if she wins the governor’s race.
“We have some school districts who have the whole administrative cost, all of the buildings, and yet they’re not even running a K-12 school system, so we do need to merge some of these school districts,” she said.
Schools consume a majority of local property taxes — 52% of all those collected in 2024, according to property tax tables published by the Department of Community Affairs — and the more than $15.1 billion in school aid approved in the current state budget accounted for more than a quarter of all spending approved in the annual appropriations bill for the current July-to-June fiscal year. That total includes more than $4 billion in combined special education, transportation, and other categories of aid separate from the state’s school funding formula.
Ciattarelli suggested school vouchers — which allow property tax dollars to follow a student to a private school, a public school outside their district, or a charter school — could be a fix for ailing districts.
“When a school system is failing — and there’s some reasonable metrics that tell us whether or not a school system is failing — there’s got to be choice,” he said. “That choice comes in the form of vouchers. That choice comes in the form of charter schools.”
Because vouchers typically draw from school district funding, they could cause funding to decline at in-district public schools as students seek education elsewhere.
New Jersey lawmakers have considered compelling school district mergers or shared service agreements, but to date, such mergers have been entirely voluntary.
Murphy, who has generally favored school mergers, last year said he was “not wild about compulsory” consolidation, cautioning that home rule, a constitutional framework that gives local governments broad authority over the administration of school and other municipal services, could limit forced mergers.
A law he signed in 2022 created grants for districts to study whether consolidation was feasible, though only a handful of districts have explored such mergers since.
Cape May City Elementary School and West Cape May Elementary School are the latest to receive grants to explore a merger. Together, the two Cape May County schools have just 241 students.

(Photo courtesy of Megan Hufton)Megan Hufton’s two sons, AJ and Asher, both have been diagnosed with autism. Neither speaks.
But she doesn’t see autism as the “horrible, horrible crisis,” President Donald Trump described at a Washington, D.C., press conference Monday. 
Nor does she agree with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said at an April press conference that “autism destroys families” and is an “individual tragedy as well.”
Hufton said Monday that the message she hears in such statements is that “it’s going to be a horrible, horrible tragedy” if a family member is autistic. “It’s not the way I describe our family or our lives at all.”
People with autism, their family members and advocates said the messages coming from the Trump administration are harmful and wrong. 
”People with autism are being identified as [a] population of people whose existence the government seeks to prevent or change into people who are more ‘normal,’” said Beth Swedeen, executive director of the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (BPDD), in a statement Monday. “Autistic Americans have the same unalienable rights as all Americans, the right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. We all find different ways to achieve these things, and it is the individual, not the government, who decides our own worth.”
“People with autism have always existed,” said BPDD Chair Sydney Badeau. “We are part of what humanity looks like, and we are amazing.”
In interviews, four Wisconsin residents with autistic family members and an adult autistic self-advocate expressed similar views.
After years in which attitudes towards autism and understanding of people with autism have been improving, “this is taking everything back,” said Heather Murray, a Waunakee child care provider whose 20-year-old son has grown up with autism.
“It’s frustrating to hear it still being called a disease,” Murray said. Autism encompasses a broad spectrum of behaviors that might come with mild or severe disabilities for some people, she said, but it’s not a disease that can be cured.
“It is a way of being,” Murray said. “It is who they are. You can’t take the autism away from them.”
Jenny Price of Madison has a 16-year-old son who is autistic. An active volunteer in advocating for Wisconsin parents whose children have disabilities, Price said she’s been paying attention to how Kennedy has talked about autism since he took office at HHS.
Kennedy has said “that autism is something to be feared, it is epidemic, it steals our children, it ruins families — which are all things we know are not true and I just find it pretty unhelpful,” Price said.
At the Monday press conference Trump and Kennedy focused on claims that linked the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy to autism. Medical experts said the evidence does not support those claims.
“Current research shows an association, but it is limited and inconclusive,” said Rechelle Chaffee, executive director of Autism United of Wisconsin, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa. “Autism we know is not caused by a  single factor. It’s caused by multiple variables.”
In addition to being the parent of two autistic teens, Hufton is the education and training specialist for the Autism Society of South Central Wisconsin.
“Some of the strongest scientific evidence that we’ve seen shows that there is no causal link” between acetaminophen and autism, Hufton said. “We support scientific based research, but also we want to make sure that research is grounded in science, it’s grounded in compassion and respect for these individuals, and really just making sure that we’re promoting inclusion.”
Trump also made references to debunked claims linking vaccines to autism.
“We’ve studied vaccines,” Hufton said. “They’ve been studied for decades and the research doesn’t support this claim. So it definitely makes us concerned about this messaging that is once again just kind of implying that there’s this single cause of autism and the fear behind it.”
Chaffee said that while $418 million was spent in 2020 on autism research, just 8% of that went to research on improving the quality of support and services for people with autism and their families.
“That’s not a significant amount of money going to improve the lives of people,” she said. “That is a missed opportunity to say the least.”
Price doesn’t expect that to improve in the current administration.
“Are they doing research into what supports or what types of programs make the lives of people with autism better? It’s pretty clear they’re not,” Price said. “Are they going to look for ways to support kids with autism or other learning disabilities in school? No, they’re going to remove anything with the word inclusion from the Department of Education grants.”
Erin Miller, 40, is a resident of Milwaukee’s south suburbs and has lived with autism her whole life. 
“I’m really growing weary of all of the speculation around what causes it.” Miller said.
She wants to see more research on how to help people who have autism and are trying to live full lives now. Those include research on subjects that range from accommodations for autistic women in nursing homes, to research on sleep to improving education services and employment practices that recognize the needs of autistic people.
“I would like to see more practical services that improve our life today,” Miller said.

Although the state government loathes the Forest Service regulation, many residents value the wild lands and wildlife it protects.
The post Wyomingites with deep conservation roots oppose axing Forest Service Roadless Rule appeared first on WyoFile .","Conservation groups, hunters, hikers and Wyomingites carrying on family conservation legacies are resisting the Trump administration’s plan to eliminate the 2001 Forest Service Roadless Rule. 
At the close of the 21-day comment period Friday, the U.S. Forest Service received 625,737 responses to the rollback plan. Opponents also wrote Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, who oversees the agency, advocating for roadless landscapes that nurture wildlife, clean air and water.
“We see firsthand how roads are the single greatest threat to wildlife,” Jackson Hole resident Kathryn Turner, a wildlife artist and valley native wrote in response to the proposed rollback. “They fragment habitat, block migration corridors, and increase collisions,” she wrote.
Turner’s father, John, led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from 1989-1993. Kathryn Turner is the fourth generation to be raised at the Triangle X Ranch in Grand Teton National Park and serves on the Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation board.
“Tourists do not come to look at clear cuts and strip mines.” Lee Ann Inberg-Schuff
Lee Ann Inberg-Schuff carried the conservation torch for her late brother, Kirk Inberg, a Wyoming Game and Fish warden who died in 1991 in a plane crash in the Teton Wilderness while tracking radio-collared grizzly bears.
“Tourists do not come to look at clear cuts and strip mines,” Inberg-Schuff wrote. “Recreation and tourism can be easily quantified and in Wyoming alone, is a $4.9 billion industry.
“Extractive industries are boom/bust at best and so very shortsighted,” she wrote. “Keeping Roadless areas makes the most financial sense.”
Citizens want protection
Considered by Sierra Club “one of the most important conservation wins,” the Roadless Rule rankled Wyoming government from the get-go. The state sued to overturn the protection of 3.2 million Forest Service acres — land owned by all Americans — located in Wyoming. The state’s campaign ended unsuccessfully in 2021 when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal.
The roadless rule generally prohibits roadbuilding and logging across 44.7 million acres nationwide, not counting national forests in Colorado and Idaho, which have their own roadless regulations. The Roadless Rule does not prohibit motorized travel and, by definition, is not a program to close existing roads.
Expanded road access is necessary, the Department of Agriculture said in a notice proposing an environmental impact statement authorizing elimination of the Roadless Rule, because “insect and disease and wildfire activity, especially within the [wildland-urban interface] affects important resources, neighboring infrastructure, and communities.” 
Whether roadless areas are at increased danger of wildfire and its most serious effects is widely debated. Instead of scrapping the rule, the Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service should instead alter it slightly to address fires, one former Forest Service official opined.
“The Trump administration could update the rule to permit temporary roads in roadless areas that are near neighborhoods along the wildland-urban interface to allow for forest thinning or other ecological restoration,” Robert Bonnie, a former high-ranking Agriculture Department official, wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times.
In Wyoming, there’s also disagreement over whether logging is sustainable in the state’s semi-arid climate or more akin to “timber mining” than harvesting.
Many Wyoming agencies, however, fell in line with the Trump administration’s plan. Many citizens did not.

“The public lands around the Wind River Range are the driving force of our [business] and we need them to stay protected,” wrote Jake Dickerson, co-owner of Wild Iris Mountain Sports in Lander. Repealing the rule, “would have a negative impact on the entire economy of our town and the many thousands like it across the west.”
Roadless areas are “[t]he last best places to hunt in Wyoming, and probably the West,” said Lander resident Nathan Maxon.
“Roadless areas are where source populations exist that produce [wildlife] migrants into the surrounding landscape where we can encounter them,” wrote Merav Ben-David, a professor of Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wyoming. Based on decades of experience and study, she said eliminating the roadless rule “will only harm those of us who rely on wildlife for our livelihood and enjoyment.”
Some commenters did not sign their submissions. One 81-year-old said he started visiting national forest lands as soon as he was old enough to drive. He said there are enough roads in national forests already, 370,000 miles of them, “enough to circle the Earth nearly 15 times.”
Another unsigned comment read that once Wyoming land is developed, “it will never return to its natural state.”
Owners of a 56-year family sporting goods business near Wyoming’s Bighorn National Forest said the rollback “will do nothing but negatively impact the Tourism and Recreation sector without any guarantee of significant gain in economic activity.”
A member of a “small rural community in Wyoming” said it was difficult for his fellow villagers to speak up.
“Most residents do not have the ability or knowledge to find this obscure website to make public comment,” the anonymous writer said. “For every person in my community that comments, there are hundreds more who feel the same way and are adamantly against irresponsible policies like this proposal.
“However,” he wrote, “we will all vote.”
State agencies align
Wyoming State Forestry Division’s comments were typical of those made by Equality State agencies. “We are supportive and fully endorse the current proposal to return management discretion of [inventoried] roadless areas to local land managers,” officials at the division said.
Wyoming’s Department of Environmental Quality said it would continue to enforce pollution guidelines in roadless areas. “The proposed rule recission still requires [that] site-specific impacts comply with applicable state and federal regulations,” an agency official wrote.
“Wyoming State Parks aligns with other Wyoming agencies to support the rescission of the Roadless Rule,” wrote Chris Floyd, deputy director of the Division of State Parks, Historic Sites & Trails and the Office of Outdoor Recreation, all part of the agency Wyoming State Parks and Cultural Resources.
The Saratoga-Encampment-Rawlins Conservation District wants the rescission’s environmental impact statement to include more than two options — no action and rollback. It called for the ability for Wyoming and other states to forge their own roadless conservation rules.
In Converse County, commissioners support “reconsideration of [the Forest Service’s] current and misguided nationally driven planning strategy and urges the agency to instead empower local forests with greater authority.”
Teton County has supported protection of roadless areas since 2018 and reiterated its position in a letter opposing rescission of the rule.
Conservation groups and scientists
Wyoming and national conservation groups and scientists filed extensive comments.
“In Wyoming, when things aren’t working quite right, we fix them — we don’t throw them away,” the Wyoming Wildlife Federation wrote. The group likened rescission to “the sticker shock of buying a brand-new truck when all you really need is a repair.”
In contrast to the just-expired 21-day comment period, the 2001 rule was forged after 430 meetings and 1.6 million public comments, the group said. Trout Unlimited, the Wyoming Wild Sheep Foundation and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership signed on to the comment.
An analysis of early submissions showed that 99% of commenters oppose rolling back the Roadless Rule. The Center for Western Priorities, a Colorado nonprofit, made that analysis based on 5,000 randomly selected comments submitted by Friday’s deadline morning.
Protection for wildlife was a major theme of comments. Fully 70% of Wyoming’s roadless areas provide spring, summer and fall range for elk, Nat Paterson, policy director for the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, wrote.
“In Wyoming, 60% of our roadless areas provide irreplaceable habitat for native trout.”Samantha Beard
The 70% figure “comes from our partners at Trout Unlimited who did an analysis of GIS layers looking at Wyoming Game and Fish Department data of elk seasonal range and inventoried roadless areas in Wyoming,” federation Executive Director Craig Benjamin wrote in an email.
The existing rule protects 11,337 climbing routes and boulder problems, more than 1,000 whitewater paddling runs, 43,826 miles of trail, including parts of the Continental Divide Trail, another Wyoming coalition wrote. Wyoming Wilderness Association, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Teton County Backcountry Horsemen, Wyoming Outdoor Council, National Outdoor Leadership School and the Council for the Bighorn Range also said the rule protects 20,298 mountain biking routes.
“In Wyoming, 60% of our roadless areas provide irreplaceable habitat for native trout,” Wyoming Trout Unlimited Council chair Samantha Beard wrote.
Backcountry Hunters and Anglers said the rule protects “strongholds that hunters and anglers rely on for healthy fish and wildlife habitat, unparalleled opportunities in the field, and clean water.” It called for adopting a permanent safeguard — a measure stronger than the existing administrative rule — through the proposed Roadless Area Conservation Act.
The Natural Resources Defense Council had about 100 cosigners to its exhaustive comments.
A rollback would “dramatically harm wildlife areas … negatively impact the forested areas … and allow for corporations to have unchecked access to protected wildlife areas,” the Society for Conservation Biology wrote. It referenced a rare study of the effectiveness of the Roadless Rule.
“Many [roadless areas] are among the most wild, undeveloped areas both in the nation and within their respective states,” according to the study “Conservation value of national forest roadless areas,” which included about 15 pages of references to science papers. Roadless areas “protect drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people [and] add significantly to the total carbon captured by existing protected areas.”
The Forest Service will analyze the comments, favoring those that are constructive, information-rich and that clearly communicate and support their claims. It will use those to inform an environmental impact statement on the proposed rescission. The final rule, EIS, and record of decision are expected to be released in late 2026, the agency said.

Industry leaders, tax groups and conservationists have different takes on the first federal lease sale under new rates.
The post How will the Big Beautiful Bill’s reduced oil-and-gas royalty rates impact Wyoming? appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal oil and natural gas lease sale in Wyoming this month netted $8.5 million for 32 parcels spanning 39,225 acres, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 
The “bonus bid” proceeds are paid up front and split between the U.S. Treasury and the state. Companies also pay federal mineral royalties as they produce the petrol. 
But the sale — the BLM’s third competitive oil and gas lease auction in Wyoming so far this year — and any resulting royalty payments will ultimately generate less revenue for American taxpayers than sales in the past, conservation groups and one taxpayer advocacy organization say.
The One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, reduced the royalty rate for federal oil and gas from 16.67% to 12.5%. If all 32 parcels in this month’s sale are fully developed, then the lesser royalty rate will reap an estimated $22 million less than under the previous royalty rate, according to calculations by Taxpayers for Common Sense. That would put Wyoming’s loss at $11 million.
Advocacy groups have also noted that a similar royalty rate reduction for federal coal will cost Wyoming about $50 million annually — a revenue loss that many state lawmakers want to rectify.
“Competitive, market-rate royalty rates do not affect industry interest or production decisions — lowering rates only shortchanges taxpayers by reducing future royalty revenue,” Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote.

The BLM, under the Trump administration, doesn’t see it that way. 
Instead, the reduced royalty rate “is expected to spur additional leasing and drilling activity, which in turn supports increased domestic energy production and strengthens U.S. energy security,” according to a BLM statement regarding the Wyoming lease sale.
Oil and gas industry officials in Wyoming agree.
“It simply isn’t true to claim that higher royalty rates always result in more revenue for the federal government,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming President Pete Obermueller told WyoFile.
The Inflation Reduction Act increased the federal oil and gas royalty rate from 12.5% to 16.67% in 2022, Obermueller noted. “Total royalties paid by Wyoming’s industry decreased by 17% from 2022 to 2023,” he said. “In 2024, while still under the IRA-mandated higher royalty rate, federal royalties decreased again, this time falling by a whopping 30%.”
Compounding the issue, conservation groups contend the industry is nominating and acquiring federal oil and gas lease parcels beyond the typical “speculation” required to suss out the potential productivity of new areas. The type of speculation alleged by some conservation groups is to simply hold some areas open to future development, where they fear environmental restrictions in the future might keep them out.
The industry holds a vast amount of federal oil and gas leases that it has not acted on, they note.
One piece of evidence the taxpayer advocacy group points to is what they say is an uncommonly low average dollar-per-acre among successful bids in this month’s lease sale in Wyoming. 
“More than 90% of acres [in Fremont and Natrona counties] were leased for less than $40 per acre,” Taxpayers for Common Sense said. In contrast, some of the highest winning bids were for parcels in Converse and Campbell counties — a highly active oil play — fetching more than $1,000 per acre, including one in Campbell County for $4,612 per acre, based on BLM reports.
The accusation of speculation, or buying federal oil and gas leases to fend off future environmental limitations to development, “is an odd concept,” and doesn’t hold water, according to Obermueller.
“Every single lease ever offered is, at one point, speculative,” he said. “People forget that oil and natural gas must first be found before it can be produced.”
Oil and gas companies that bought federal leases in the Jonah Field in the late 1990s or early 2000s, for example, were considered by some within the industry to be risky, at best, Obermueller suggested. “They paid off quite handsomely for Wyoming.
“Wyoming,” Obermueller continued, “is exciting to oil and gas operators precisely because we are still exploring for resources and testing the horizontal and vertical bounds of oil and natural gas basins. If so-called ‘speculative’ leasing were not allowed, then there would no longer be a mechanism for exploring in Wyoming.”
The BLM’s lease sale this month is the first to “fully” implement myriad new policies under the Trump administration, Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile. The concern laid out by Taxpayers for Common Sense — that the average per-acre bid price suggests overt speculation — he said, holds some merit.
“Only a very small percentage of acres purchased in the sale, 7%, accounted for more than 80% of auction revenue. This points to many of the parcels being leased through speculation,” Underwood said. “Rather than offering a fire sale of leases in important habitat such as crucial winter range for ungulates, we should be prioritizing leasing in areas that are likely for production and adjacent to existing development.”  
The BLM’s next quarterly oil and gas lease sale in Wyoming will take place in December. Go to this BLM webpage for more information.

On Sept. 10, Idaho Transportation Department Director L. Scott Stokes submitted Idaho’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, plans to the Federal Highway Administration and requested Idaho’s share of funding for fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2026. 
The NEVI program was created to develop a connected network of EV charging stations located every 50 miles along designated interstates and highways. 
A working group in Idaho had already gathered public feedback, conducted a study and narrowed down a list of potential sites for charging stations, including potential sites along highway corridors near Bliss, Lewiston and Pocatello.

However, all work on the program was halted in February after Federal Highway Administration officials sent state transportation directors a letter rescinding all previous guidance for the program and suspending approval of state plans, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Federal Highway Administration officials sent the letter halting the project just weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, telling state highway officials to await further guidance from the feds.
That guidance arrived in August, state officials said, and Idaho Transportation Department officials resubmitted Idaho’s plans Sept. 10. 
Idaho officials did not make any big changes to their previous plans, which were updated in 2023 and 2024. But they did submit a siting, feasibility and access study from 2024 and point out the locations in the plans that address the latest guidance the federal government gave states in August.
“These four plans provide compliance with all NEVI statutory and regulatory requirements as stated in the (Federal Highway Administration) guidance referenced above,” Stokes wrote in Idaho’s letter. 
In an interview Friday, Idaho Transportation Department Communication Manager John Tomlinson said Idaho highlighted how it plans to use NEVI program funds each year, included a community engagement report as requested and provided a description of physical and cybersecurity strategies. 
“The immediate next step is we are waiting for approval,” Tomlinson said. 
If Idaho’s plans are approved, Tomlinson said the NEVI working group would reconvene and spend several months assessing how to implement the plan.

The good news, columnist Kerry Drake opines, is that the vast majority of Wyomingites value these lands, so MAGA forces trying to exploit them are outnumbered. 
The post Assault on Wyoming’s embattled public lands is just getting started appeared first on WyoFile .","If you’re worried about the ongoing assault on our public lands by President Donald Trump and Congress, be prepared for a long, ugly fight. It’s only just begun.

Opinion

Public land advocates scored an impressive victory in June, when their protests forced the removal of Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s provision to sell more than one million acres in the West to private interests from the obnoxiously named “One Big Beautiful Bill.” 
But MAGA-backed officials will stop at nothing until they can sell public lands that belong to all Americans to the highest bidders so corporations can build roads through pristine wilderness areas, allow the mineral industry to “drill, baby, drill,” and let the timber industry run wild in our national forests.
The good guys — the public, our environment and wildlife — won’t win until voters decide they’re fed up with elected officials who want to exploit public lands and vote them out of office. That’s a great goal but one that can’t be easily or speedily accomplished in a state as bright red as Wyoming.
These federal rules and actions that protect the environment are currently in jeopardy:

U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wants to rescind the U.S. Forest Service’s Roadless Rule that protects 59 million roadless acres considered vital to wildlife.


The U.S. House passed a controversial resolution that states the Bureau of Land Management’s plan in Montana that restricted coal leasing has “no force or effect.” It’s now in the hands of the U.S. Senate.


The BLM has opened public comment on a plan to roll back its Public Lands Rule that gave conservation an equal footing with industrial uses of property owned by all Americans.


Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order restricting use of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was created more than 60 years ago to buy and preserve recreation lands.

In June, hundreds of Wyomingites gathered in Cheyenne to tell the delegation how deeply opposed they are to public land sales in the state, but none of our federal lawmakers accepted invitations to attend. 
State Rep. Karlee Provenza, a Democrat from Laramie, one of the event’s organizers, saw an opportunity to call each official’s office and have the crowd leave a loud message of outrage about Lee’s provision.


I wanted my voice to be heard too, so I gave a full-throated yell to every scripted call-and-response direction from Provenza. It was a diverse, united and fired-up bipartisan crowd. I’ve covered a lot of protests in front of the Capitol, and joined a few when my days as a pawn in the corporate journalism world were over, and I’ve rarely seen one with this much energy.
Which is good, because it’s going to take enthusiastic work to preserve the sacred environment we have in Wyoming against the visions of greedy  extremists who want to privatize it. 
“Sacred” is the right word, because people use it to describe the joy nature holds when we want places to relax, recreate, regenerate our spirits, seek solitude and solace, and connect with this part of the Earth and all of its treasures.
People who want to protect public lands do it for their families, future generations and fellow Americans who are also co-owners of the public land we are lucky to live nearby. We all have a responsibility to care for wildlife by protecting their habitats and promoting conservation efforts.
The direct attacks on public lands, including Lee’s renewed attempt to win support for public land sales, are growing. Rep. Harriet Hageman, the most anti-environmental Wyoming congressperson in my lifetime, is gung-ho to keep up the fight to privatize public lands.
“We never, ever, ever talk about ever disposing of any federal lands under any circumstance whatsoever,” a frustrated Hageman said at a town hall meeting in Cody. “That absolutely makes no sense whatsoever in a growing country.”
When asked why Republicans are in such a rush to sell public lands, Hageman said it’s so the private sector can build more affordable housing. 
Of course, in the middle of nowhere with no infrastructure is obviously the perfect place to build houses the average person can afford. Just keep them far out of sight of the ultra-rich who will build second mega-mansions in Wyoming on their newly acquired former public land.
All four MAGA plans to weaken public lands protections must be defeated. “Unnecessary road development would ruin the value of these public lands for people and wildlife who appreciate them as they are,” long-time outfitter Meredith Taylor told WyoFile.
Amy Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, warned it’s not easy to understand what the changes the far-right is advocating will do. She said Burgum’s order curtailing the Land and Water Conservation Fund “may fly under the radar, but it could be as serious as selling off pieces of federal public land.”
Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss said in a statement that using the Congressional Review Act to throw out the BLM’s Montana plan for Powder River Basin coal risks unleashing “legal and regulatory chaos across the West.” 
If courts interpret the act broadly, Weiss added, management plans written in the past 30 years could potentially invalidate oil and gas leases, grazing permits, and threaten public access to trails and campgrounds.
I hope at least the BLM’s Public Lands Rule that says conservation must be considered on equal footing with other public land uses, including mining, will withstand the far right’s revocation efforts.
Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, nailed how odious this move is: “The administration is saying that public lands should be managed primarily for the good of powerful drilling, mining and development interests, [but] public lands’ role in providing Americans the freedom to enjoy the outdoors, and conserve beloved places … is a second-class consideration.”
Americans have long cherished public lands, so the MAGA movement is outnumbered on this issue. Advocates need to spread the word about how close the West is to losing its public lands if we don’t fight. “Wyoming: Where public land is not for sale” should be the Equality State’s new battlecry. 
It could be a good tourist slogan, too. It shows what we value here.

Amid Suicide Prevention Month in September, three Idaho nonprofits are bringing professional skier, ultrarunner and mental health advocate Drew Petersen to the city for a screening of his film “Feel it All” and a keynote speech. 
In 2023, Idaho had the fourth highest suicide rate in the nation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recently available data show.  
Boise-based nonprofits, The Speedy Foundation, Connection is the Cure, and Youth Mental Wellness Alliance, known as You.Me.We.All, are hosting the screening on at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Egyptian Theatre, according to a press release. Doors open at 6 p.m., and tickets are $15 for adults and $10 for students.
“Deaths from despair impact every corner of our community, but together, we can create a culture where people feel seen, supported, and hopeful,” Speedy Foundation Executive Director Co-Founder Shannon Decker said in the press release. “Bringing Drew to Boise during Suicide Prevention Month is a powerful opportunity to keep building momentum for change. His story is a reminder that even when life might feel unbearable and problems seem impossible to solve, opening up to someone we trust can help us get through it; it gets better.”
Petersen grew up in Colorado and became a sponsored, professional backcountry skier at a young age. He enjoyed success in competitions and getting featured in skiing films, but told The Guardian his mental health struggles began at a young age, and they were exacerbated by numerous concussions. He eventually was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder, which is characterized by periods of hypomania — lots of energy, low sleeping, partying and very focused — and then periods of depression that can last months.  
In 2017, Petersen was hit on the head by a falling rock on a ski trip. After the nearly lethal injury, his suicidal ideation became mores serious, he told the Guardian, and he reached out for help. 
The film “Feel It All,” which Petersen directed, depicts his experiences with mental health and suicidal ideation, which he will connect with the “urgent realities facing Idaho and the Mountain West,” the release said. 
“The communities I’ve been fortunate to connect with have shown me that we don’t just need these conversations around mental health, but that the people want these conversations of mental health and suicide prevention elevated,” Petersen said in the press release. “I consistently receive messages that Feel It All has saved lives and given people the courage to ask for help for the first time or finally follow through. That’s the power in talking about all of this and it’s why this series of in-person events will bring that impact to the Boise community.”
Youth Mental Wellness Alliance is a nonprofit founded by Boise School District parents looking for community solutions to meet the growing need for youth mental health support. 
Connection is the Cure is an organization provides connections through workshops, training, service projects, and other activities to those who’ve been affected by suicide, mental health, and addiction. 
The Speedy Foundation is a nonprofit named for Boise-native and three-time Olympic skier Jeret “Speedy” Peterson, who died by suicide in 2011. The organization originated in Idaho and Utah but has since expanded to other states.

All 99 Assembly seats will be up for election in 2026 and it will be the second time that legislative maps adopted in 2024 will be used. Under those maps, Democrats were able to gain 10 seats in 2024, bringing their numbers up to 45.
Jessica Seawright announced her campaign for the Assembly on Monday. (Photo courtesy of campaign)
Their goal for 2026 is to hold all of their seats and gain at least five more in order to flip the chamber. Republicans have held the Assembly for the last 15 years.
Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) currently holds the 21st seat located in Milwaukee County, including Oak Creek and a portion of the city of Milwaukee near the Mitchell International Airport. She was first elected in a special election in November 2013, and has won reelection six times. Since 2021 she has also been a member of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, which is responsible for writing the state budget every two years. 
Under the new maps, Rodriguez won another term in 2024 with 51% of the vote against her Democratic challenger. According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the district leaned Democratic by 4 percentage points in the presidential election and 7 percentage points in the U.S. Senate race. Rodriguez has not yet  announced her reelection campaign.
Seawright said the new legislative maps provide the opportunity to ask for more from representatives. 
“I wanted more — more understanding, more presence and I decided that it was time to step up,” Seawright said. 
Seawright was joined at her launch event Monday by state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) and Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee). The Oak Creek venue where she made her announcement was previously part of Sinicki’s districts, before the maps changed.
Seawright said she sees the 21st as a 50-50 district.
“It’s really close, and not everyone is going to agree with me,” Seawright said. “The strength that I believe that I bring is decades of training, listening to people, understanding their perspective, understanding the impact of coming off extremely partisan, and what that does to stifle coordination, collaboration and participation of the voters of their residents in a community.” 
Seawright said her family has lived in Wisconsin since 2018, first in Racine and now in the Garden District community in Milwaukee. They moved from Utah because they had family in the state who would help with caregiving and respite for her 10-year-old son. 
“We have a fantastic neighborhood. I love it,” Seawright said. “We have community support. We have some great work happening in our parks,” including projects to make the spaces more accessible. 
Seawright said she has been working to build a coalition over the last six months leading up to her launch and she is launching over a year out from next year’s general election in November so she has time to get to know the district. 
“I want to be out there. I want to have open-ended conversations that aren’t pressured by me asking for folks’ vote before I earn it,” Seawright said. “I want to show up. I’ll be out in the community… I have the opportunity starting early to do the work that it will require to run for this office.” 
Her 10-year-old son, who has complex medical needs due to a genetic condition, is the major reason she became an advocate. She joined U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin to speak out against cuts to Medicaid and told the story of her son qualifying for and receiving services through the Katie Beckett program, which helps children with disabilities access Medicaid coverage while living at home instead of being in an institution. Her son also received a waiver for children’s long term support through Medicaid. Seawright worked with the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities and serves on the state’s Council for Children with Long-Term Support Needs. 
“I began to have the opportunity to spend time with adult self-advocates, and that was so powerful and inspiring, and it’s motivating,” Seawright said. “You want to step up. You want to be there to make sure that your friends feel heard.”
Seawright said that she wants to work for an expansion of Badgercare — Wisconsin’s Medicaid program — even as federal changes to Medicaid by the Trump administration caused Gov. Tony Evers’ administration to declare that it is “fiscally and operationally unfeasible” to expand it due to changes in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act.
“I look forward to exploring the options that make it feasible, because right now, we’re looking at folks on the marketplace having premiums increase so high that they’re going to lose access,” Seawright said. 
Seawright said that fully funding public education is another of her top priorities, especially increasing the special education reimbursement that public schools receive from the state. 
The special education reimbursement rate was raised to 45% under the most recent state budget passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed into law by Evers. It is the highest rate in years, but fell below what Democrats and public education advocates had called for — a 60% or even a 90% rate.
“Kids like my son, who do need various services in order to access public school, have costs that are mandated by federal protections… I’ve heard from school boards and other school leadership, teachers that it is often pulled from the general fund, and it is making it very difficult to create the inclusive educational environment that I dream of for my son,” Seawright said. “I’d really like to continue and come back to special education reimbursement.”
She said she is flexible about the size of the increase to the reimbursement.
“I look forward to building connections with local leaders, with school boards, within the state Assembly, and talking about a pathway forward that moves us up every year, that moves us on a trajectory where Wisconsin regains its prowess around supporting our kids,” Seawright said. 
Her background as a social worker and her research on criminal justice inform her focus on improving community safety through treatment, prevention and alternatives to incarceration. 
“I am grateful for the work of first responders, for police officers, and I’ve worked alongside correctional professionals at the juvenile and adult level, and that’s kind of where I’m coming from,” Seawright said. “I am seeing what first responders are being asked to do… My mom is an emergency room nurse, and I see what folks are going through in terms of what comes into the emergency room, and I’m dismayed by any changes moving us away from prevention services being funded.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)The state is fighting to keep information confidential about the Tennessee Highway Patrol’s participation in mass immigration sweeps earlier this year, arguing in court Monday that the highly politicized nature of the enforcement activities could make troopers a target of violence or harassment if made public.
The state’s arguments mirror those of federal immigration officials who have contended that agents with Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, or ICE, need to conceal their identities to protect themselves and their families from retaliation as they carry out mass enforcement responsibilities. 
The arguments came as the state defended itself in a public records lawsuit filed in Davidson County Chancery Court by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition. 
The nonprofit filed suit last month against the Tennessee Highway Patrol, or THP, and the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, alleging the agencies had failed to meaningfully respond to a request for records and video footage it was seeking to shed light on mass immigration sweeps in Nashville earlier this year. 
Immigrant group sues for records, footage of Nashville immigration sweeps

Hundreds of drivers were stopped in a neighborhood with a large population of immigrants as part of the so-called Operation Flood the Zone, a joint operation between the THP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE; 196 immigrants were ultimately arrested, according to data subsequently released by ICE. The activity occurred before the THP had formally entered into an agreement with ICE to conduct immigration enforcement.
The state delayed providing video of the stops and other documents, and heavily redacted the reports it did provide to exclude a host of identifying information that “made it hard to understand what police did and why they did it,” attorneys for the nonprofit argued, citing the example of one redacted line that read, “Queried [license number] on behalf of XX.” 
Zachary Barker, senior assistant attorney general, said the state had removed trooper names, badge numbers, car numbers and other identifying information from dispatch reports to “protect troopers who protect us every day.” 
Barker, citing state law he said has applied only to undercover officers in the past, also argued that redacting information such as patrol car numbers was appropriate because “a radical political extremist could take that information…listen to the police scanner and learn where and when an officer will be.”
And, he argued, that redacted THP “unit numbers” are used as part of the process to log into the agency’s computer system, posing a threat to operations if exposed.
Michael Holley, an attorney for the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, called the scenarios Barker described “just far-fetched.”
Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency continues traffic stops, arrests in Nashville

“There’s no basis that this has ever happened,” he said. “Frankly it’s absurd this is the state’s position.”
Holley noted that THP officers wear name tags and badge numbers in public. How, he asked, could “the information that’s used in public…become confidential when someone asks for it.”
The identities of law enforcement officers participating in arrests and traffic stops is public information, said Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government.
Fisher said she knew of no other instance when a state trooper’s name was redacted from traffic stop records in Tennessee.
The practice, Fisher said, could undermine public trust in law enforcement.
“We have to maintain public trust in the police, and the officer’s name is part of that public trust,” she said.

“If there’s a safety reason, we need to know. The public needs to know what kind of threats have been made or what kinds of actions taken,” she said. “Tennesseans don’t want people threatening our officers, but they also don’t want secret police.”
In legal filings state attorneys cited national statistics that said 13.5% of sworn officers were assaulted in the line of duty in 2004, a total of 85,730 assaults that year. 
Troopers engaged in immigration enforcement face even greater risks, they said.
“While troopers face danger every day as they protect Tennesseans, connecting a specific trooper’s identity to an operation involving highly politicized immigration enforcement increased the danger to that trooper,” the state’s legal filings said. 
A legislative effort is also underway to shield the identities of Tennessee law enforcement participating in immigration enforcement.
A bill filed by Sen. Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, which would make confidential the name of any federal state or local officer or official participating in immigration enforcement activities in Tennessee, will be considered when the legislature reconvenes in January. The bill’s language also calls for officers’ personal information, including addresses and phone numbers, to remain confidential. Tennessee law already protects officers’ private information from public dissemination.
Chancellor Russell Perkins, who presided over Monday’s public records hearing, said he would rule “as quickly as I can” on the petition by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition to force the state to promptly turn over all requested records.

At the time Facebook was young but rapidly expanding, Twitter was just starting to catch on, and Instagram hadn’t yet launched. I recall being asked in interviews: “This is all pretty alarming — somebody fired for what they write in a blog — but does it really ever happen beyond isolated examples?” I replied that it’s uncommon but surmised that expanding social media makes it plausible we’ll see more of it. 
In the years since, we have indeed run across plenty more examples , but the blizzard in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s death takes it to a whole new level. What in recent years might amount to an occasional news item about someone’s occupationally perilous expressive choice has this month morphed into a mass right-wing parade of zealotry (with the vice president as grand marshal) marching to trample on the reputations and livelihoods of anyone who is disinclined to venerate Charlie Kirk as a cross between Martin Luther King and Jesus Christ, and willing to share that reluctance publicly. 
Let’s be clear up front that freedom of speech does not entitle you to keep your job no matter what nugget of genius you choose to broadcast in your off hours. Ken Paulson, who heads Middle Tennessee State University’s Free Speech Center, puts it aptly and succinctly: “The First Amendment is not always on your side when you are raging at the world.” 
If you’re an at-will employee in the private sector, your work-related free speech protections are near nil (though some things like labor organizing and whistleblowing have protections). Your boss may be an idiot when you are fired for righteous declarations that you like the Mets and hate the Yankees but not a legally imperiled idiot. In public sector work, on the other hand, you are entitled to speak out on matters of public concern without fearing for your job — unless your employer can make a legitimate claim (read: persuade a jury, if it comes to that) that your speech compromises workplace harmony or operational efficiency. 










The First Amendment is not always on your side when you are raging at the world.


– Ken Paulson, Middle Tennessee State University Free Speech Center


Importantly, compromising harmony or efficiency does not —and should not — equate to offending the boss’s political or parochial sensibilities. Workers should not be canned merely because in their off hours they have provocative or controversial things to say on social media or in other public settings. Freedom of speech means the freedom to be not just provocative but also the freedom to be stupid, insensitive, distasteful, callous, disagreeable, unsympathetic, remorseless and even hateful on your own time and on your own dime. 
Are there cases where an employer can credibly claim that awful speech aired in public does make it impossible for the person to do their job or the workplace to function? Sure, but as a court decision in a Memphis case a few years ago involving a public utility worker’s racist social media reminded us, mere speculation of virality or social backlash without proof isn’t enough.
Even in the private sector employers would do well to choose restraint over impulse. And they would do extra well to remind themselves that they own part of their employees’ days, not the whole of their corporeal existence. Amid reports of multiple suspended workers for Kirk-related remarks on social media, Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastion reminded employees that “we all represent Delta, at all times, in any forum.” Sorry, Ed, but no, they don’t. He continued: “It’s essential that we act in ways that uphold our shared values and the human connection that defines us.” No, it’s not, except maybe during work hours. 
None of this is helped by the legal cluelessness of the person who is supposed to be the nation’s chief law enforcement officer. Asserting that “there’s free speech and then there’s hate speech,” Attorney General Pam Bondi promises “we will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” Only if you want to violate the constitution, as even conservative Associate Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito knows full well (p. 25, first paragraph). 
It is troublesome that university academics are being targeted (and not just because that’s my day job) and that Tennessee elected officials including Gov. Bill Lee and Sen. Marsha Blackburn seem to be taking particular pleasure in hounding university leaders to take action. Of course Bill and Marsha have the right to be as outraged as they like at whatever they like — free speech lives! — but they might want to temper their glee with a little remedial consideration of the dark and sordid modern history of academic censorship. 
Sorting through the various posts for which free-speaking Kirk antagonists have been shipped off to unemployment lines, one finds some that are certifiably hideous, but others are merely disagreeable, and some essentially inoffensive, amounting to little more than pointed critique.
As always when free speech is on the table, the hard part is drawing the borders between these categories. What makes America’s First Amendment brand of free speech unique and wonderful is that for the most part we don’t try. Now is not the time to start.

Justin Taylor/The Current GA/CatchLight LocalThis story was done in collaboration with The Current GA and is part of an ongoing series examining Georgia’s school voucher program. 
Georgia’s new program to subsidize private education has helped more than 8,000 children move from public schools with low test score averages to educational organizations predominantly affiliated with Christian churches, data from the Georgia Education Savings Authority shows. 
About $5.4 million of the $7.1 million distributed by the state authority at the start of the fall school semester went to 286 private schools serving 85 counties and nine cities, according to a data investigation by The Current GA and Georgia Recorder. 
The remaining cash — $1.7 million — went to 153 companies, including giant retailer Amazon, that sell school supplies such as computers, tablets and books, records show.
As many as 8,600 private students make up the first cohort receiving the Georgia Promise Scholarship, the program approved in spring 2024 by the Republican-led state legislature and Gov. Brian Kemp. Eligible children must live in areas served by the lowest-performing 25% of the state’s public schools.
Under the program’s guidelines, families receive $6,500 per year for each child to pay for the switch to a private school or homeschool or other educational supports. Parents receive the money through an online state portal, where they then allocate the dollars to an approved private school or to a company to purchase educational materials or services. 
The new state agency overseeing the voucher program spent more than a year finalizing rules, setting up an application portal and reviewing applications from schools, students and vendors. According to GESA, nearly 15,300 families applied, yet thousands were determined ineligible.
It will take at least 15 months before Georgians will have metrics from GESA’s first review to evaluate whether the promise of the sweeping policy — better quality education and more competition for public schooling — is fulfilled.  
Companies are leading beneficiaries
For now, however, data from the first dispersal of funds in July show dozens of private companies are the leading beneficiaries of the fledgling voucher system. 
Amazon received the largest amount from the voucher funds, with $302,000 in sales. The next three largest recipients of funding were electronics vendors headquartered outside of Georgia.
The private school with the largest amount of funds from the voucher program was Newton County’s Covington Academy with $120,701. It is the only school to have received more than $100,000. Tuition there runs $5,500, plus fees.
In Coastal Georgia, the state authority ruled that some students from Liberty and Chatham Counties were eligible for the vouchers due to zoned public schools’ low rankings. Hinesville’s First Preparatory Christian Academy, where tuition ranges from $6,500 to $7,900, plus fees, has received the most money among private schools in the coastal counties from the program. 

Vouchers failed for years 
Georgia, unlike many other Republican-led states, has been slow to adopt school vouchers, one of the main educational policies championed by the Trump administration, although proponents of such vouchers have been pushing them for decades. 
Back in the 1950s, the then, all-white Georgia General Assembly set up a vote on what its own supporters called “the segregation amendment,” which allowed the state to give educational money directly to residents instead of providing them with a school. That disappeared by the time of a 1983 rewrite of the state constitution. 
In 2007, voucher supporters succeeded in passing a limited program called Georgia Special Needs Scholarship, which focuses on students needing special education. The state annually publishes data on that program, which is still active. 
Conservatives have long sought to widen access to that program, but opponents from both parties have stood in their way. 
In 2018, Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle’s ambitions for governor were scuttled, in part over a policy that supporters say lets Georgians direct a portion of their tax dollars to private schools of their choice. On a secret recording that a political opponent made public, Cagle called it “bad public policy” but said he endorsed it to prevent the Walton Foundation from spending $3 million on behalf of his GOP rival, Hunter Hill.
“It ain’t about public policy,” Cagle said on the recording. “It’s about (expletive) politics. There’s a group that was getting ready to put $3 million behind Hunter Hill. Mr. Pro-Choice. I mean, Mr. Pro-Charters, Vouchers.”  


Sen. Greg Dolezal applauds the passage of his school voucher bill in 2024. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
In 2023, rural Republicans joined most Democrats in the state House of Representatives to defeat a first draft of the school voucher bill sponsored by state Sen. Greg Dolezal, a Republican whose suburban district north of Atlanta has only one school on the list of poorest performers. The first version of his bill would have covered all Georgia public school students.
Those Republicans who stood against the policy worried that vouchers would drain money from public schools in their rural counties, generally the only local educational option in their areas. Democrats, meanwhile, feared that vouchers would simply be a discount for wealthier families already inclined to send their kids to private school. 
But by 2024, Gov. Brian Kemp put the weight of his office behind the issue and declared it time to support families in making the best choice for their children — whether that is public, private, homeschool, or a charter school. 
Enough Republican holdouts signed on to help give the bill the minimum 91 votes necessary to pass the state House. Then-Democratic state Rep. Mesha Mainor of Atlanta also voted to support it, which later prompted her to switch political parties before her re-election bid. She lost.
How does the program work? 
Eligibility for the voucher program depends on the elementary, middle or high school that students would attend, based on their address. If the performance of any one of those three schools is ranked in the bottom quarter of state performance, the student can apply for funds to transition to private education. But there is  no statewide list of students with all three zones they inhabit, so there is no official estimate of how many students are eligible, either.
About one in four of the first students in the program come from families that earn more than four times the federal poverty income level. That number varies with family size but for a family of four, it means about $129,000. About 52% of the students are Black; most of the rest are white. 
Public schools are ranked by the average of their last two overall scores on the annual College and Career Ready Performance Index — a measure of student progress and mastery of reading, math and science.
Schools’ CCRPI scores can swing up or down by more than 30 points a year on the hundred-point scale. The School of Humanities at Juliette Gordon Low in Savannah went from a 53.2 in 2023 to 69.7 in 2024. That gave it an average score of 61.45, low enough to land in the bottom quarter of schools.
Statewide, the biggest swing came at Atlanta’s M.A. Jones Elementary. Its 2023 CCRPI was 75.7; the next year it scored 40.9.  Atlanta is considering consolidating the school with another.
A school can rise out of the bottom quarter quickly, but once a child is in Georgia Promise, they have priority to stay, regardless of any improvement in their public school. The state is set to update its school rankings by Dec. 1.
For eligibility verification, GESA requires families to submit paperwork showing their own address and the kids’ public school transcript or other official school materials. There’s an exception for rising kindergarteners who don’t have any records with a public school — about 32% off the first cohort.
Grading the schools
Public school performance is measured by hundreds of metrics published online.
The law requires private schools to give voucher recipients a standardized test — either a state one for the student’s grade level or some other national test GESA might approve. And private schools will also need to report on voucher students’ attendance, course completion and graduation rates. 
GESA must make its first report to the legislature and the public on student performance, demographics and parent satisfaction in December 2026, once it has the benefit of a full school year’s worth of data. 
But it is undecided yet whether that report will include school-by-school data. Some private schools will have so few students that detailed reporting could compromise student privacy. A GESA spokesperson said it would be premature to comment on the level of detail to be expected in next year’s report. 
And the law does not specify whether poor rates can lead to the expulsion of a private school or vendor from the program. It gives GESA the power to take “corrective, remedial or preventative actions” to protect its interests, the public interest and student interests. 
A state committee of parents with children in the system is set to adjudicate any family, school or vendor who feels wrongly excluded. However, that committee will not start work until after the close of the September student application period. 
Asked how that committee would be chosen and whether its meetings would be public, the agency spokesperson responded, “It would be premature to comment on committee governance prior to their adopting rules and regulations.”
What’s next
Dolezal, the sponsor of the 2024 law, plans to ask his colleagues to amend the legislation when the Georgia General Assembly convenes again in January. One significant change he is seeking: a requirement that unaccredited private schools provide documentation from accreditation bodies confirming that the institution is making a good faith effort to complete the complex multiyear process.   
Dolezal still hopes that school vouchers could be an option to all 1.7 million Georgia K-12 students. 

That “is where I’m at ideologically and philosophically, and I would like to see Georgia get there,” Dolezal said in an interview earlier this month. “I don’t think we have — I don’t think we get there next year. So I wouldn’t be bringing a bill necessarily for that.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250725SCCPSS-104-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 06:57:47.976764

Lawmakers are proposing state support for a plant that would turn wood debris into aviation fuel. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Lawmakers from northern and north-central Wisconsin are circulating a bill supporting Johnson Timber Corp. in Hayward to build a processing plant for aviation fuel made from logging debris to establish a processing plant in Wisconsin.
The legislation would reward the company with a $60 million tax credit and access to $150 million in borrowing through Wisconsin’s bonding authority.
Republican lawmakers wrote in a memo circulated Monday seeking cosponsors that the proposal would create 150 jobs and generate $1.2 billion a year in income after three years of operation.
The processing plant in Hayward would be built by Johnson Timber Corp., in partnership with a German company, Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said at a press conference in the state Capitol Monday morning. The German partner is Synthec Fuels, according to Felzkowski’s office.
Wisconsin along with Michigan and Minnesota are all vying for the project, Felzkowski said, “and the state that helps will be the first state” to get the facility and probably the headquarters for the overall processing operation.
She said the process of converting logging waste into aviation fuel was comparable to how corn is grown for and converted into ethanol.
“We will be taking that wood product and turning it into a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation,” Felzkowski said.
As drafted, the bill would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) to create a manufacturing zone for aviation biofuel derived from wood matter and to issue up to $60 million in tax credits for a business operating in the zone.
The bill requires the business to source 80% or more of the wood used from Wisconsin and invest at least $1.5 billion in the project.
The bill also provides for the business to borrow up to $150 million for the project using Wisconsin’s tax-free bonding authority.
At the press conference, lawmakers, Sawyer County officials and a timber industry representative billed legislation as a “forestry revitalization” measure.
Paper and pulp plants in Wisconsin Rapids, Park Falls and Duluth, Minnesota, have all gone out of business in the last five years, accounting for about 30% of the pulp produced by Wisconsin’s timber industry, said Henry Sheinebeck, executive director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.
“We’re growing at a minimum two times more [timber] than we’re harvesting,” Sheinebeck said.  Enabling the timber industry to cut down and make use of more trees would preserve and improve the health of forests in the state, he said.
The association and the paper industry are the joint recipients of an unrelated $1 million grant in the state 2025-27 budget to draw up a statewide forestry industry strategic plan.

(Getty Images)I grew up in Meridian, Idaho, back when it was still a rural town. I became a math teacher, then a social worker, and, for the last 20 years, I’ve worked for nonprofit organizations serving Idaho kids and families. I love this state. But after decades in this work, I can tell you plainly: too many of our children are falling through what few safety nets exist. 
In Idaho, we pride ourselves on strong communities. Neighbors step up in times of need, and families rally to create a brighter future for our kids. Yet today, too many children are waiting for something they cannot afford to wait for: mental health care. 
Idaho ranks among the top third of states with adverse childhood experiences. Too many kids live in homes with mental illness, with over 11 percent experiencing anxiety or depression themselves. The entire state is considered a mental health care desert, where existing providers can meet only 25 percent of the current need. The result is a predictable crisis: families struggle to find timely care, and children’s challenges deepen. This affects classrooms, workplaces, and entire communities. 
I’ve seen the reality behind these statistics. They are not abstract. These are our neighbors, our students, our kids’ teammates. Without access to care, their struggles too often go unaddressed, setting off impacts that last a lifetime. 
There is reason for hope. Kids who once felt lost can find their way back with the right support. At Idaho Youth Ranch, I’ve seen students who had withdrawn from school for years re-engage, graduate, and thrive when given access to quality care. These stories prove that change is possible when communities come together. Research shows that every dollar invested in depression care delivers a seven-to-one return. That return is measured in stronger families, safer neighborhoods, healthier communities, and in lives reclaimed. 
That is why three of Idaho’s most trusted nonprofits — the Women’s and Children’s Alliance, Children’s Home Society, and Idaho Youth Ranch — have come together to collaborate as organizations and share what we can all do to support our kids. With nearly 200 years of combined service to Idaho families, we know this is a solvable problem with focus, action, and a united effort. We’ve already identified one urgent goal: recruit and retain the clinical professionals our children need. 
This is not simply about expanding programs. It is about fixing a workforce crisis that has persisted for more than a decade. Unless we do something now, Idaho will remain near the bottom in national rankings for youth mental health access. And the cost of inaction is steep: more children suffering in silence, more families breaking under pressure, and more futures cut short. 
Our collaboration is an Idaho solution to an Idaho problem. What comes next is action. Together, our three nonprofits are launching a united effort to expand access, strengthen systems of care, and lift up the voices of Idaho’s kids. But it will take all of us. Policymakers who advance legislation. Funders who invest in solutions that work. And community members who show up for the kids in their lives. 
This coalition is aiming for real change — and we need everyone at the table. Each of our nonprofits are here as a great resource, so keep an eye out for more from us, especially ways to get involved and help our kids. 
The time to act is now. Idaho’s kids can’t wait.

Jeff Landry to announce the opening of Camp 57, a facility at the prison that will house immigrant detainees. (Photo by Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana officials are denying reports from over the weekend that immigrant detainees at the state penitentiary in Angola are conducting a hunger strike.
The National Immigration Project and the Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition issued a statement Saturday that said 19 people detained at the state prison were four days into a hunger strike. Their demands include medical care, prescription medication, toilet paper, hygiene products and ample clean water. 
The detainees also want access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to address their complaints about conditions at the prison facility.
Earlier this month, Gov. Jeff Landry turned over a section of Louisiana State Penitentiary for ICE to hold what the governor termed as “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.” 
The four-building complex, formerly known as Camp J, was renovated under an emergency declaration from Landry. Once referred to as “The Dungeon,” it was shut down in 2018 after inmates were able to bypass security measures once its cell locks malfunctioned. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 correctional personnel quit, retired or were fired over misconduct allegations.
“Governor Landry declared a so-called ‘state of emergency’ in order to reopen yet another inhumane detention center on Louisiana taxpayers’ dime. But the real emergency is what’s happening inside: people are being denied life-saving medication, and some may die as a result,” the coalition’s news release said.
The Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections responded to the groups’ claims Monday, calling them “misleading.”
Corrections Secretary Gary Wescott said no hunger strikes were reported at what officials now call “Louisiana Lockup.” The department said officials learned Sunday that “17 ICE detainees had refused their meals. This action appears to have been sparked by false narratives in the media that put the idea in the detainees heads.”
Only three out of the 17 people continue to refuse their meals, according to the corrections department’s news release.
State officials called claims about personal hygiene and medical treatment “false.” All of the detainees received “prompt medical attention upon intake and as needed throughout their detention.”
The corrections department also reported there were no plumbing issues inside Louisiana Lockup, although the advocacy group made no such claims. Officials said one inmate intentionally flooded his cell Sunday morning, but the pipe was quickly unclogged.
The statement from the corrections department did not address the groups’ claims about detainees not having access to a law library and religious services, citing ICE requirements under its Performance-Based National Detention Standards.
The organizations have called for the conditions at the facility to be immediately addressed, the release of those detained and no future ICE transfers to Angola.
The first transfer of ICE detainees to Angola included 51 individuals. Landry had said the number would increase to 200 by mid-September, though state officials have not provided an update on the number people being held since first opening the site.
The complex can hold 416 detainees, in addition to the more than 4,000 inmates housed in other sections of the state penitentiary.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state budget writers have another tough year of spending cuts ahead of them amid rising program costs and a slowing economy.
The state could be about $841 million in the hole next year in a budget scenario that accounts for the budget obligations currently in statute and certain transfers requested by Gov. Jared Polis, according to nonpartisan legislative staff. The Legislature’s bipartisan Joint Budget Committee heard the quarterly economic forecast from Legislative Council Staff and the governor’s office on Monday.
At the same time, those state economists expect the state to collect 7.4% more in revenue in the next fiscal year. That will get eaten up by increased Medicaid costs and other programs.
“We’re no strangers to difficult budget decisions here in Colorado,” JBC Chair Sen. Jeff Bridges, an Arapahoe County Democrat, said in a statement. “Years of thoughtful, bipartisan budgeting puts us on solid financial footing, but with the devastating impacts of H.R.1 along with tariffs continuing to create uncertainty and raise prices for Colorado families, more tough budget decisions are most certainly ahead.”

H.R.1 refers to the federal tax cut and spending bill that Congress passed earlier this year. The measure reduced income tax revenue in Colorado and will eventually put massive new administrative pressures on safety net programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance.
State economists from the Legislature and the governor’s office both estimated a decrease in state general fund revenue in the current fiscal year when compared to a June economic forecast. The Governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting revised its estimate down by about $756 million to $17 billion.
Mark Ferrandino, who heads OSPB, told lawmakers that Medicaid cost increases drive “a significant portion of the structural deficit” and that the federal law will make it worse as the state absorbs more cost. He said Medicaid spending has been growing at about 9% over the past year, while growth in the amount the state can spend under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights has grown at about 4.5%. TABOR is a state constitutional amendment that limits the amount of revenue the state can retain and spend. 
“A growth rate of greater than the entire TABOR amount of growth rate in Medicaid is not something we can sustain, and so we will be coming forward with options, and look forward to working with you on that,” Ferrandino said.
Without a big policy change, Medicaid could take up the whole state budget within 15 years and leave no room for education and other expenses, he said.
“There’s got to be conversations of how we change that — not that we’re going down in funding, but that we’re growing at a slower rate more in line with either general fund growth or with the TABOR spending cap,” he said.
Those soaring Medicaid costs drove lawmakers to cut about $1.2 billion in the budget for the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Polis, a Democrat, called lawmakers into a special session in August to raise more tax revenue to soften the blow of H.R.1’s impact. He also ordered midyear spending cuts and dipped into the state’s reserve funds to help fill the gap. Democrats passed a series of bills during the special session to end tax breaks for some businesses and create a tax credit sale scheme. Legislative staff said Monday those policies will bring in about $252 million this fiscal year, $164 million during the next one and $226 million in the 2027-2028 fiscal year.
Both legislative staff and the governor’s team agree that revenue will not fall above the TABOR cap for this fiscal year, eliminating mandated refunds to taxpayers. There could be modest TABOR surpluses in upcoming years.
Economists worry about a near-term recession driven by high household borrowing, a weakening labor market and impacts from tariffs imposed by the federal government. LCS did not put a probability on a recession, but the governor’s office estimates a 50% chance.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A Shelby County lawmaker who voted in favor of the governor’s education voucher program is questioning the state’s refusal to disclose the number of private-school students using the funds.
“I don’t understand why it’s not available … because it’s my understanding that the private schools do communicate with the public school districts whenever they receive transfers from public to private,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan of Collierville.
A former member of the Collierville School Board, Vaughan voted against the governor’s first plan in 2019 to provide funds for low-income students in Shelby and Davidson counties to spend on private schools. In a special legislative session this year, he voted for the statewide proposal that is providing $7,300 each for 20,000 students to pay for private school costs.
Some 10,000 of the students come from families with no income limit, and the other 10,000 have an income limit at 300% of federal poverty guidelines, about $173,000 for a family of four.
Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville called it “absurd” to withhold information on student enrollment for a new “entitlement” program that drew interest from about 100,000 students already enrolled in private schools.

“It just means we have no idea how this program works or whether it’s effective,” Yarbro said. “Simply getting one out of five of those families to accept an additional $7,000 in their lives is not anything to brag about.” 
Several lawmakers who voted for the bill early this year said they wanted the money to go to low-income, single women to help take their children out of a “failing” school.
Vaughan couched his statement somewhat, saying his constituents who are using the new voucher program “all seem very happy with it.” He wasn’t certain whether those were public school transfers.
The Tennessee Department of Education, which said previously it is not required to release a breakdown on private-school students receiving the money, sent out a statement last week announcing “remarkable results” in the program’s first year.
The release said all 20,000 available seats for the program are “reserved,” after the state received 42,000 applications. It also said students from 86 of the state’s 95 counties received the funds, and that 220 of 241 eligible schools statewide enrolled students.
An Education Department spokesperson did not respond Monday to numerous email questions from the Lookout.
A financial analysis on the bill that passed this year estimated that 66% of the students would be enrolled in private schools already, leading critics of the legislation to call the program a private-school subsidy.
The Department of Education said it reviewed applications in the order they were received, and Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds lauded the launch, saying she’s “thrilled with the success and demand demonstrated in the first year.”
Prior enrollment in a public school isn’t required under the new program as it was with the Education Savings Account program enacted in 2019. But rules for the new private-school voucher program and state Board of Education include a provision specifying priorities for applicants after the first year in case the number of applications exceeds the number of vouchers available.
The department is to revise the application process to meet those requirements, a Department of Education spokesperson told the Lookout in June.











It just means we have no idea how this program works or whether it’s effective. Simply getting one out of five of those families to accept an additional $7,000 in their lives is not anything to brag about.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville 



Legislative Democrats, nearly all of whom opposed the private-school voucher bill, are raising questions about its rollout.
Democrats say they aren’t surprised the state withheld a breakdown on the number of vouchers going to private-school students and those at upper-income levels.
Similarly, they say the state is likely holding back information on enrollment by county because it could show the money is going mainly to the state’s wealthiest counties.
“Fifty percent of the benefit of this program goes to the top 5% of families by income,” Yarbro said. “It’s hard to think of any other program Tennessee has rolled out where that’s the case.”
The program’s total cost is projected to be $1.1 billion in its first year: $146 million for vouchers; $198 million for $2,000 teacher bonuses; $3.3 million to pay districts that lose students; and $2.7 million for administration.
Yarbro believes the cost of the voucher program will increase dramatically because students receiving the funding will need it annually to pay for tuition, as more students apply for the money.

Nonprofits serving North Dakota’s homeless were recently awarded an unprecedented $5 million from the state — a move advocates welcomed, though some cautioned that the need for assistance in their communities is still acute. 
The money supports services including emergency shelters and transitional housing, as well as homelessness prevention programs like rent and utility assistance.
“It’s a positive step in the right direction,” said Michelle Erickson, executive director of the Abused Adult Resource Center in Bismarck, which received two grants totaling $125,000. “But it’s not gonna solve the issue.”
Erickson said that most of the Abused Adult Resource Center’s grant funding will go toward covering operational costs. 
“We operate on very much a shoestring budget,” she said.
The awards, announced in late July by the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency, come from two different programs: the North Dakota Homeless Grant and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Emergency Solutions Grant. 
A total of 18 organizations got $4.2 million from the North Dakota Homeless Grant while seven groups got another $731,980 from the federal Emergency Solutions Grant, according to a memo from the Housing Finance Agency to the North Dakota Industrial Commission.
By comparison, social service organizations last year received a combined $1.8 million from the grants.
Community Action Partnership of North Dakota this year got $2 million from the North Dakota Homeless Grant, the largest award of any recipient. 
The money will be distributed across Community Action Partnership’s partner organizations, which serve all 53 counties in North Dakota. 
About $1.2 million of the award will go to help homeless people find housing services and another $821,000 will be used for homelessness prevention, the Housing Finance Agency’s memo states.
Andrea Olson, executive director of Community Action Partnership of North Dakota, said the organization offers financial support for expenses including rent and utilities, deposits and moving costs, as well as a range of other services like help with housing and job searches, financial planning and more.
The hope is that Community Action Partnership will use the grant to do more in underserved areas including Williston, Dickinson and Devils Lake, said Jennifer Henderson, the Housing Finance Agency’s community housing and grants management director.

The Housing Finance Agency’s awards increased significantly this funding cycle because the North Dakota Homeless Grant recently quadrupled in size.
The Legislature approved $9.85 million for the grant for the 2025-2027 biennium, compared to the $2.5 million set aside for the 2023-2025 budget.
“I really applaud the legislature for doing that,” Olson said. “They heard a lot of testimony, they did a lot of homework and research and realized that there was a need for increased financial support.”
Henderson said another combined $5 million will be awarded from the North Dakota Homeless Grant and the Emergency Solutions Grant next year.
The amount applicants sought from the grants this year still far exceeded the amount of money available. Applicants requested a total of $7.5 million from the North Dakota Homeless Grant and $2.4 million from the Emergency Solutions Grant, according to the Housing Finance Agency.
While the 2025 Legislature set aside about $10 million for the North Dakota Homeless Grant this biennium, it rejected other homelessness-related proposals brought by state agencies and advocates.
This included $1 million for a liaison for students who are homeless or at risk of homelessness  in public schools and another $50,000 to fund a homelessness study. The same policy package, forwarded by the interim Government Services Committee, also proposed putting $200 million into the Housing Incentive Fund to create affordable housing across the state over the next four years. The bill failed in the Senate.
Additionally, the Legislature approved $150,000 for a homelessness liaison to Native communities, though Gov. Kelly Armstrong later line-item vetoed the sum. Armstrong said he objected to the one-time funds and instead prefers comprehensive and sustainable solutions to homelessness.
A total of $25 million will be transferred to the Housing Incentive Fund for affordable housing projects over the 2025-2027 biennium, according to a September memo by Legislative Council. 
Last week, organizations that serve the homeless held their annual resource fair in Bismarck. The event, Project Service Connect, offered free haircuts, food, toiletries, vaccinations and shared information about services in the community.
One attendee, Hunter Short Bear, said he appreciated the opportunity to have a meal and stock up on supplies. He said he wished more state leaders cared about what homeless people go through instead of judging their situation.
Homelessness increases in North Dakota as population, housing costs also rise

State data indicates homelessness has increased in North Dakota over the last few years.
Data from North Dakota’s Homeless Management Information System shows that 3,824 received services for homelessness in 2024, a slight increase from 2023. In 2021, this figure was 3,325, according to the database. Organizations that serve the homeless and those facing housing instability use the system to track the people they help.
The Housing Finance Agency’s 2024 Housing Needs Assessment, published in February 2025, likewise found that demand for housing across North Dakota outpaces the supply. This is especially true among low- and middle-income households, according to the report.
Erickson said she doesn’t expect increases in federal funding for homelessness services anytime soon.
“It’s not gonna go up,” she said. “If anything, we’re gonna lose funding.”
Federal programs created to keep people housed during the COVID-19 pandemic are coming to a close, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services noted in a March press release.
President Donald Trump’s administration has signaled a desire to roll back support for homeless services, including by proposing major cuts to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s housing programs, though Congress has yet to finalize a budget.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-23 10:00:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,‘The gaps have become too big for too many’,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/the-gaps-have-become-too-big-for-too-many/,"Physicians, policymakers, and advocates hope to make a breakthrough this term on legislation that would boost the share of health care dollars that go toward primary care amid provider burnout and growing wait times for appointments.","WHEN A GROUP OF health care practitioners, policymakers, and industry leaders gathered last week to continue their examination of Massachusetts’s faltering primary care system, the discussion turned more than once to Albert Einstein. 
Attendees were not hopeful that general relativity or a mathematical proof might provide the key to reinvigorating a shrinking workforce or to cutting the months-long wait patients face for new appointments. Instead, they referenced a quote often attributed to Einstein: “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” 
Stephen Martin, a physician and UMass Chan Medical School professor, invoked the famous – and likely apocryphal – quote to urge his counterparts to take big swings in their work. 
“The arrangements we have going forward, if they are not different from what we have now, we should expect failure, just as Einstein said many, many years ago,” Martin said at a meeting of the state’s primary care task force earlier this month. “If there’s not a delta in what we eventually come to, we should be wary of any constructive results.” 
Some policymakers and advocates have spent years trying, and failing, to convince legislative leaders the state should force new investments in primary care. Former Gov. Charlie Baker twice filed bills that would have required providers and insurers to boost their spending on primary and behavioral health care. Those provisions never earned a vote in the House or Senate, and Baker reflected shortly before he left office that his effort to overhaul the payment model “freaked everybody out.” 
But as conditions on the ground worsen for patients and burnt-out providers, supporters say they sense growing momentum for a primary care spending goal that would steer more money toward the system’s front lines. 
“I would be surprised if by the end of this legislative session, there was not major primary care legislation that included a primary care spending benchmark,” Wayne Altman, a physician and founder of the Massachusetts Primary Care Alliance for Patients, told CommonWealth Beacon.  
Massachusetts already has a benchmark in place for total health care spending, designed to set a goal for keeping cost growth limited. It’s had limited success: Total health care expenditures per capita increased 8.6 percent in 2023, more than twice the 3.6 percent benchmark. 
Some advocates and lawmakers have been clamoring to add a primary care-specific spending target to state law, a metric that would dictate how much more providers and insurers need to spend or what share of their health care dollars need to go toward primary care. 
While many industry leaders and elected officials tout the value of primary care, only a small fraction of health care dollars actually flow its way. In 2023, the most recent year with state data available, MassHealth spent about $35 per member per month on primary care services, or 7.5 percent of its total health care expenses. The share of spending on primary care was even lower for commercial health plans (6.7 percent) and Medicare Advantage (4.2 percent). 
Significantly more money goes to other areas of spending. In 2021, commercial health plans spent about $2,108 per person per year on hospital outpatient care, such as surgeries and drug infusions, according to Health Policy Commission data. They spent less than one-quarter as much – $500 per person per year – on primary care. 
A hospital oversight law Gov. Maura Healey signed in January created the 25-member task force and assigned it with crafting recommendations on how the state should define and track primary care services, strengthen the workforce pipeline to bring new providers into the field, and set a specific spending target for primary care. 
Asked if the governor would support codifying a primary care spending target, a Healey spokesperson on Monday did not answer directly and said only that the governor “will review the recommendations of the task force.” 
The panel faces a mid-December deadline to report its findings on primary care spending targets. At a September 17 meeting, several members voiced support for the idea of requiring a certain share of health care expenses to go toward primary care. 
HPC Executive Director David Seltz floated one possible approach to tee off debate: setting a target that 15 percent of total medical spending in Massachusetts would be allocated for primary care by 2034, phased in over an eight-year span with an increase of one percentage point per year. 
Seltz said that would increase spending on primary care by a bit more than 10 percent each year. 
The spending target would be only one reform among many others, and Seltz mentioned changes to payment and care delivery systems as important complements. But he called a specific threshold written into statute “a bold message as a state to say, ‘This is what we’re working towards, and we’re all working towards this together.’” 
Both Altman and David Gilchrist, executive chair of primary care for Atrius Health and Reliant Medical Group, countered during the task force discussion that they feel an eight-year ramp is “way too long.” Instead, they suggested more than doubling the share of spending over a four-year period instead. 
“The struggle with primary care is like a tug of war. The Massachusetts state Legislature just put 25 people on our side of the rope to try and help with this tug of war to fix primary care, except we keep losing. Even though there’s 25 more of us on this side of the rope, we’re going backwards,” Altman said. “We don’t have eight years. Our patients don’t have eight years to wait to fix this.” 
But one key detail could fuel a fight ahead: Supporters want to increase the share of spending on primary care without accelerating overall health care spending growth, which is already careening past cost-control targets. 
Growing one slice while keeping the pie about the same size would mean less money for other areas, like specialty care and pharmaceuticals. Those segments of the industry are not pushing back yet – at least not in public – and opposition could arise as the debate unfolds. 
“We haven’t heard anyone really loudly opposing this idea yet, but I think as it builds more momentum, we’ll probably start to hear from more of those players,” said Suzanne Curry, director of policy initiatives at Health Care for All. 
Lora Pellegrini, who leads the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said insurers would back a primary care spending benchmark if it did not result in overall expense growth. 
“So long as we’re not adding new dollars to the system and we’re working within the benchmark of existing expenditures, the plans are very supportive of enhancing primary care practices and transforming them so that they can really invest in wellness models of care and keeping people out of the hospital and out of the emergency room,” she said. 
Supporters say deploying a greater share of funds to primary care can pay economic dividends in the long term by catching problems early or preventing them altogether, thereby avoiding costlier emergency care. 
While the task force’s recommendations continue to crystallize, there’s no shortage of urgency.  
The HPC issued a stern warning about the outlook for primary care in January with a report – titled “A Dire Diagnosis” – that found an aging workforce, a sluggish pipeline of new physicians entering the field, and long wait times for appointments. 
Valerie Fleishman, chief innovation officer for the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association that represents hospitals and health systems, said the industry group is “especially alarmed by the workforce trends” in that report. 
“Even while Massachusetts outpaces much of the nation in primary care spending and access, the gaps have become too big for too many,” Fleishman said, pointing to research from the Milbank Memorial Fund that identified significant primary care problems across the country. 
“We look forward to seeing how the [task force’s] recommendations can help align our system’s primary care strategy, build up this essential profession, and address the financial limitations that providers are facing,” she added. 
The growing shortage of primary care providers spells major headaches for patients. 
One in four Massachusetts residents surveyed in 2023 reported they were unable to get an appointment with their doctor’s office or clinic as soon as they needed it, according to the HPC. Two in three sought care in the emergency department for a nonemergency condition because they could not get an appointment.  
A CommonWealth Beacon poll published this month found 24% of Bay Staters waited between three weeks and two months to see their primary care provider. Another 20% waited longer than two months.  
Patients in the Boston area face some of the longest waits in the country to book routine check-ups. 
Researchers at AMN Healthcare, an industry staffing company, earlier this year contacted physician offices in 15 major metropolitan areas to schedule new patient appointments and recorded how long someone would need to wait. 
A patient in the Boston area faced an average wait of 69 days when booking a physical with a new provider, by far the longest of all 15 cities surveyed and nearly three times the average from the full sample, which also included New York City, Seattle, and Philadelphia, according to a report published in June. (The average wait in Boston was even longer for some specialty care such as cardiology or obstetrics and gynecology, AMN found.) 
“The primary care crisis is ever-deepening as we’ve been meeting,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kiame Mahaniah noted at the task force meeting. 
Some entities are pursuing new approaches in the meantime. Mass General Brigham and CVS proposed an affiliation in which MGB patients could receive in-network primary care at MinuteClinics operated by the pharmacy giant across the state. 
The HPC voted to subject that proposal – which drew skepticism from some physicians – to a more extensive cost and market impact review, which will analyze its expected impact on health care spending. 
Early in the 2025-2026 legislative session, Healey and Senate President Karen Spilka both signaled interest in supercharging primary care, but both stopped short of supporting a specific primary care spending benchmark. Neither have put forth specific policy recommendations. 
Healey used her State of the Commonwealth address in January to pledge to “shift health care resources to the front lines.” 
“I want a whole army of primary care providers out there, so when you call for an appointment, you’ll get one,” she said. “You’ll get the affordable care you need, where and when you need it.” 
In her own inaugural remarks two weeks before Healey’s, Spilka said she planned to examine “comprehensive health care reform, including taking a close look at primary care delivery.”  
One top Spilka deputy, Sen. Cindy Friedman, is one of Beacon Hill’s biggest proponents of enshrining a primary care spending target. Friedman again filed legislation this term that would gradually impose a requirement for 12 percent of total medical spending to go toward primary care, among a suite of other reforms to payment models and behavioral health coverage. 
In an interview, Friedman said she expects that some kind of primary care legislation is “in the mix” this term, especially as federal funding cuts squeeze the state’s broader health care system. 
“Maybe people will be more attentive because we are going to be losing lots of federal dollars, and we’ve got to take some of the pressure off of our hospitals and our hospital systems,” Friedman, one of the Legislature’s representatives on the primary care task force, said. “People without insurance are going to show up in emergency rooms – which is incredibly expensive, right? – so if we can’t figure out a way to get up front of this problem, get at the front door, which is primary care, then we are going to just exacerbate a very, very bad situation.” 
The outlook in the House is less clear. In January, after Healey’s annual speech, House Speaker Ron Mariano called primary care “an interesting challenge.” 
“I’ve been doing health care since 2006. We’ve had a couple of initiatives to create additional primary care. We’ve put incentives to medical schools, tuition rate for primary care. It’s very difficult to get doctors to enter into a primary care practice,” he said at the time, according to State House News Service. “I’ll listen to what [Healey and Spilka] have to say, but I know there are certain barriers that are hard to get over if you want to create primary care.” 
Past attempts to force an increase in primary care funding have gone nowhere in the Legislature. 
Baker filed bills in 2019 and 2022 that sought to force providers and insurers to boost spending on primary care and behavioral health services. 
His plans took a different approach than the legislation currently pending on Beacon Hill.: Instead of requiring a specific share of total health care spending to go toward primary care, Baker’s bills would have called on insurers to boost primary care spending 30 percent over three years without increasing the state’s overall benchmark for health care cost growth. 
Neither proposal advanced beyond the Health Care Financing Committee, which Friedman has co-chaired since 2019. 
Friedman said policymakers and stakeholders struggled with Baker’s bill to figure out how to track whether additional dollars would flow toward primary care. The task force’s work should help address those issues, she said. 
“The other piece … that makes it really challenging is we don’t want to spend more money. We just want to spend money differently,” she added. “A hospital will say, ‘Hey, yeah, sure, let’s spend more money on primary care, but don’t take it away from filling beds, [or] don’t take it away from the specialists that we have.’” 
Curry, of Health Care for All, recalled that Baker was one of the first to make a concrete push for increased primary care investment. At the time, she said, “there wasn’t really as much of a groundswell from other folks outside of government as there is now.” 
Asked why the idea has been so hard to get over the finish line, Friedman said “the devil’s in the details.” 
“In any change, somebody has less of something when somebody has more of something,” she said. “Different stakeholders see that, and they get anxious. In this environment, where health care is just being attacked so constantly by the federal government, people just are even more anxious. It’s human nature, when you get scared to pull back, to fight or flight, and entities do the same thing, when it really behooves us, what we really should be doing is sitting down together and figuring out how we can do the least harm while we’re taking care of such an important and critical issue for our residents.” 
So what gives backers any confidence the latest advocacy push will be any different? 
Part of it, Altman said, is the existence of the task force, which will put concrete ideas into writing in response to a legislative request. The other key factor is just how bad the situation has gotten since the first bill was filed years ago.

Robert C. Byrd in this undated photo from the 1960s. (West Virginia State Archives)Hulett C. Smith, who served as the governor of West Virginia from 1965 to 1969, is still admired for his progressive policies and significant contributions to the state. In my mind he was the best governor ever to occupy that office, and none that have followed him have even come close to the high standard he established. 
During his tenure, he championed civil rights, environmental protection, modernizing state government and educational reform. Smith’s administration saw the passage of landmark legislation, including the state’s first, comprehensive strip-mining laws and the establishment of the West Virginia Human Rights Commission. His commitment to improving the quality of life for all West Virginians and his forward-thinking approach to governance have left a legacy, making him one of the most respected figures in the state’s political history.  
One of Smith’s greatest accomplishments, if not the greatest, occurred early in his administration.  On March 18, 1965, two months after taking office, he signed Senate Bill 517 into law ending capital punishment in West Virginia. Introduced by Dels. Robert Holliday of Oak Hill and Jesse Barker of Charleston, the bill represented a monumental step forward in progressive thinking. Today, all West Virginians should justifiably be proud that the state is one of only 23 without a death penalty. 
Education was one of his top priorities from the beginning, but addressing environmental problems and developing West Virginia’s recreational potential received much of Smith’s attention throughout his four years in office.
Smith’s high importance on education demonstrated that he kept the faith with what he termed the most important West Virginia citizen — “the 6-year-old child entering the first grade next fall.”  His $32.5 million ($325.69 million today), 3-year education package, dubbed “Decision ‘65,” gave $1,300 dollars in teacher pay raises over the period and provided additional budgetary support for administrative, custodial and secretarial employees and matching funds for Head Start, a federal program designed for preschool children from low-income families. With participation in all 55 counties, West Virginia, under his leadership, could boast of the most complete coverage in the nation at the time.
Perhaps his greatest strides though were in the realm of conservation. The passage of a strong strip mining bill ranks as one of his most monumental achievements.  The bill was soon tested when Department of Natural Resources Director T. R. “Pete” Samsell denied a permit to strip mine across the New River from Grandview State Park near Beckley. Samsell denied the permit based upon the grounds that it would ruin the aesthetic value of the park’s main overlook.  The Supreme Court later upheld his decision.
Another feature of the bill was that it kept an already existing special reclamation fund and imposed a $30 per acre fee to reclaim older, abandoned strip mines. In 1968, his last year in office, 20,000 acres of denuded lands were reclaimed in compliance with the new law. Unfortunately, subsequent administrations have greatly weakened the provisions of the law.
During the prior administration of Gov. Wallace “Wally” Barron, then Department of Natural Resources Director Warden Lane entered into a contract with House of Delegates Speaker Harry Pauley to mine coal underneath Panther State Forest in McDowell County. In doing so, Lane illegally bypassed the statutory authority of the Public Land Corporation and exposed this valuable, state-owned land to the detrimental effects of mining. At one point, there were as many as 120 mine openings throughout the forest; and trout stocking in Panther Creek, which bisected the area, had to be discontinued.  With Smith’s blessing, DNR aggressively pursued the cancellation of the lease in court and was ultimately successful in halting all mining activity. 
During the presidency of John F. Kennedy, West Virginia was awarded $24 million in federal funds to greatly expand its state park system. Despite some initial hiccups, the program was rolling along smoothly at the end of Smith’s term. New state parks were added at Pipestem, Twin Falls and Cannan Valley and additional recreational facilities were constructed at several others.  A strong air pollution control law was enacted during his administration and a stream pollution control measure also passed.
Space doesn’t permit listing all his accomplishments nor does it allow discussion of some mistakes he made — most notably retaining several members of the previous Barron administration who were later indicted. Federal officials made clear, however, that Smith was not implicated nor did any of the illegal activity occur under his watch.  
West Virginia won’t see the likes of him in the governor’s office again. His remarkable four years will never be duplicated given today’s average voter. With some exceptions, since his time in office, the brightest and best educated individuals have continued to leave the state. What remains is an undereducated, ill-informed conservative population that lacks the knowledge and understanding of the key role the government should play in our lives to create positive changes for all.

(Photo by Sarah Ladd).Kentucky doctors say the best way people can navigate confusion about COVID-19 vaccines this fall is to talk to their primary care providers.  
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has narrowed eligibility for the COVID-19 shots more than four years after the vaccines were approved for emergency use, leaving patients and even some providers unclear on who should get the shots. 
On Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) narrowly voted down a proposal to require prescriptions for COVID-19 shots. The committee members voted in favor of recommending vaccines for those 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions like cancer, dementia, heart conditions and more. The committee recommended younger people discuss the vaccine with their medical provider in a “shared clinical decision-making” process. 
Infectious disease expert Dr. Mark Burns, an associate professor at the University of Louisville and a medical doctor with UofL Health, said getting a vaccine without meeting those criteria “will not hurt” a person. 
“What should be recommended is to talk with your primary care provider,” Burns said. “Between the patient (and) the primary care provider, they can look at what’s called ‘risk-benefit’ of getting the vaccine, and then the decision can be made between the patient and their provider whether they should have the vaccine or not.”  
Misinformation ‘recipes’ 
Unclear and inconsistent messages about vaccines are “recipes” for more anti-vaccine sentiment, Burns said. 
“Anytime you have inconsistency, there are a lot of issues that can arise,” Burns said. “When there’s nothing in black and white…worst thing, vaccine hesitancy can occur. And also, there could potentially be proliferation of misinformation.” 
Dr. Elizabeth Hawse, the immunization representative for Kentucky’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a Lexington pediatrician, said she sees misinformation in her patient population about COVID-19 vaccines and other issues.
“Medical misinformation, whether it be vaccines or otherwise — it can be for lots of other things — is just out there,” Hawse said. 
It’s key for people to get “your information from a credible source,” she said. The nuance of science and medicine can’t be adequately explained in a short social media video or post, she said. And, she said, some people may fit into the “high risk” list without realizing it. Any disability that hinders daily life, mood disorders like depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), being considered overweight, physical inactivity and more all qualify a person as “high risk.” 
“We all want to believe our kids are low risk. A lot of people are…shocked that their child is high risk,” Hawse said. “It’s best to go in and just have a conversation (with their doctor) about: ‘what should our family be doing?’” 
For now, vaccines are generally covered by insurance, and many children in Kentucky get theirs covered through the Vaccines for Children program, Hawse said. She is carefully monitoring any changes to that coverage, though, as the COVID-19 vaccine is expensive (she buys doses for around $200 each). 
“If you have three kids and two adults in a family, you’re to $1,000 pretty quickly,” she said. “So the insurances paying for that vaccine is important.”  
Fall and winter spread 
Meanwhile, Hawse has some concern about the spread of the virus this fall and winter. Vaccines don’t enter the body and immediately give a person full protection, she said. 
“It does take a couple of weeks to fully respond to a vaccine,” she said. “You’d like to get that in before it’s cold and we’re all sitting inside together and not really able to do as many outside activities.” 
The school year began last month and Monday marked the first day of fall. COVID-19 hospitalizations and emergency room visits have consistently been higher in the colder months in Kentucky, according to data from the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. 
COVID spreads through droplets that are released in the air while an infected person breathes and can be inhaled or land on someone else, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lending itself to easier spread when people are in tight, indoor spaces. 
“Things that spread in the schools tend to spread to the community, because those children don’t go to school in a vacuum,” Hawse said. “Those children have parents. They have family members.” 
Vaccination is the “first and foremost” way to keep the spread of COVID-19 low going into the fall and winter, Burns said. 
“People can also utilize the public health mitigating measures that we’ve used before, such as hand washing, social distancing and, if you’re at risk, even wearing an N95 mask indoors,” Burns said. “If you’re at risk, those things can certainly help decrease the spread.”

(Photo: NCGA videostream)If the North Carolina justice and mental health systems had a dollar for every time a conservative politician vowed to “get tough on crime,” or attempted to blame a terrible incident on “soft on crime” policies, both might actually have long ago garnered enough funding to fulfill their duties.
As, however, has been repeatedly made clear down through the decades (and as even a casual glance in the present moment confirms), neither system comes close to being adequately resourced.
This sad reality has been brought front and center again in recent days in the aftermath of a horrific murder in Charlotte and the subsequent and familiar call from opportunistic politicians to “crack down” on crime (and make political hay) through the enactment of “tough” new laws.
The brutal and seemingly random killing of Iryna Zarutska (a refugee from Russia’s war on Ukraine) allegedly committed by Decarlos Brown, Jr. with a long criminal record and history of mental health problems — captured in a gruesome Charlotte transit system security video — has spurred leaders at the North Carolina legislature to advance a bill they’re dubbing “Iryna’s Law” that they say will help prevent such incidents.
Under the legislation, which the Senate unveiled and passed Monday, state law governing the pre-trial release of people accused of certain crimes would be made more difficult and powers of magistrates would be altered.
The News & Observer reported that Brown, who had previously served a five-year state prison term for armed robbery, was arrested twice in 2024 and once in January of this year for misusing the 911 system to “ask police to investigate a ‘man-made’ material he said controlled when he ate, walked, and talked.”
Sponsors of the bill say the magistrate in front of whom Brown appeared after his most recent arrest should not have released him because of his previous record. The bill would make such releases more difficult — especially for poor defendants who lack the resources to put up money for bail.
Though not likely to be terribly controversial (or impactful), one obvious downside to making pre-trial release more difficult is that many people accused of crimes are innocent. As journalists Jeffrey Billman and Michael Hewlett explained in a Sept. 21 article in The Assembly, Brown himself was acquitted during a 2024 trial in which he was prosecuted for misusing the 911 system.
But more to the point, of course is the obvious and largely unaddressed fact of Brown’s mental illness. As Billman and Hewlett detailed, Brown’s story is a tragic and sadly familiar one of a person with serious mental health problems that have ebbed and flowed and who bounced in and out of treatment and left his family grasping for solutions.
And despite this fact, and the fact that the state’s jails, prisons, courts and mental health facilities have long been overcrowded and understaffed with grossly underpaid employees, the bill sponsors are proposing no new funding to improve these systems (or, God forbid, strengthening state laws to target the tool used in the overwhelming majority of North Carolina homicides: easy-to-access firearms.)
Instead, as NC Newsline reported, they’re advancing provisions to keep people merely accused of crimes in jail longer, proposing to jumpstart the state’s long dormant death penalty (as if the threat of that could somehow have deterred a person as disturbed as Brown), using the murder to boost the U.S. Senate campaign of Trump minion Michael Whatley with demonstrably false accusations against former Gov. Roy Cooper, and perhaps most disturbingly, invoking a tool from President Donald Trump’s race card playbook.
Just a few days after Zarutska’s killing, state Senate Republican leader Phil Berger and Whatley appeared at a press conference to, among other things, all but blame the murder on Cooper’s establishment of a task force in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd charged with addressing racial inequities in the justice system. Attempting to link the task force’s work to the decision of the magistrate’s action in Brown’s case, Berger made the absurd claim that Zarutska’s murder was the result of “atrocious policies pushed by out of touch politicians and court officials” that prioritize a “perverted vision” of equity and social justice.
In other words, Berger, Whatley and company are adhering to the longstanding GOP strategy on crime (occasionally mimicked by cynical Democrats) that traces back to Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan of stoking fears of suburban and rural white voters by making bogus connections to “soft” (i.e. urban, Black and liberal) officials and policies rather than tackling real solutions like dramatically improving our justice, social safety net and mental health systems. Never mind that, as The Assembly article documents, the murder rates in Berger’s overwhelming white, rural conservative home county of Rockingham (and 30 others) exceed that in Mecklenburg.
The likely results: little meaningful change of any kind — except for a handful of poor criminal defendants who will likely find it harder avail themselves of the constitutional presumption of innocence, and new confirmation that in a state whose official motto is “to be rather than to seem,” when it comes to crime, it’s clearly the top priority of conservative political leaders to do the precise opposite.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/berger-whatley-hall-copy.jpg,,,2025-09-23 05:57:12.155442

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Early voting in Virginia began just last week, but the first wave of ballots already shows Republican-leaning House of Delegates districts pulling ahead of their Democratic counterparts.
Virginia’s early voting season begins Friday, ushering in pivotal election

Of the 20 districts with the highest number of ballots cast so far, 11 are strongly Republican or lean Republican, five are strongly Democratic, and four are competitive, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.
In total, 35,224 votes had been cast statewide as of Monday, nearly all of them in person. Fewer than 1,000 ballots were cast by mail. And while Virginia does not register voters by party, the early figures could be a sign of stronger Republican enthusiasm heading into a pivotal election year.
Republican leaders said the numbers reflect a deliberate strategy to make early voting a priority, a reversal from 2020 when skepticism of the practice pervaded the party.
“It’s definitely a Republican strategy, and I would say it goes back several years,” said Mark Peake, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia. 
“Actually, Donald Trump did not like early voting in 2020 when we think the Democrats used mail-in ballots to go harvest a lot of votes, but since that time, it’s been widely acknowledged by the RNC, the RPV, and Republicans, in general in Virginia, that we can’t wait. We can’t wait until Election Day and give the Democrats 45 days of early voting, and we just show up on Election Day.”
Peake said the party has made “a concerted effort to get out there,” describing it as a “huge part of RPV strategy to contact less likely voters and to get them motivated, to get them out early and to get all Republican voters out early.” 
The early results, he argued, show that “our strategy is paying off.”
The largest number of early ballots has come from House District 71, a politically competitive stretch of James City and New Kent counties that also includes Williamsburg. 
The district has seen a changing electorate in recent years: Former Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly won the district in 2024 with 51.5%, and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican Hung Cao there last year, 52.3 to 47.5%. But Gov. Glenn Youngkin won the same area in 2021 by nearly eight points, and Republicans have often run strong here.
Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City, is seeking reelection in the district, which she has represented since 2019. Batten chairs the House Republican Caucus and also leads the so-called “Purple Caucus,” an informal group of GOP members from politically vulnerable districts. She previously worked for Republican leaders in the General Assembly.

Her Democratic challenger, Jessica Anderson of Newport News, has a background in education and has raised slightly more campaign money than the incumbent so far: $356,915 to Batten’s $305,863.
Peake said the early voting surge in Batten’s district is “a great sign” for her. 
“I think Amanda’s going to win that seat, we feel very confident about her winning,” he said. “She’s going to win that seat. And then we’re going to win back at least two more to take over the House.”
But political analysts urged caution in reading too much into the early numbers.
“The results from the first day of voting are interesting, albeit it is very much just a snapshot,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg.
“Several things struck me, the biggest was a strong turnout in Republican lean districts, and the lower turnout in Democratic strongholds,” Richards added. “One can read this in several ways — Republicans are getting their base out early to vote, and it is showing up in GOP-led areas. On the other hand, Democrats in GOP strongholds may be extra motivated to get out early to make sure they cast their ballot.”
But Richards also said the data could signal “trouble for the Democrats if their base is not feeling as motivated to vote, or feels that they will win easily, and so voting is not essential.”
Early voting has become a centerpiece of Virginia’s elections since lawmakers expanded access in 2020. The state now allows any registered voter to cast a ballot in person up to 45 days before Election Day without providing a reason. Absentee voting by mail is also widely available.
This year, early voting began on Friday, Sept. 19 and will continue through Nov. 1, two days before Election Day. Voters can also request and return mail-in ballots, though the share of votes cast that way remains relatively small.
Peake credited part of the GOP’s turnout edge to Youngkin’s “Secure the Vote” campaign, launched through an executive order earlier this month. The initiative directs state agencies to encourage participation in early voting while promoting ballot security.
“This also ties in with Gov. Youngkin’s campaign,” Peake said. “He has been advertising that. And the RPV in conjunction with him has been advertising to secure your vote, which is encouraging Republicans to get out and vote from now until Election Day, and it is working.”
Youngkin has said the program is about giving Virginians confidence in the election process. 
“We must ensure that every legal vote is counted and that voters know their voices will be heard,” the governor said in announcing the effort. “Secure the Vote will help give voters the confidence to cast their ballots early, securely, and without hesitation.”
Youngkin signed his order just as the U.S. Department of Justice was confirmed to be sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, as reported by Stateline.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

His directive instructs the Virginia Department of Elections and its commissioner to cooperate with federal agencies to identify noncitizens on the state’s voter list using tools like the SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) database.
Lamont Bagby, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, pushed back on the idea that Republicans are running ahead. He said in a phone interview Monday that the available numbers “appear to be incomplete because not everyone has reported,” but emphasized that “every indication that I’m getting is that Democrats have outperformed 2021.” 
Bagby added that what he has seen so far suggests a roughly “2 to 1” margin of Democrats to Republicans in early votes. “I’m thrilled about the excitement I’m seeing when I go to the polls,” he said, while cautioning that “we have a ton of work to do over the next 45 days.”
Democrats have historically leaned on mobilizing voters closer to Election Day, often through labor unions, grassroots networks and get-out-the-vote drives in urban centers. But some strategists worry that the GOP’s embrace of early voting could erode what has traditionally been a Democratic edge in absentee and early ballots.
With more than a month of early voting still ahead, both parties will have opportunities to shape turnout. Republicans see the early surge as vindication of their outreach, while Democrats insist their base will show up in large numbers as the election nears.
For now, analysts say the safest conclusion is that Virginians are taking advantage of their expanded voting options — and that both parties are recalibrating how they approach an election season that increasingly stretches across nearly two months.
“What will be really interesting to see is if the pattern holds over the next six weeks and how early voting in general plays out,” Richards said. “A strong first day might mean a record turnout for an off-off-year election.”

The credits will expire at the end of the year unless Congress renews them.
About 400,000 Virginians purchase health insurance through the state’s exchange, and some of those people qualify for Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, which were established in 2021, extended in 2022 and apply to people that earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. About 100,000 Virginians are expected to lose marketplace coverage, the state exchange’s director said.
Aetna has already pulled out of the marketplace and other insurers’ rates are expected to rise. Those who don’t have employer-provided insurance will renew or shop for new health plans this fall. 
Alexandria resident and cancer survivor Laura Packard, who joined lawmakers on the call Monday, explained how her status as a small business owner means ACA marketplace is how she  keeps her health care covered. It also saved her life when getting treatment to put her cancer in remission. 
Packard noted that she is among those waiting to learn how much their premiums will rise. And while healthy people might choose to forgo health care in the interim if the price is too high, her status as a cancer survivor means she can’t exercise that option. 
“Millions of people are going through this right now,” she said.
Congress has until the end of this month to pass spending legislation and formally fund the government for the 2026 fiscal year and avoid a government shutdown. Democrats are hoping to ensure the tax credits are extended permanently as Republicans present a spectrum of views on the matter. 
With the GOP in control of Congress, addressing the credits could have been handled when passing the reconciliation bill they dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, but it wasn’t included in the measure.
In lieu of cancelling the credits altogether, some Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, are pushing for a one-year extension of the credits. But Kiggans told Politico that she won’t force a government shutdown over the matter.

Democrats introduced a proposal at the start of the year to permanently extend the credits. 
“Obviously, a one year extension is better than nothing,” U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said on the press call. 
Scott said that Kiggans’ idea is a way to buy political cover ahead of next year’s congressional midterm elections — which will be shaped in part by the controversial health care changes that stem from the OBBBA. 
Those health care-related adjustments include changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid processes. Hospital systems and health care advocates have emphasized that thousands of people are expected to lose that form of health coverage and place some hospitals in the vulnerable position of reducing services or closures. The strain is expected to eventually pass onto private insurers who will raise rates. 
“It just protects people from the immediate aftermath of inflicting this damage on the American people,” Scott said. “The problem was created by the failure to include (tax credit extensions) in the ‘One, Big Ugly Bill.’”
As rural and Republican-represented districts often include large portions of Medicaid recipients, Democrats have warned throughout the summer that their constituents may be among the hardest hit by negative impacts. 
Six hospitals in Virginia are suspected to be most vulnerable to closures or service cuts while three health clinics in Shenandoah Valley closed recently with their owners, Augusta Health, citing the reconciliation bill as a factor. 
In reframing the OBBBA as the “Working Families Tax Cut Act,” President Donald Trump’s administration announced applications for the Rural Health
Virginia, other states can now tap into $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Fund

Transformation Fund last week. The fund emerged amid debates about the reconciliation bill this summer and is expected to give a boost to rural areas.
“We think we have an opportunity not just to plug a few of the holes, but to transform in a lasting way the rural health care system in this country,” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz said last week of the fund, which comprises a $50 billion dollar investment over the next five years. 
If their applications are accepted, states can direct funding towards things like workforce investment or upgrades to information technology, Oz mentioned on that call.
But former Health Resources and Services Administration head Carole Johnson called that fund a “band-aid” for larger problems that was used as a “political solution” to get the reconciliation bill through.
Meanwhile, both parties in Congress have put forth failed continuing resolutions to avoid a government shutdown while they resolve their differences. 
When Democrats on Monday’s call were asked if they were willing to let the government shut down in the weeks ahead, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, reiterated that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)On September 27th, 2024, floodwaters from Hurricane Helene that had already devastated North Carolina rushed through the hills and hollers of Southwest Virginia, uprooting timber, agriculture land, homes and businesses. The impact on the region’s natural resources can still be seen today.
“It was a storm to the level that nobody really alive had ever seen before. I think the last time that there had been a flood, particularly of the New River, of this magnitude was in 1940,” said Kevin Spurlin, an agriculture and natural resource agent with the Virginia Cooperative Extension.
Spurlin serves the Grayson County region that was hit hard by floodwaters and winds that took down trees and carried debris into smaller streams from the New River – which reached 31 feet in some places. The fierce flooding changed the flow of some of the streams in the area, Spurlin said, which impacted how infrastructure like bridges had to be engineered and rebuilt.
“Especially where there were curves or bends in the river, it would just kind of wash straight across and cut a whole new channel that kind of went straight down and almost isolated those curves,” Spurlin said.
Virginia farms were estimated to have $159 million in damage from the storm. Spurlin said many farmers saw forestland they considered their road to retirement washed away or razed in the wind. Some farmers have struggled to even access more remote parts of their land to clear away the debris, a year later.

Extensive recovery efforts have already taken place in some parts of Grayson and surveying the county now, it could be difficult to tell that Helene ravaged the area only a year ago. But some spots remain permanently altered by the floodwaters.
“There’s areas that will never be back the way they were. There might have been 10 to15 feet of stream bank or river bank that’s just gone,” Spurlin said.
Fencing erected as part of voluntary conservation programs used to keep cattle out of waterways incurred some of the worst storm damage in the county. The fences would act as a net for debris coming down the streams but worsened flooding in some spots. Spurlin said new methods are being explored to help prevent that from being an issue in future storms.
“We’re actually looking at exploring the use of virtual fencing, being able to use GPS collars on livestock instead of having a physical structure along a stream bank,” Spurlin said. 
To the west of Grayson County is the town of Damascus,  is a key destination for many hikers and bikers who travel to the region. 
The popular Virginia Creeper Trail that stretches from White Top to Abingdon draws hundreds of bicyclists to Damascus to ride part of the trail. The most popular portion is the ride from White Top to Damascus – that was almost completely washed out in the storm. It is estimated that it will be at least another year before the trail is rebuilt. Route 58 was totally washed out from the Laurel Creek flooding in the town.
“It’s hard to believe on this beautiful afternoon that last year I was fishing, not on the creek behind me, but literally scooping fish off the asphalt of Route 58.” Damascus town manager Chris Bell said.
The Virginia Creeper Trail’s rebuild will cost an estimated $200-300 million and is projected to be completed in October 2026. Companies are bidding now for the chance to helm the project.

Damascus city leaders are using grant funding to create a flood mitigation plan to prevent future  devastation. Bell said there was some work done along the Laurel Creek after a major flood in the 70s but not much was done for other vulnerable points along the water’s edge.
“Looking at bridge design, water flow, when they rebuild the Creeper Trail, when they’re rebuilding the bridge on Orchard Hill Road, those are the things the engineers are considering to allow water to flow and the water needs to flow,” Bell said.
In Damascus, 140 structures were damaged or destroyed – bringing an estimated $12 million in damages to residential properties, businesses and public facilities. Virginia endured an estimated $4 billion in damage and hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of debris were strewn across the region. Three people in Virginia died as a result of the storm, as well as over 250 people in other states.
The flooding in Damascus was, in part, due to debris building up on bridges and trestles that crossed the creeks. Once the weight was too much, the trestle or bridge would break, sending the onslaught of water and debris down stream. Bell said there is work being done to design new trestles that will allow better water flow,since they no longer have to support the weight of trains crossing over them.
The U.S. The Department of Agriculture is working with localities in the region to help restore the waterways that were impacted by the flooding.
“Several waterways near the Town of Damascus suffered major impairments. They ranged from complete waterway blockages due to cobble and woody debris to significant stream bank erosion. Following the storm, NRCS is working with 11 local governments, providing a total of $20 million in assistance through the Emergency Watershed Protection program,” said USDA spokesman Jefferey Blakly.
While Virginia did not see the level of mudslides that drastically changed its mountainsides, which did occur in North Carolina, there are still many changes on the local level that will require ingenuity, from rebuilding bridges to redesigning popular trails. Farmers are continuing repairs to their land and seeking new technology to better prepare for major storms on the horizon.
“Nature has a way of healing itself,” Spurlin said.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0272-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-23 05:57:12.155442

The company is also welcoming the return of the Amtrak Step-Up Program, offering additional travel options. 
The Long Bridge Project, once completed by 2030, will enable more freight and passenger rail service by separating the lines between Washington, D.C. and Virginia. The current two-track system, widely regarded as a bottleneck, has negatively impacted travel times.
The estimated cost of the entire Long Bridge Project is $2.3 billion.

“The Long Bridge Project is one of the largest railroad construction projects undertaken in the commonwealth in years,” the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority said in a statement to the Mercury. “This new two-track railroad bridge is currently under construction and will increase rail capacity across the Potomac River. Its completion will mean generational changes in passenger rail for Virginians.” 
Beginning in January, the four VRE trains to terminate at Alexandria will be the last four morning trains, two on the Manassas line and two on the Fredericksburg line. Travelers can also transfer to using Metro’s rail service in Alexandria.
No VRE trains will be eliminated, according to the commuter rail service, adding that planners may refine service adjustments over the 2026-2030 project period.
Amtrak Virginia will also implement temporary service changes, expanding its list of combined roundtrips on train and bus in Virginia from five to six. The list of daily round-trip trains includes four trains to Norfolk and Newport News, and two daily express buses to and from Hampton Roads, providing Newport News with an additional connection to Washington, D.C.
Travelers should expect slight changes in departure and arrival times.
VPRA is working to create a new service plan that accommodates current Amtrak Virginia passenger rail service and construction plans for the new Long Bridge “while remaining on time and on budget,” the authority said.
During the construction planning process, Amtrak Virginia is also reinstating its Amtrak Step-Up Program, providing VRE multi-ride ticketholders with more options to travel in and out of Union Station as early as next month. The commuter rail service suspended the program in 2020 due to how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted ridership. 
The Step-Up program will allow VRE 10-trip or monthly ticket holders to select an additional $4 “step-up” ticket through the VRE Mobile app. Riders can then hop on an Amtrak train traveling in the VRE service area instead of on a VRE train, at any time, seven days a week. Within the VRE Mobile app, riders can view the upcoming Amtrak trains and the number of available seats.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month threatening to withhold federal funding from states and localities that have adopted “cashless bail” policies, he escalated a national fight over how courts decide who should remain behind bars before trial.
The move has already rippled into state capitols. In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers are considering legislation this week that would tighten pretrial release rules after a high-profile fatal stabbing on a commuter train last month.
The bill, which was first introduced in March and altered earlier this week with the title “Iryna’s Law,” would require people to post money bail for certain offenses and would restrict judicial discretion for violent and repeat offenders. The bill also would add a new category of violent offenses that require specific pretrial conditions, such as electronic monitoring. It passed its first committee hearing Monday.
“When we were looking at drafting this bill, a lot of it was looking at the situation that happened in Charlotte,” said state Sen. Danny Britt, a Republican and criminal defense attorney, to WRAL-TV.
In New York, Republican lawmakers are pushing to advance legislation that would further limit pretrial release and allow judges to weigh a defendant’s “dangerousness” in setting conditions. New York ended bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in 2019, but has since scaled back the law at least three times to allow judges more discretion.
And in Texas — where legislators passed new bail restrictions earlier this summer — voters in November will consider a constitutional amendment banning bail altogether in certain cases for violent offenses such as murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child.
Trump signed the cashless bail order three days after Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, was killed in a seemingly random stabbing in Charlotte, North Carolina. The suspect, who has a lengthy criminal record, had been released without bond last winter after being charged with misusing the 911 system.
Trump’s order directs U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify which jurisdictions have “substantially eliminated cash bail,” though it does not define what that means — leaving its scope and enforcement unclear. Some legal experts say they expect challenges in court, as has happened with previous efforts to tie federal funding to state or local policies.
Trump issued the directive alongside another order aimed at Washington, D.C., where he declared a “crime emergency” and sought to roll back the city’s decades-old bail law. The district did not fully eliminate cash bail when it passed its Bail Reform Act in 1992, but judges are required to consider nonfinancial conditions — such as electronic monitoring, curfews or check-ins — before setting a monetary bond.
Trump’s orders are part of his broader crackdown on crime and public safety, which has also included deploying the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee; Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.
Same charge, different outcomes
Cash bail is a guarantee to show up to court: A defendant pays money and is allowed to go home. At the end of their case, they may get the money back. A judge or magistrate may set the amount based on the severity of the charge and whether the defendant is considered a flight or safety risk.
But someone unable to pay the bail, even after being charged with a low-level misdemeanor, may remain in jail for days, weeks or months. Defendants by law are presumed innocent, but stuck behind bars, they can lose jobs or housing and be unable to care for their family.
Bail clampdowns don’t match what research says about suspects, experts say

Dozens of jurisdictions, including some states, have taken steps to change their bail systems, but there is no single definition of what constitutes “bail reform” or how such changes are applied.
Some states, counties and cities have moved toward fully or nearly eliminating, cash bail. Under these “cashless bail” systems, people may be released before trial without paying money unless a judge determines they pose a public safety risk or are unlikely to return to court. These decisions, experts say, are made intentionally, based on the facts of the case — including the charges involved — rather than on a defendant’s ability to pay.
The policies can affect a large share of the people in the justice system. About 5 million felony cases and 13 million misdemeanor cases are resolved in state courts each year, according to the National Center for State Courts. Since misdemeanors make up the bulk of cases, state and local bail policies can shape outcomes for millions of people charged with lower-level offenses.
Some opponents of cashless bail policies argue that lenient policies may result in the release of defendants who could reoffend or fail to appear. Supporters counter that keeping people in jail simply because they cannot afford bail is unfair and disproportionately affects Black, Latino and low-income defendants.
The ongoing debate has fueled misconceptions, partly because some news coverage repeats unproven claims that cashless bail policies cause upticks in crime.
Trump has frequently drawn that connection himself. In a July post on Truth Social, he wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Supporters of cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, some research suggests that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime. Some research also suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety.
How the bail system works
Washington, D.C., the immediate target of Trump’s executive orders, largely eliminated the use of cash bail in 1992. Judges are required to first consider nonfinancial conditions, such as check-ins or curfews, though cash bail may still be used in serious cases.
Several states also have adopted major changes. Alaska, California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York have passed laws scaling back or fully eliminating cash bail, though some of those laws have since been revised. New Mexico voters in 2016 also overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to eliminate cash bail.
 In 2023, Illinois became the first state to fully abolish cash bail through the Pretrial Fairness Act, which also guarantees defendants legal representation at pretrial hearings.
 “Those early decisions about someone’s liberty are much more deliberative,” said Don Steman, a professor and co-director of the Center for Criminal Justice at Loyola University Chicago. The center’s team has been evaluating the implementation and impact of the Pretrial Fairness Act. “It’s about, ‘Is this person a threat to public safety or a threat to willful flight?’”
In Houston, a 2019 settlement and consent decree resolved a lawsuit challenging Harris County’s misdemeanor bail practices as unconstitutional, requiring the county to release most people charged with misdemeanors on a personal promise to return to court.
In the latest independent monitoring report, from 2024, observers wrote that the changes “have saved Harris County and residents many millions of dollars, improved the lives of tens of thousands of persons,” and resulted in “no increase in new offenses by persons arrested for misdemeanors.”
In August, just a day after Trump issued his executive order, Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton asked a federal court to vacate the consent decree.
He argued that the order conflicts with a Texas law passed in 2021 and another state bail law that took effect this month. Those laws require people charged with violent crimes in Texas to post cash bail in order to be released from jail, and expand the list of offenses for which defendants must post a cash bond, respectively.
Bail policies and crime
Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022 both in jurisdictions that have adopted cashless bail and in those that have not, though some communities continue to face higher rates of certain offenses, including homicide.
Pretrial crime accounts for only a small share of overall crime. And experts say most crime data is too unreliable to link changes in crime rates to any single policy.
“It’s just so difficult to say this policy equals this result when crime is going up and down so dramatically as it has over the last decade,” said Jeff Clayton, the executive director of the American Bail Coalition, a bail industry lobbying group.
Even so, some research has provided insight.
In Illinois, which eliminate cash bail entirely in 2023, reported crime across the state fell 11% in the first six months after the law took effect compared with the same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by the Loyola University Chicago’s Center for Criminal Justice. Violent crime dropped 7%, while property crime fell 14%, according to the center’s report.
The declines were seen in both rural counties and in Cook County, though not in every part of the state. Researchers cautioned that the drop in crime cannot be directly tied to the law, but noted in the report that the data shows there was no immediate surge in crime after cash bail ended in the state.
A 2024 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law, found “no statistically significant relationship” between bail policies and crime rates. The report, which is not peer-reviewed, analyzed data from 33 U.S. cities between 2015 and 2021, 22 of which had made changes to their bail systems.
Similarly, a 2023 peer-reviewed research paper published in the American Economic Journal found no evidence in a review of cases in Philadelphia that cash bail improves court appearance rates or reduces crime among people released before trial.
Cash bail policies are under fresh scrutiny

The White House pointed to a 2022 report from the district attorney’s office in Yolo County, California, to support Trump’s claims, the Associated Press reported.
The report examined how a temporary “zero bail” system, put in place statewide during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce crowding in jails, affected recidivism. It found that out of 595 people released between April 2020 and May 2021, about 71% were arrested again, and more than half were rearrested multiple times.
A follow-up review, released in early 2023, compared recidivism over an 18-month period in Yolo County for two groups: 100 people released on bail in 2018-2019 and 100 people released under the zero bail policy in 2020-2021. The tally found higher rearrest rates among the zero-bail group.
Some experts, however, say those district attorney reports have serious limitations. They compared groups of defendants charged with different types of offenses. And the zero bail releases during COVID-19 were emergency measures to ease jail crowding: People were released without conditions and without any risk assessment, unlike under typical cashless bail systems.
What comes next
With his executive orders, Trump has taken the unprecedented step of attempting to condition federal funding on how states and cities handle bail.
Some legal experts say the orders are likely to face challenges in court, though it is not yet clear how or when those challenges will arise. It is also unclear which federal grants could be affected, or how the federal justice department will define cashless bail and determine which jurisdictions are covered.
Some legal experts also say the orders raise two major constitutional issues. First, they conflict with principles of federalism, which give states and local governments broad authority to design their own criminal justice systems, as long as they comply with constitutional requirements. Second, they argue the orders may violate the Tenth Amendment, which says that powers not granted to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people.
Another concern is that the orders may exceed the president’s authority by encroaching on Congress’s spending power. Only Congress can decide how federal money is spent and attach conditions to that funding, and there is no law currently that allows states to lose federal funds because of their bail policies.
“The president doesn’t have the authority to say, ‘I’m going to impose that condition because I think that’s what the law should be,’” said David Gans, the director of the human rights, civil rights and citizenship program at the Constitutional Accountability Center. “The president is kind of trying to take those decisions away from states.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)One of the main ways President Donald Trump’s signature law will save billions in the Medicaid program is through new work requirements. An analysis released Thursday said they will put a big dent in Ohio hospital revenues while increasing the cost of caring for newly uninsured patients.
The analysis, by the Commonwealth Fund, said that across the country, rural hospitals and those that care for a large share of the poor will be hardest hit.
Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending — including about $33 billion in Ohio — over the next 10 years. It also cuts $230 billion in federal food assistance over the same period. 
At the same time, the law gives $1 trillion in tax cuts to the richest 1%. It also balloons the deficit by $3.4 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
One of the biggest ways the Trump law will cut Medicaid spending is through work mandates, which will take effect just after next year’s midterm elections. 
The work requirements are being imposed even though 92% of non-disabled Medicaid recipients under 65 are either working, or couldn’t work due to caregiving responsibilities, or were ill, or were in school.

When work requirements were tried in Arkansas, they didn’t achieve their goal — if it truly was to get able-bodied recipients off of Medicaid and into jobs. 
A quarter of the population subject to the requirement lost coverage, as the state saw “an increase in the percentage of adults who were uninsured, and no significant change in employment—as nearly everyone targeted by the policy met the requirements already or qualified for an exemption,” KFF reported.
As new Medicaid requirements loom, one Ohio recipient warns the complicated system will get worse

That might have happened because Medicaid recipients say they’re already subject to lots of confusing rules, and the Arkansas experiment simply hassled many eligible residents off of the system.
Hardest hit by the work requirement will be the 40 states — including Ohio — that expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act to cover low-income adults, the Commonwealth Fund report said.
“Hospitals in Medicaid expansion states could see operating margins reduced by an average of 11.7 percent to 13.3 percent,” the report said.
Rural hospitals and those with a big share of poor patients are already struggling due to insufficient Medicaid reimbursements, having to care for a high mix of uninsured patients and increasing costs. 
The Commonwealth Fund report said they’ll be particularly hard hit by the new work requirements.
“Between 5.1 million and 5.8 million people could lose their Medicaid coverage and become uninsured as a result of the federal work requirements,” the report said.
 “The 2027 implementation date means that states may not have sufficient time to modify their systems to automatically verify whether people are employed or exempt at the same rates seen previously in Arkansas and New Hampshire. Without this infrastructure, many Medicaid expansion enrollees will be forced to manually verify their community engagement activity or exemption status, increasing the likelihood that eligible people will lose coverage because of the reporting process.”
Ohio’s rural hospitals seem particularly vulnerable. 
The Ohio Hospital Association in May told the legislature that half of Ohio hospitals and 72% of rural hospitals have reported operating losses since 2022.
The Commonwealth Fund report said that under the new Medicaid work requirements, rural hospitals’ operating margins will decline by 28.8% to 32.8%. 
In addition, the state’s safety-net hospitals will lose between 7.4% and 8.4% in Medicaid revenue under the law, the report said.
Ohio Hospital Association praises senators, won’t say if their vote cost hospitals billions

The Ohio Hospital Association has declined to say whether the state’s hospitals will gain or lose money under the provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It didn’t immediately respond to questions for this story.
The Commonwealth Fund report estimates that the great majority of those who lose Medicaid coverage will become uninsured. 
Emergency rooms are required by law to treat people, regardless of their ability to pay. So as the number of uninsured patients goes up, so does the cost of uncompensated care hospitals have to provide.
Rural hospitals in Ohio will see uncompensated-care costs increase between 19.2% and 21.7%, the report said. 
Safety-net hospitals in the state will see a corresponding increase of 16% to 18.1%, it said.
The organization representing Ohio emergency doctors has warned that the losses in revenue and increased costs will affect all patients. 
Hospitals will have to make cuts elsewhere, resulting in longer wait times, increased prices and decreased services, it said.
The Commonwealth Fund said the effects will radiate into the broader community.
“Alongside impacting hospital and Medicaid enrollees, the work requirement policy also will affect each hospital’s surrounding community, particularly hospitals in poor or rural areas,” it said. 
“The combined effects of Medicaid work requirements on safety net hospitals and community health centers could leave communities with little to no access to primary, specialty, or emergency care, significantly increasing travel times for routine and emergency health needs.”

(Courtesy of New Hampshire Housing)New Hampshire’s housing market has an income gap problem.
The median household income has doubled since 1998, hovering at just under $100,000 today. But home prices have jumped at a much faster rate. 
Back in 1998, the median New Hampshire home was 2.8 times more expensive than the median income could afford, according to an analysis by New Hampshire Housing, a state-supported housing organization. Today, that same median home is 5.5 times more expensive.
The result is a yawning gap in affordability that appears to only be increasing. It’s a divide that dominated a discussion on the future of housing hosted by the New Hampshire Business Review Thursday. 
“The gap between what households earn and what homes cost in New Hampshire has never been wider,” said Heather McCann, managing director of engagement, policy, and communications at New Hampshire Housing. 
Economists generally advise households to spend no more than 30% of their gross income on housing. But the prices in New Hampshire make that advice difficult for all but a few in the state to follow.
For instance, in order to afford New Hampshire’s median house price by paying no more than 5% in a down payment and no more than 30% of income a year on a mortgage, a New Hampshire family would need to make $182,000 a year, McCann said. For one person with a full-time job, that averages out to about $88 an hour.
But in reality, the median household in New Hampshire makes $95,628, not $182,000. That means only about 15% of New Hampshire residents could comfortably afford that median home price, according to New Hampshire Housing. 
And while the incomes have steadily risen in the last two decades, they have hardly kept pace with housing costs.
Analysts in New Hampshire have struggled to paint a clear picture about where the New Hampshire housing market is going this year. But one underlying factor has stubbornly persisted: low supply.

Rents are continuing to rise after climbing about 35% in the last five years, McCann noted. And because home prices are still high, many individuals and families are staying in rental units, unable to leave, even while the rents rise, she said.
The climbing prices has become a vicious circle for young people in the state, forcing some to leave, McCann said. But retirees are facing increasingly difficult conditions, too. With Social Security paying an average of $2,000 per month, many older residents are paying for too high a portion of that toward their housing.
Rents tend to crowd out other priorities such as food, transportation, and health care, she said.
New Hampshire’s post-pandemic boom may have slowed, but it has not stopped. In August, the median sales price hit $550,000 in the state. That was a massive increase from just years earlier; the median price was just over $300,000 in 2019. But that increase was not followed by a similar increase in income for Granite Staters.
The price increases have been slowing: While year-to-year growth in the year following the COVID-19 pandemic saw home prices climbing by around 20% a year, this year, they are higher than last year by only about 2%, McCann said. But the current price levels are still far above what most Granite Staters can afford.
One key metric to assess the housing market is the average time homes stay on the market before they are sold. A short time period indicates a continued buying frenzy, which means prices are liable to rise or stay high.
At the current rate, the total number of New Hampshire’s listed homes could be sold in 2½ months. That is nowhere near the six-month timeframe that housing economists say would indicate a healthy market. 
Meanwhile, the houses that are selling more slowly are more likely to be newly constructed. It would take 4.4 months to sell New Hampshire’s inventory of new homes, compared to 1.9 months to sell its inventory of existing homes. That suggests the new homes are more likely to be expensive, McCann said. 
The sales prices bear that out: The median price of a newly constructed home is $750,000. That price has jumped 75% compared to new home prices in 2020, driven by a combination of supply constraints, inflation, and tariffs.

The bottom line, analysts say: While housing supply may be increasing somewhat, it is not doing so quickly enough. And the housing that is being constructed is still out of reach for many buyers. Until the market cools further and prices fall, that dynamic will continue.
“Even as new homes are added to the market, they tend to be larger homes at a higher price point, and they’re just not easing the affordability pressures for the average New Hampshire household,” McCann said.
That dynamic applies to rental housing, too; while affordable housing projects are being built, many new units are luxury units. More supply — even via more expensive housing — can eventually help lower prices overall, but it is slow. In the meantime, those at the lowest end of the income spectrum continue to suffer the most, she said.
“It’s not bringing up enough units for folks to be able to afford. Prices are still going up,” she said.
Efforts toward affordability
This year, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a slew of bills meant to reduce regulatory hurdles to building housing at the state and local level. 
One, House Bill 577, would expand the rights of homeowners to build accessory dwelling units on their properties and allow for “detached” units. Another, Senate Bill 284, would prevent cities and towns from imposing requirements of more than one parking space per unit for new developments. House Bill 631 requires cities and towns to allow developers to build housing in upper floors of buildings in commercial zones, with some exceptions. And another, Senate Bill 153, would require state agencies such as the Department of Environmental Services to turn around applications for permits for new housing developments within 60 days. 
“This is quite a few very important laws that are definitely going to make a difference, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing how they’re implemented,” Ayotte said at a ceremonial signing ceremony in August. 
Any new construction assisted by the new laws will take time. A more immediate fix for struggling home buyers or renters are vouchers that are targeted to lower incomes, McCann and others say. But those vouchers cover only so many people, and go only so far. If prices increase, their usefulness is diminished.
For developers of affordable housing, the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program has proved helpful, said Greg Chakmakas, a shareholder at the law firm Sheehan Phinney, which is involved in housing development deals. 
That program allows developers of affordable housing to receive federal tax credits to offset upfront construction costs. Developers will sell the credits to investors in exchange for early funding to allow the housing construction to move ahead. In order to qualify for the tax credits, the developers must include and agree to covenants that keep the rent at an affordable level for at least 30 years. 
This year, state lawmakers passed legislation to give developers who receive those federal tax credits additional local state tax relief. Senate Bill 173 mandates that — for local property tax purposes — those properties be assessed at a value of 10% of the annual rental income for 10 years. That law will help lower the annual costs for developers of low-income housing, allowing them to set the rents lower, Chakmakas said. 
The effects of the new legal changes will take time to show. But just as the dynamic of insufficient housing supply has persisted, the unwillingness of some communities to embrace more housing has also continued, analysts note.
“There’s a lot of communities who should be commended for being welcoming to affordable housing, and they’re making a lot of strides on that front,” Chakmakas said. “And then there are other communities who want to put up a moat around their town and see nothing changed. And I think a lot of that is kind of based in fear and misconception.”
Those towns that have allowed affordable housing to be built have been happy in the end, Chakmakas argued. 
McCann said New Hampshire Housing is aware of continuing resistance and has an advocacy team that seeks to convince local leaders and residents that housing could be a boon for their town.
“Affordable homes just aren’t about individual households,” she said. “They’re about the health of an entire community and state. So when people can find housing that they can afford, local businesses can attract and keep workers, schools and services remain strong, older residents can stay in the communities that they helped build.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NH-Housing-stats-1-1024x569.png,,,2025-09-23 05:57:12.155442

(Photo by Aaron Marco for KFF Health News)Every day for nearly 18 years, Alessandra Fabrello has been a medical caregiver for her son, on top of being his mom.
“It is almost impossible to explain what it takes to keep a child alive who should be dead,” said Fabrello, whose son, Ysadore Maklakoff, experienced a rare brain condition called acute necrotizing encephalopathy at 9 months old.
Through North Carolina’s Medicaid program, Maklakoff qualifies for a large slate of medical care in the family’s home in Chapel Hill. Fabrello said she works with staffing agencies to arrange services. She also learned to give the care ordinarily performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist because she often can’t get help.
Now, broad cuts to North Carolina Medicaid will make finding and paying for care even more difficult.
Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state’s biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump’s hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade.
North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors, and caregivers.
In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates. In Washington state, lawmakers approved cuts to the program that will not affect who is eligible, said Hayden Mackley, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Financial Management.
Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.
North Carolina’s Medicaid agency announced it will institute on Oct. 1 a minimum 3% reduction in pay for all providers who treat Medicaid patients. Primary care doctors face an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop in payments, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Fabrello said her son’s dentist already called to say the office will not accept Medicaid patients come November. Fabrello fears dental work will become another service her son qualifies for but can’t get because there aren’t enough providers who accept Medicaid coverage.
Occupational and speech therapy, nursing care, and respite care are all difficult or impossible to get, she said. In a good week, her son will get 50 hours of skilled nursing care out of the 112 hours he qualifies for.
“When you say, ‘We’re just cutting provider rates,’ you’re actually cutting access for him for all his needs,” Fabrello said.
Shannon Dowler, former chief medical officer for North Carolina Medicaid, said that reduced payments to dentists and other providers will lower the number of providers in the state’s Medicaid network and result in “an immediate loss of access to care, worse outcomes, and cause higher downstream costs.”
The imminent cuts in North Carolina “don’t have anything to do” with the new federal law that cuts Medicaid funding, Dowler said.
“This is like the layers of the onion,” she said. “We are hurting ourselves in North Carolina way ahead of the game, way before we need to do this.” North Carolina alone is projected to lose about $23 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade.
More than 3 million North Carolinians are enrolled in Medicaid. Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.
“We all hope it changes,” Dowler said, adding that if it does not, “you’re going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members.”

Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina’s Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the covid-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.
But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.
“It’s a difficult moment for North Carolina,” said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is “absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state.”
For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the “most vulnerable in our community.”
Western North Carolina Community Health Services’ three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.
Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates 4% across the board.
The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a recent op-ed in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75% to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to “to reduce staff or accept fewer residents.”
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted 19% growth in Medicaid spending this year.

The Idaho Hospital Association’s Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization’s chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days’ cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days’ cash or less, she said.
“Hopefully, none of them will close,” Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.
Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state’s general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.
States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.
Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.
In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until North Carolina began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She’s received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.
Now, if the state reductions go through, she faces a salary cut.
“As parents, we are indispensable lifelines to our children, and we are struggling to fight for our own survival on top of it,” Fabrello said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-23 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Does the Connecticut Sun help the local economy? It’s complicated,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/23/connecticut-sun-economic-development-hartford-wnba/,Some want the WNBA's CT Sun to play in Hartford's newly refurbished arena. But the potential economic benefits are unclear.,"For weeks, discussions of sports in Connecticut have largely revolved around one question: Will the Connecticut Sun, the state’s foremost major league team, stay in the state? 
The news last month that the WNBA team, which has been owned by the Mohegan Tribe since 2003, might be sold to Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca for $325 million sparked a flood of concern and an equally intense flurry of activity. 
That concern turned into outrage as the proposed Boston sale and a separate counteroffer, which would keep the team in state but move it to Hartford, were both  ignored by the WNBA as it considers sending the team elsewhere. U.S. Senator, and former state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal went so far as to raise antitrust concerns.
State officials swiftly launched a campaign calling for the Sun to stay in Connecticut and urging residents to sign a petition to help make the case to the league. 
Connecticut officials are also considering a plan that would see the state use pension funds to purchase a minority stake in the Sun in order to keep the team. While the proposal has received support from Gov. Ned Lamont, the possible use of pension funds has drawn criticism from both legislative Republicans and unions; Both argue there are better uses for the money. 
“There needs to be structure and fiscal responsibility and a level of respect for taxpayer money and for public employees’ money,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said at a press conference last week. 
So far everything is still in the air. The WNBA has not made a decision, and much of the public debate is based on potential situations rather than any agreed upon plan. There is no clear timetable for when a decision on the Sun’s fate will be made.  
But the discussion has raised questions, not just around the team’s future, but also around its value to Connecticut and the power of the team as a catalyst for economic development in the state. With two options on the table that could see the Sun playing home games in Hartford, there’s also a question of how much the city and surrounding region would gain. 
It’s a complicated thing to consider, requiring an understanding of the WNBA’s recent growth, as well as how sports and local economies feed off of one another. And much like the broader discussions of the Sun to this point, experts say finding an exact answer is somewhat murky.
The WNBA has exploded in popularity. Team valuations reflect that
One thing that’s clearer is the rise of the WNBA as a major sports league. Professional women’s basketball has come a long way from the early 2000s, when the Mohegan Tribe first purchased the then-Orlando Miracle for just $10 million. 
In recent years, the league has grown considerably, expanding the number of teams and seeing an explosion of popularity as players draw attention on and off the court. That’s spurred increased merchandise sales, higher TV ratings and larger audiences. In 2025, women’s basketball is expected to generate some $1 billion in revenue, up from the $710 million it generated in 2024. 
That success has had a notable impact on the economics of the WNBA, especially around player wages and team valuations. A recent study from Sportico, a digital content company, found that team valuations have increased an average of 180% over the last year. 
“Valuations are incredibly high,” said Ceyda Mumcu, an expert in sports marketing and fan behavior at the University of New Haven. “And there are certainly individuals looking at women’s sports franchises as investment options.”
The Sun has benefited from this growth. As recently as 2022, the team’s attendance was in the top half of the league, averaging roughly 5,712 visitors per game. In 2025, that number soared to an average of roughly 8,653 attendees per game, though the attendance figures now — at the close of a lackluster season — place the Sun closer to the bottom of the league rankings. 
The Sun also successfully sold out TD Garden in Boston, when the team played single games there in 2024 and 2025, adding support to the proposed move to Boston and demonstrating the strength of the regional New England audience for women’s basketball. According to Sportico’s analysis, the team is now worth 18 times what the Mohegan Tribe paid in 2003. And it could sell for nearly twice that.
Sports economists say that some of this success is to be expected. “The WNBA has gone through exactly the same stages of development that the NBA went through,” said David Berri, an economics professor at Southern Utah University and co-author of “Slaying the Trolls! Why the Trolls Are Very, Very Wrong about Women and Sports.”
“It usually takes three or four decades for a professional sports league made up of teams to gain an audience,” Berri added. “That was true of the NBA, that was true of the NFL, that was true of Major League Baseball, and now it’s true of the WNBA.”
Hartford shoots its shot
Even if the league’s growing popularity is part of why its leaders might be interested in moving the Sun to a larger market, supporters of keeping the team in Connecticut say the WNBA’s push is difficult to accept. 
The frustrations are perhaps even more compounded for fans in Hartford, who could benefit from the two proposals to keep the Sun in state — particularly the counteroffer deal backed by former Milwaukee Bucks owner Mike Lasry, which reportedly would include a new practice facility in the area. 
Local economic development experts noted that the city has had a decades-long drought of major league sports team activity in the wake of the Hartford Whalers exit in 1997. Previous efforts to attract an established sports franchise, including a doomed bid for the New England Patriots in 1999, have not worked out.
Dustin Nord, director of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association’s Foundation for Economic Growth and Opportunity, said even now people tell him that “the worst thing to happen to Connecticut was when the Whalers left — and this is 30 years after the fact.”
“I think it’s very clear that these types of decisions have ripple effects well into the future for generations of people,” Nord said.
In August, Nord wrote a blog post supporting the idea of moving the Connecticut Sun to Hartford, arguing that “Connecticut needs sports, and the squads that decide to come here do so with resounding success.” 
In an interview earlier this month, Nord further explained how a major league team could fit into the city, noting that Hartford already supports multiple UConn basketball games and that minor league sports have had an impact.

UConn athletics alone have had some effect in the regional economy. According to its annual athletic impact report for 2022-23, UConn’s sports teams supported 333 jobs in Hartford County and 1,500 jobs throughout the state. Visitor and fan spending as a result of UConn athletics generated $32.3 million in statewide economic output and $8.3 million in Hartford County as the result of “direct, indirect, and induced activities,” the report found.
Connecticut’s reputation as a hot spot for women’s college basketball — a position the state has emphasized as officials make their case to the WNBA — also makes the Sun a good fit in Hartford, Nord argued. 
“We don’t have a pro sports team outside of minor league sports in Hartford or in the area,” he said. “When you compare it to a lot of other places, you could put a professional sports team, a major league, professional sports team, [and access] two and a half million people without any real competition. That’s a pretty compelling case.”
The WNBA discussions are also taking shape as downtown Hartford’s recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena nears the end of a $145 million renovation that will update the facility’s amenities and infrastructure.
Michael Freimuth, executive director of the Capital Regional Development Authority, which is overseeing the renovation effort, said if a deal is reached to bring the Sun to town, the arena will be ready. 
“Generally between late May to early September is a slow period for the arena. The WNBA fits right into that slot,” Freimuth said. “So it’s a bonus activity…it brings in additional events to the building that play out across the downtown neighborhood. It drives business in the hotels. It drives business in the restaurants. It drives business in parking garages.” 
The economic impact of sports isn’t as clear cut 
But while the prospect of moving the Sun to Hartford has drawn the support and cautious optimism of some local development experts — as well as the backing of Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam — a major economic boon to the city isn’t guaranteed. 
In the mid-2010s the city placed a bet on the Hartford Yard Goats baseball team, arguing that the team — and the roughly $60 million the city was spending on constructing a new downtown ballpark — would help spur new development in the area, including a mixed-use project with housing, a supermarket and restaurants.
By the time the park was completed, the city’s portion of the cost had ballooned to more than $70 million, in part due to delays from the initial developers tasked with the project, who later sued after being fired. The park was later finished by a different company.
Dunkin’ Park opened to significant fanfare and accolades in 2017, and has continued to see its attendance grow, with the Yard Goats drawing in hundreds of thousands of attendees last year and winning the title of Minor League Baseball’s 2024 Organization of the Year. Officials have pointed to the ballpark as a source of hope and potential boost for other development initiatives in the city, adding that the increased traffic downtown could encourage more business owners to consider moving in.
But the ballpark project didn’t immediately make money. In 2017 and 2018, the city was losing more than $3 million a year on the facility. Sports economists say this isn’t all that unusual, adding that despite the money poured into them, sports stadiums and related local sports initiatives rarely generate much impact on their own.
When it comes to sports teams and stadiums, “the economic footprint of these things is very, very small, and it’s very, very limited in terms of the calendar,” said Michael Leeds, a sports economist and professor of economics at Temple University. “Imagine yourself building a mall, building a shopping center that is going to be operational one month out of the year.”
“Those economic ripples die down very, very quickly,” he added.
An oft-cited 2007 paper from researchers at Lake Forest College and College of the Holy Cross reached a similar conclusion. In a study looking at the economic impact generated from college home football and men’s basketball games played by the University of Florida and Florida State University on the cities of Gainesville and Tallahassee respectively, researchers found fairly small economic impacts from football and no impact from college basketball. 
“The economic footprint of these things is very, very small, and it’s very, very limited in terms of the calendar.”Michael Leeds, Temple University
“The loud roars inside the stadium are only quiet blips in the economic data,” the researchers argued. 
A more recent comprehensive survey published in 2022 by a trio of researchers from Kennesaw State University, the University of Maryland Baltimore County and West Virginia University noted that research looking at the economic impacts of sports teams has produced “near-universal consensus evidence that sports venues do not generate large positive effects on local economies.” 
This is largely due to the fact that while sporting events generate a burst of spending, when it comes from locals it’s often money that was already going to be spent in the same area on a different non-sporting activity. And when nonlocals come into town for an event, the money they spend — even if significant — is a temporary, often one-time increase.
That isn’t to say there’s no benefit to a sports team at all. The aforementioned research survey acknowledged that the presence of a local sports team in a city “may also generate intangible nonpecuniary amenity benefits that raise the welfare of local residents, even if they are not directly enriched by it.”  
In other words, a sports team may help spur other important factors, like local pride and community engagement, that have a positive effect in an area.  
Even as they tout possible economic benefits, that latter focus is what Connecticut officials have truly emphasized as they continue the fight to keep the Sun. Supporters say the impact of the team is about more than money. 
That’s doubly true in Hartford, which is looking to transform its downtown economy following the pandemic recession. 
“Downtown has to be more of a neighborhood than it has been,” Freimuth said. “It has to have a niche in the region, and its niche is going to be entertainment.” Moving the Sun could be one way to help the city down an entertainment-oriented path as it embarks on that goal. 
But supporters say there’s an even more foundational reason to keep the Sun: The team has woven itself into Connecticut’s state image, becoming a longstanding part of the sports ecosystem at a time when Connecticut and the WNBA needed each other. 
“It hurts our pride a little bit if we lose that,” Nord said of the team. “That’s one less brand that we could point to as a state…this great thing that we can all point to and have a lot of pride in that it’s part of our community.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP22210060142984-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 05:57:12.155442

Mike DeWine.
Last Thursday, the members went through the list of proposals they’ve considered to make sure they’re on the same page.
In all, Co-Chairman Bill Seitz walked the members through more than 20 different ideas, gently badgering them to settle any remaining quibbles and turn in proposed language for any last-minute ideas.
As they have been throughout, working group members are largely on the same page.
Existing Ohio House bills limiting property tax increases across the board to the rate of inflation and freezing taxes for low-income seniors both got a thumbs up.
Previously vetoed
Budget provisions previously vetoed by DeWine came back with significant tweaks.
State lawmakers wanted to punish school districts for carrying a cash balance greater than 40% of their operating budget year to year.

The working group would put the carry over limit at 100% and apply it to all taxing authorities.
“What’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,” Seitz said. “Some of the worst examples in some people’s minds of large, large carryovers are not from schools. They’re from other special levies and saving for a rainy day that would rival Noah and the ark.”
Similarly, the working group put guardrails on a proposal empowering County Budget Commissions, made up of the local auditor, treasurer, and prosecutor, to roll back levies the commission deems excessive.
DeWine bristled at the idea of county officials negating a measure the voters just approved.
The working group determined there should be a five-year safe harbor for new levies and two years for renewals.
State lawmakers also wanted to restrict the kinds of levies school districts can propose — including the removal of fixed-sum emergency and substitute emergency levies.
The working group wants to allow emergency levies, but only if the auditor has placed the district in fiscal caution, watch, or emergency.
Their proposal would also limit emergency levies to five years without any renewal.
During the discussion, Pickaway County Commissioner Gary Scherer asked: with all those changes, what’s the difference between an emergency levy and ordinary operating levy?
“You can use the word emergency.” Seitz said. “I mean, if it’s truly an emergency, the voters need to know it’s an emergency.”
Still wrestling
The working group is still working through out a handful of ideas, though.
A proposal for presenting levies as a percentage on the ballot is still waiting on draft language.
But the working group spent much more of its time debating interest.
When voters approve a levy, the collection and administration of that money is typically handled by the county. While it’s in the county’s hands, that money earns interest — which the county keeps.
Co-Chair Pat Tiberi doesn’t like that arrangement.
He sits on Delaware County’s Board of Health, and explained they delayed going to voters with a new levy for as long as possible.
When they eventually did, he said they were “100% shocked” to learn that they don’t get the interest on that tax revenue.
“Someone pointed out to us that Pickaway County’s Health Board gets to keep their interest,” he said, “and In Delaware County, the interest the previous year was $350,000. Derived from our levy — just one year. It was in the millions of dollars over the term of the levy.”
If that interest got plowed back into the Health Board he argued, they could’ve put off going to the voters.
Allen County Treasurer Krista Bohn and Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan tried to warn him off.
Nolan praised Tiberi’s intention but worried about how it would work in practice.
“It’s not wrong, I don’t disagree with that at all,” he said. “I’m just worried about the amount of work that it takes.”
Bohn explained that interest revenue is paying for offices like hers to manage their books — not to mention cover the agency’s rent.
If you start splitting the funds up, she added, there’s less opportunity for meaningful returns.
“To keep it completely separate, as you’re asking,” she said, “the cost and the administrative, the staffing, everything to Matt (Nolan)’s point, would increase significantly, and the interest would decrease,” she said.
They were quick to add that when interest rates are low, county officials are effectively subsidizing their agencies
Tiberi pushed back, noting that if some places like Pickaway County already do it, why can’t they be a model?
Scherer, who serves as a Pickaway County Commissioner, chimed in that his county’s arrangement isn’t so much that the agencies get to keep the interest on their levies, as it is that the agencies and the county make a deal to share it.
Scherer promised to share the formula.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)Amid federal efforts to scale-back clean energy incentives, utility regulators in Maine approved five new renewable energy projects.
On Sept. 16, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved a four-megawatt hydroelectric facility and four solar projects totaling more than 250 megawatts through a procurement process that prioritized the reuse of contaminated land for economic development. 
In July, the commission asked for proposals to develop energy projects that used eligible renewable resources, which could include solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass. Priority was given to projects that would be placed on agricultural land contaminated with per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals.
Although that approach is intended to help communities turn environmental challenges into economic opportunities, Commission Chair Philip Bartlett said it was difficult to assess the benefits of these projects because of the current market and federal policy changes. 
The Inflation Reduction Act offered developers a 30% tax credit into the 2030s for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. However, President Donald Trump signed a policy measure on July 4 that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
States fast-track wind, solar permits and contracts to beat Trump’s deadline

Some states, including Maine, have tried to fast-track clean energy projects in light of that change, but these particular projects were the result of legislation Gov. Janet Mills signed into law in June 2025 that called for expedited procurements for cost-effective renewable energy projects. 
“Assessing benefits based on assumptions and forecasts is particularly challenging at this moment,” Bartlett said. “We’ve seen significant changes in federal policy that will make renewable projects more expensive going forward, and there is increasing uncertainty and potential volatility in our [renewable energy credit], energy, and capacity markets.”
Bartlett added that all three commissioners agreed the new projects have “a reasonably strong chance of achieving benefits and will also provide a hedge against market volatility in the years ahead.”
The leader of the Governor’s Energy Office, which is expected to transition to the cabinet-level Maine Department of Energy Resources this fall, expressed support for the projects selected. . 
“This procurement, expedited by bipartisan legislation, will result in new clean energy generation for Maine that should be able to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits and deliver affordable energy to ratepayers,” Director Dan Burgess said.
In the future, the new Department of Energy Resources will conduct competition procurements for clean energy projects that are approved by the Public Utilities Commission. Mills also signed LD 1868 into law earlier this year to codify the state’s goal of using 100% clean energy by 2040. 
More details about the projects, including the name of the bidder, will be announced in the coming weeks after contracts are finalized, the commission said.

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)From 2001 to 2011, I worked as a Child Protective Services social worker in Kansas, growing disillusioned with the effect of foster care on families.
In 2013, I was investigated by CPS and the police for child abuse, and their incompetence wrecked my life for six years. I currently work as a therapist in a psychiatric residential treatment facility in Kansas, and many of my clients have been — or currently are — in foster care. My experience on both sides gives me a perspective that few others share, enabling me to be both fair and compassionate in how I view the system.
In our quest to reduce foster care placement, we often overlook a central driver of CPS decision-making: fear.
A wild pendulum swing has long existed in child welfare. Children like Adrian Jones are killed by their parents, and we are justifiably outraged. Lawsuits are filed, CPS is excoriated in the news, and we rage-tweet from our armchairs about who should be fired.
CPS responds by swinging the other way and removing children from their families so they don’t repeat their sin of not removing kids like Adrian. Children are then removed unnecessarily by an overzealous system, and families are needlessly destroyed. Lawsuits are filed, and then we swing back the other way and leave children with abusive families to avoid being punitive.
In the middle of this chaos are the caseworkers. Nobody wants to be the person who makes the wrong decision that results in a child’s death or continued maltreatment. I made mistakes as a CPS worker, and many mistakes were made by the professionals investigating me. When we talk about fixing these mistakes, we talk a lot about oversight. The Legislature considers a bill limiting which children can enter foster care. Oversight committee meetings occur so people can testify about being wronged by the system. Advocate and author Richard Wexler suggests we provide families with high-quality defense teams.
These solutions are important, but they occur after the fact. We don’t often talk about improving the work product of the caseworkers from the outset. When I knocked on doors to investigate families, I didn’t take the task forces, the oversight committees, or the lawyers with me. I went by myself, and it was my initial assessment of the family that shaped everything that came after. The sad reality of the child welfare system is that once the narrative is created by the state, it’s incredibly hard to get officials to reverse course even if families have quality attorneys.
Anybody who has ever tried to fight the system knows this to be true. I am one of those people.
There are core issues in child welfare that cause a lot of problems, and they aren’t racism or poverty. They are confirmation bias, echo chambers and toxic groupthink, a complete lack of critical thinking skills, arrogance and ego, and a refusal to take accountability and make amends.
If caseworkers are trained to overcome these things, then their decision-making will be less fear-based. They’ll keep more families together regardless of race or socioeconomic status because they will think through problems effectively using facts and not feelings, have a greater understanding of human behavior, and find creative solutions not centered in a hyper-reactive, emotional response. This was my experience as a social worker for the state of Kansas for 10 years.
CPS is an entry-level position most often held by recent college graduates and is viewed as a pit stop on your way to something better. We have paired our most vulnerable families with inexperienced caseworkers who don’t quite know what they’re doing yet. We expect caseworkers to make high-stakes decisions within the constraints of difficult societal issues with no room for error. And when they inevitably make mistakes, we just can’t seem to understand where it all went wrong.
Do you want to improve child welfare outcomes? Let’s focus on supporting caseworkers with quality training and worker development. Families benefit the most when caseworkers succeed, and that’s a win for all of us.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)It takes an astonishing lack of awareness about the volatile present tense, amid rising political violence in a country awash in firearms, to propose legislation that would let politicians carry concealed guns into the Ohio Statehouse.
But the Republican co-sponsors of Ohio House Bill 460, state Reps. Thad Claggett of Newark and Bernard Willis of Springfield, seem oblivious to the potential lethal ramifications of mixing explosive politics with easy access to handguns.
Ohio House Bill 460, introduced only a week after the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, is the latest measure spearheaded by GOP lawmakers in the General Assembly to relax state gun restrictions in public buildings in a nod to gun rights absolutists. 
But promotion of this particular bill, in the red-hot fallout of the Kirk shooting, which included vehement calls on the right for avenging his death with all-out war on the left, was strikingly tone-deaf in a frightening juncture of political unrest made worse by reckless posturing.
In contrast, responsible, bipartisan leadership in the legislature recognized that a tinderbox of violent escalation required immediate deescalation of knee-jerk politics that spark hostile reaction and provoke alarm — like a proposal to arm warring partisans in the state capital with hidden weapons.
 Instead, top legislative officials expressed their common values in the wake of a tragedy.
A joint statement from Republican Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, Republican Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, Democratic Minority House Leader Dani Isaacsohn, and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio stressed that a free democracy “depends on the open and peaceful exchange of ideas.”

But they warned “political violence destroys the bedrock upon which that freedom of expression is built” because when there is fear that political viewpoints “might lead to political violence, we are no longer able to speak our minds or advocate for our priorities.” 
Consider that fear quotient going through the roof during an especially contentious policy fight between polar opposite factions verbally duking it out in a legislative chamber where agitated ideologues have concealed Glocks at the ready as emotions fray.     
Bizarrely, Claggett, the Licking County Republican behind the concealed carry bill for members of the legislature, (as well as statewide elected officials and judges) appeared to suggest more handguns were somehow an antidote to the fraught nature of polarized politics, a necessary protection for elected officials “in places where people can get heated.”
But what happens if some of those heated people with guns lose control in the passion of the moment? What happens when a feud between armed political rivals gets personal in the Statehouse? 
Two other Ohio House Republicans, state Reps. Justin Pizzulli and Adams Mathews, also co-sponsored legislation to loosen Ohio’s concealed carry laws earlier this year. 
They want to allow firearms in some government buildings that have a courtroom.
Ohio bill allowing guns in some government buildings may have significant loophole

Ohio House Bill 68, a reintroduction of a measure from the previous General Assembly, would mostly affect smaller municipalities in Ohio that have multi-use public buildings that may, for example, house city council chambers and city offices as well as a magistrate court. 
Under the proposed bill, a gun owner could bring a concealed weapon into a municipal center with a courtroom except when court is in session. 
You could conceivably go to your local city hall or municipal office to pay a utility bill or get a zoning permit and not know whether the individual next to you has a loaded Smith and Wesson in a shielded holster. 
But what if a judicial proceeding is scheduled in that public building after someone brings a concealed handgun into the facility perhaps posing a threat before court even gavels into business? 
It wouldn’t be the first time an aggrieved litigant plotted an armed confrontation to settle a dispute or silence an accuser.
What if a disgruntled public employee with perceived workplace grievances and a concealed weapon comes to the job prepared to reconcile conflict with violence? 
It has certainly happened in the past with current or former government employees, including the high-profile mass shooting tragedy at the municipal building in Virginia Beach, Va. in 2019.  
Pizzulli insists his “common-sense” legislation “empowers local control and strengthens our concealed carry framework.” 
But what does House Bill 68 do to protect residents at a city council meeting where the presence of intimidating firearms might create a tense atmosphere and potentially push a shouting match into threats of gun violence? 
How does allowing concealed weapons in public buildings — in a state with a permitless concealed carry law that removed important safety measures like comprehensive background checks, fingerprinting, and firearm training requirements — minimize the threat of everyday clashes escalating into deadly situations with potentially dangerous or untrained individuals able to conceal carry in fiery public hearings or heavily trafficked public spaces?
Ultimately, why change gun-free zones in government buildings, with or without courtrooms, if the safety benefits to the people who visit or work in those buildings outweigh the risks of carrying hidden weapons in public venues? 
Nobody, outside of gun rights absolutists and the oblivious politicians they own, is clamoring for more loaded firearms at their local city hall. 
Seriously. Why would anyone deliberately tempt fate in a country reeling from horrific political killings and the pervasive, numbing, uniquely American scourge of daily gun slaughter?

Keedrick Palmer, Director of Youth United, a United Way of the Capital Area program, has a mission that can be summed up in one powerful line: “Preparing next generation’s leaders today.” Motivated by his own experience growing up without strong guidance, Keedrick has been committed to positively shaping young lives since junior high. Now completing his first year leading the Mississippi program, his personal motto, “aspire to inspire,” fuels a passion for empowering students across his home state. Youth United currently operates in schools located in Hinds, Madison, and Rankin County, a two-year commitment for high school juniors who serve as ambassadors through their senior year.

At the center of Youth United and Keedrick Palmer’s approach are three pillars: community service and visible engagement in local neighborhoods; etiquette and professional presence, including in-person behavior and responsible social media use; and college and career preparation, which covers admissions navigation, scholarship searches, ACT guidance, and interview readiness. Recruitment is promoted through the website, social media, and radio. Students apply on their own, complete a formal application, and attend an in-person interview in professional dress, where they are evaluated on punctuality, preparedness, and communication. High school campus advisors serve as logistical partners for passes and school coordination, but the program emphasizes that selection is rooted in student self-advocacy.
Students say the program is already shaping their outlook. Seneca Kelly, a junior at Terry High School, said, “The program influences my passion for advocacy by giving me more opportunities to meet new people and experience stories from others’ points of view. I plan on using these skills by explaining to others that there is more than one way to look at things and sometimes you have to flip the page to see what you are looking for.”

Monthly training takes place through the “Ambassador Bootcamp,” where community leaders, college representatives, legislative trainers, health professionals, and corporate partners offer presentations. Training sessions focus on building public speaking, networking, event planning, advocacy, and collaboration skills. Ambassadors are expected to bring what they learn back to their schools and communities, leading projects that align with United Way’s pillars of Health & Wellness, Education, and Economic Mobility. Students plan and execute engagement, schedule meetings, cultivate partnerships, and run events with minimal adult oversight.
For Ridgeland High School senior Kashvi Sukhadia, the program has changed how she views her community. “Before being a part of it, I often overlooked the challenges of my community, but as I worked on projects, I started to understand how deeply they affect people’s daily lives and why even small problems matter. One project that stood out to me was the Love Yours Health Symposium, a health awareness program that promoted different fields of health. By working on this project, I understood the importance of teamwork while seeing how I could make an impact on people my age by being active and contributing. I not only volunteered but also collaborated with students, guest speakers, and organizations all working side by side. This experience showed me that making an impact on others can be both meaningful to me and helpful to others.”

Community engagement efforts have included United Way Day at the Capitol, where students meet state legislators to raise issues they see locally; mental health symposiums; college and career fairs; school cleanups and “adopt a hallway” initiatives; mentoring and reading at elementary schools; and visits to nursing homes with snacks, crafts, and companionship. Students research local problems, identify resources, and design events as practical solutions.
Clinton High School junior Kerri West said the Ambassadors Program has helped her build essential leadership skills and collaborate with a network of like-minded peers and mentors. “A moment that made me feel proud was coming up with ideas and working with my peers on ways we could help different areas in our community,” she said.

The program measures success in terms of students reached, service events completed, and attendance figures. Other measures include pre- and post-program self-assessments, surveys, and visible growth in confidence and leadership behavior. Participation, punctuality, follow-through on projects, and, when possible, college acceptances and scholarships are also tracked. 
Keedrick acknowledges there are challenges. However, he remains optimistic about the program’s future. Plans include prioritizing fundraising to strengthen school-based events around college, careers, and mental health, and eventually creating an ambassador leadership retreat in Washington, D.C.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/17121512/IMG_2928.jpg,,,2025-09-23 02:56:31.593095

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)After a recent series of audits critical of his executive agencies, Gov. Wes Moore (D) promised during remarks Monday in Randallstown to address the issues, though he asserted that problems at the relevant agencies began before his tenure.
“We believe in accountability, we believe in getting to the bottom of it and we believe in making sure that we have systems that are actually serving the people of our state,” Moore said.
The most recent such audit found that the Maryland Department of Human Services failed to adequately vet homes for foster children, and cited seven homes with registered sex offenders that were also housing foster children as of August 2024. In addition, an individual working for a group foster home had been convicted of a sexual assault of a minor, and another vendor had an employee who had been convictef of murder in 1990, although it could not be dcetermined if that employee had access to children.
The social services audit covered a period from 2020 to 2024, so it included the end of Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) administration as well as the beginning of Moore’s athough the audit did cite problems that preceded Moore.
Other recent audits have faulted Moore’s administration for “knowingly” overspending on transportation projects with federal grants, potentially forcing the state to pick up the tab, and for costly leases for state office buildings.
“While these problems might have happened before our administration came on board, we are committed to making sure that we are there to address them,” Moore said Monday.

Ellis, a Baltimore resident who announced his bid for governor in January, made it official Monday when he filed his paperwork with the Maryland State Board of Elections in Annapolis. In a statement announcing the filing, Ellis said Owen Silverman Andrews would seek the lieutenant governor’s post as a Green.
Ellis ran for one of three seats in the House of Delegates from District 45 in Baltimore in 2018. He picked up 3,735 votes and finished fifth behind Glenn L. Ross, another Green Party candidate, in a field of eight candidates.
As a third party, the Green party will select its candidate in a meeting next year rather than at the ballot box during the primary election for Democrats and Republicans.
Ellis joins a growing field of announced, filed, and unfiled candidates including Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, Republican John Myrick, and recently minted Republican Ed Hale.

The Maryland Democratic Party is calling on Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan to denounce some social media posts produced by a shadowy group that has spent the last year targeting Gov. Wes Moore.
The demand by state party officials follows an online report in which the executive director of Maryland Democratic Party and a lawmaker criticized some posts produced by NoMoore.org as racist.
“Larry Hogan must make it clear to the people of Maryland whether or not he or his allies are behind this dark money campaign that’s spreading lies about Governor Moore,” said Joe Francaviglia, deputy executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party. “Hogan wants people to believe that he rises above the partisan squabble, well it’s time to prove it.”
The Monday statement is the party’s latest challenge to the anti-Moore group. In February, the party filed a complaint with the Maryland State Board of Elections. The organization registered in August with the Federal Election Commission as a political action committee. It has not declared support for any candidate, but many Democrats believe it is a front for Hogan and a possible 2026 run for governor.

The organization — the members of which remain unknown — uses AI-generated content to lampoon Moore. Earlier this month, it produced such a post showing Moore with actor George Clooney, after the release of photos showing Moore and his wife vacationing in Italy reportedly at Clooney’s villa.
Other posts feature Moore in a rainbow clown wig and nose — a theme repeated in a post about Carter Elliott, a Moore spokesperson who has moved to the campaign — or as the Cowardly Lion from “The Wizard of Oz.”
Last week, Maryland Democratic Party Executive Director Karen Darkes and Del. Jeffrie E. Long Jr. (D-Calvert and Prince George’s) denounced the memes in an article published by The Grio, calling the posts racist and “reminiscent of how Black Americans were depicted in minstrel shows.”
A Hogan spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. But in an unsigned statement, a spokesperson for NoMoore.org defended the efforts.
“Maryland Democrats can’t defend Moore’s record on spending and taxes, so they’re screaming ‘racism’ and inventing conspiracies instead. They’ll do anything to distract from his failed leadership,” the organization wrote. “The truth is simple: NoMoore.org is a grassroots movement of Marylanders fed up with a governor who torched a $5.5B surplus, left families paying more for everything, and spends more time chasing the presidency than managing our state.”
The group rejected criticism that the social media posts are racist.
“It’s outrageous that the Maryland Democratic Party has resorted to playing the race card,” the statement said. “This isn’t about race. It’s about results. We deserve fiscal responsibility and leadership that tells the truth. That’s what we’ll continue to focus on.”

Our communities are shouldering the burden of poor air quality, high asthma rates, and sky-rocketing, unmanageable bill increases.
As representatives of health, faith, labor, business and environmental groups in Connecticut, we advocate for cleaner, more affordable energy that addresses the gas-reliant root of these problems and moves us toward a sustainable future for our state. Offshore wind is a solution, ready to save local families money, reduce pollution from our energy sources, and create good paying jobs.
Now, we stand united against the efforts of the federal administration to disrupt Connecticut’s first offshore wind project. Despite having secured all required federal and state permits, Revolution Wind was ordered to stop work with no notice or clear rationale. The project is already 80 percent complete. Forty-five constructed wind turbines – capable of harnessing clean, local, affordable energy – now stand idle off our coast.
On the job front, Revolution Wind has already created more than 1,000 good paying local jobs, with hundreds more workers slated to begin work later this year. Construction of offshore wind farms has given new life to the State Pier in New London, and engaged more than 50 Connecticut companies in the project supply chain. Trump’s stop-work order is a senseless and heartless attack on Connecticut workers and businesses.
The strong and constantly blowing wind off our coast is a treasure trove of homegrown energy. Once construction is completed, Revolution Wind will power over 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Prior to the stop work order, the project was anticipated to go online in late 2026. Our power grid operator, ISO-New England, is already expecting offshore wind to supply the power our region needs and has warned of disruptions to grid reliability in the absence of offshore wind power. Derailing the development of Revolution Wind is unnecessary and dangerous.
While natural gas prices are on the rise and expected to increase further, resulting in higher energy bills, offshore wind is a route to affordability. According to a 2024 Sierra Club Report, plugging in 9 GWs of offshore wind by 2030 would save New England an average of $630 million annually on electricity costs, with net savings in some years surpassing $1.3 billion. A July 2025 report by Daymark Energy Advisors determined that if the 3.5 GW of offshore wind currently under development in New England had been operational last winter it would have saved ratepayers $400 million on their bills by offsetting high natural gas prices.
The air we breathe and our climate are also in dire need of the environmental benefits that offshore wind brings. The gas industry has made Connecticut a hub of dirty power, and our communities are left to bear the health and climate harming pollution that comes with it. Just last week, Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) reported that emissions from power plants increased in 2023. With 9 GWs of offshore wind, the New England states could cut 42 percent of annual CO2 emissions from the New England power sector and provide $362 million in annual public health benefits by avoiding 3,700 short tons of NOX emissions, 824 tons of SO2 emissions, and 641 tons of PM2.5 emissions annually.
For all these reasons, we stand behind Attorney General William Tong and Gov. Ned Lamont in fighting this stop work order, and we stand together in defense of offshore wind and the right of Connecticut residents to a sustainable, breathable, and affordable energy future.

Owned by the Housatonic Railroad Company, this track is called the Maybrook Line, and it is to most residents of the community a mere curio of a bygone age. Yet this forgotten track is not just some useless anachronism, but an opportunity. By reviving it for passenger service and pairing it with smart zoning reforms, we can tackle Connecticut’s housing crisis, ease traffic congestion, and lay the tracks for a more sustainable future.
To understand the potential of the Maybrook Line, we must examine broader challenges facing the Nutmeg State. Connecticut faces a cost-of-living crisis driven by a housing shortage. With demand far outpacing supply, home prices have soared, putting the American Dream out of reach for many residents. Restrictive zoning laws lie at the heart of this crisis, as they artificially limit the supply of housing. The Maybrook Line passes through towns where zoning codes largely restrict housing to single-family homes on large lots. In addition, these local regulations strictly delineate commercial and residential zones. This kind of rigid, top-down government control of land use artificially chokes housing construction and entrenches automobile dependency.
As a result of these zoning rules, daily life in these communities is dictated by the car. This government-enforced automobile dependence leads to clogged roads, poisonous carbon emissions, and overburdened taxpayers, stuck with the bill for endless maintenance projects. Nowhere are the negative results of these planning choices more apparent than I-84 at rush hour.
What if there was another way? What if you could walk from your home to a station, and sip coffee as you glide past the honking steel glacier of I-84? Instead of mind-numbing bumper-to-bumper traffic, you could arrive at work refreshed and return home in a better mood for your family. When we already live with high taxes, pollution, and inconvenience, why not explore alternatives?
This is where the Maybrook Line comes in. While it currently lacks the capacity for passenger service, it forms a link between Metro-North’s Danbury and Waterbury branches. By retrofitting the Maybrook Line for passenger service and constructing new stations along its route, Connecticut could connect three underutilized railroad branches into a wider rail network, improving transportation options for thousands of commuters and daytrippers. However, for the service to be financially self-sustaining, reforms to stimulate transit-oriented development along its route would be essential.
Transit-oriented development refers to community planning that centers access to public transportation. For a revitalized Maybrook Line to financially support its own operation, areas around newly constructed stations could be rezoned for greater density to provide a sufficient ridership base. In this way, Connecticut can tackle its housing shortage while providing alternatives to car-centered development. 
Let’s say a town along the Maybrook route adopts a zoning ordinance for an area within 800 meters of a planned station. Within this zone, new regulations could allow for mixed-use construction, a sensible easing of height and setback restrictions, and reductions in minimum lot and unit sizes. To preserve community character, prohibitions should remain on structures like drive-thrus, industrial sites, and self-storage facilities. These kinds of common-sense zoning adjustments can create vibrant, pedestrian-friendly hubs where the Maybrook Line becomes a natural part of daily life, elevating the community rather than obliterating it.
Local residents may recoil to hear of this proposal. Many are jealously protective of the character of their hometown and see zoning as a means through which they can keep property values high and the riff-raff out. But rezoning around constructed stations wouldn’t just make the Maybrook Line viable for commuters; it would directly benefit existing town residents. Greater density means a lower tax burden for residents, because mixed-use and moderate-density development expands the tax base, spreading costs across more people and businesses.
The CT Department of Transportation should conduct a feasibility study on reactivating passenger service along the Maybrook Line. If the study confirms its viability, the state can begin upgrading the physical infrastructure while collaborating with local communities to address concerns about the project’s impact. Concurrently, zoning councils can enact targeted zoning reforms adjacent to planned stations to support ridership, ensuring that the investment in this rail line delivers substantial returns.
I realize that some may dismiss this as too ambitious, too complicated, too old-fashioned, even. After all, am I really suggesting that Connecticut revive a transportation system that peaked in the late 19th century? Yes, I am. To unlock its future, Connecticut can look to its past. 
By revitalizing forgotten infrastructure and embracing common-sense transit and zoning policies, we can build a state that is more affordable, connected, and sustainable.

First, let’s talk about the Keystone XL Pipeline. President Biden shut it down on his very first day in office. That project would have provided thousands of good-paying jobs, strengthened U.S. energy independence, and delivered a reliable supply of affordable energy to Americans. Instead, Biden caved to environmental extremists and cut off a lifeline that would have stabilized energy markets. So before anyone accuses President Trump of destroying jobs, let’s remember who actually canceled them.

Second, New England’s energy future cannot be built on slogans alone. Wind and solar have their place, but they are intermittent sources — the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. Pretending otherwise is reckless. That’s why President Trump is right to insist on a balanced, reliable energy mix that includes natural gas, nuclear power, and advanced renewables. Nuclear, in particular, offers clean, carbon-free, always-on electricity. If we’re serious about reducing emissions without sacrificing reliability, nuclear must be part of the conversation.
Third, the idea that offshore wind projects like Revolution Wind are some sort of cure-all ignores their very real detriments:
Skyrocketing costs – Offshore wind is among the most expensive forms of electricity. Ratepayers end up footing the bill through subsidies and higher electric rates.
Taxpayer handouts – Billions of federal and state tax dollars are funneled into wind power projects that cannot stand on their own. Families struggling to pay grocery bills shouldn’t be forced to bankroll failed experiments.
Unreliability – When the wind doesn’t blow, the grid still needs backup from fossil fuels or imports. That means double-paying for both wind and dependable baseload power.
Environmental harm – Large turbines disrupt marine ecosystems and pose risks to fisheries, particularly during construction.
Industrialization of coastlines – Massive turbine farms change the character of coastal communities, spoil viewsheds, and impact tourism.
Short lifespan and decommissioning costs – Offshore turbines last 20–25 years at best, leaving behind expensive removal projects that taxpayers will eventually shoulder.
Battery hazards – To “store” unreliable wind power, enormous lithium battery banks are needed. These are prone to fires that burn so hot they cannot be extinguished with water — endangering first responders and nearby communities.
These aren’t minor issues — they’re why many investors and European countries that went all-in on offshore wind are now facing financial losses and energy instability.
Finally, halting a half-baked offshore wind project is not “destroying jobs.” It’s about protecting taxpayers and ratepayers from being forced into subsidizing projects that are rushed, unreliable, dangerous, and not viable long-term.
President Trump’s energy policy is simple: all-of-the-above, America-first, affordable, and reliable. That means unleashing oil and gas production, finally investing in nuclear, and responsibly developing renewables where they make sense — without killing pipelines, without handcuffing industry, and without driving up costs for working families.
New Englanders deserve real solutions, not green pipe dreams. President Trump understands that. Joe Biden and Ned Lamont do not.

Sept. 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Members of a new commission set to review and offer long-term solutions to how Nebraska funds its 245 public school districts hope to create more stability and predictability.
But the path there, and a major hurdle evident during the commission’s second meeting Monday and likely to persist, is how fast and deeply the commission should dive into policy writing, if at all.
“To reach clear towards … the policy conversation that would be all-inclusive of state voices, I think there’d be a number of voices missing at the table,” said Liz Standish, an associate superintendent with Lincoln Public Schools.

Standish described the group as “really a TEEOSA study group,” referring to the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunity Support Act that passed in 1990 and spells out how Nebraska distributes state funding for public K-12 schools. A major component of the formula is “equalization aid,” which, in broad strokes, is the sum of 18 “needs” minus six “resources.”
Today, all school districts receive $1,500 for each K-12 student and $900 for 4- or 5-year-old pre-K students in “foundation aid,” a change enacted in 2023 along with a major bump in state funding for special education.
‘Any little bit can help’
Current and former lawmakers told Standish and other school leaders that they recognize the commission will need to carefully “thread the needle” on how to offer guidance to the Legislature without being able to pass policy on its own.
“Any little bit can help,” said State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee and the lawmaker who led the bill to create the commission this spring.
Work begins to review how Nebraska funds its 245 K-12 school districts, with possible tweaks

Former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area agreed with Hughes that the Legislature is “starved” for information, partly due to term limits and time constraints on how much lawmakers can delve into specific issues. Linehan served on the Education Committee and chaired the Revenue Committee for six of her eight years in office before being term-limited this January.
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln said the Legislature is welcome to take or leave any of the group’s recommendations. He said he doesn’t think anyone is “under the illusion that this commission is able to create statutes on its own.”
On including more voices at the table, Bostar said that’s the purpose of the legislative process.
“I think I lean more toward the side of venturing into the space of what this commission would imagine its preferred policy solutions to be, understanding that this commission cannot create those policies,” Bostar said Monday.
A preliminary path forward
While the commission took no specific votes on goals or next steps, Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher, the commission chair, offered a preliminary guide for a way forward.
Maher’s draft document on goals for the group divide the commission’s work into three categories — short-term, to be done by the time the first report is due to the Legislature by Dec. 1; mid-term, to be done in 2026 before the second report on Nov. 1, 2026; and long-term, for annual reports due each November after.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward. Sept. 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Under Hughes’ law, the new commission has no expiration date.
Maher’s short-term plan, which he built off of the commissioners’ stated goals from the group’s August meeting, would dedicate the next couple of months to “Nebraska school funding facts,” such as:

Identifying the percentages of local, state and federal funding for the years 2022-23 compared to now.
Identifying a group of school districts to compare in funding, such as funding distribution percentages and other factors, including property tax rates.
Reviewing other states’ school funding models and formulas.
Establishing a state funding distribution target.

According to data the Nebraska Department of Education shared Monday, public schools accounted for about $5.3 billion in estimated spending in the 2024-25 fiscal year. 
Changes in the timing of when state-funded tax credits arrive that offset local school property taxes — which now directly offset property tax bills rather than requiring Nebraskans to file for optional income tax credits later on — has shifted the percentage of local school spending covered by the state.
The state now carries the majority of school funding, at 52.6%, while local and county spending on schools has fallen to about 38%, a reversal from the previous five years, when local property taxes accounted for the majority of revenue.
Early goals
Setting a target for what the balance should be between state and local funding is one of the commission’s earliest goals, but some commissioners said they hope to go further than Maher’s preliminary proposal.

Hughes, for example, hopes to dive more into property tax rates in a long-term goal of bringing school tax levies down and closer together. Linehan said she wants to know more, such as which districts would be “winners” and “losers.”
The Nebraska Department of Revenue has collected local valuation changes for next year, but the Education Department won’t have school property tax rates collected until next month. 
Sarah Scott, Nebraska’s property tax administrator, said it might be possible to marry the valuations with property tax rates early for commissioners to review.
Former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul, a former State Board of Education member, wants to look into option enrollment — the program that allows a family to apply to enroll their student into a school district they don’t reside in, which may lead to net revenue for a receiving school district. State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil said he hopes to look more into valuations and how much of the valuations are factored into property taxes.
Millard Public Schools Superintendent John Schwartz, vice chair of the commission, said the commission’s fact-finding mission is vital for framing future debates. He thanked Maher for summarizing the commission’s “more granular objectives” with a target to work toward.
“I think those dispositional characteristics are things that we’re really striving for,” Schwartz said.
‘Need some goals’
The Nebraska School Financing Review Commission includes 18 members, the majority are school administrators and current or former state legislators. This was the first meeting with all seats filled. Gov. Jim Pillen recently appointed a teacher: Shawna Koger of Arlington Public Schools.

Of the membership, all but four are Pillen appointees.  Three current lawmakers appointed by the Legislature are nonvoting members. Maher serves because of his role as the education commissioner.
The commission plans to next meet at 8 a.m. on Oct. 31 at the Education Department in Lincoln.
Maher told the Nebraska Examiner that he hopes to have another meeting a week before Thanksgiving in November. Either way, he said the commission will meet its Dec. 1 deadline for a first set of recommendations.
“I think we’re going to need some goals to shoot toward as a commission,” Maher told the commission. “Otherwise, I think we’re going to do a lot of talking and maybe not get anywhere.”



School Financing Review Commission long-term goals
Members of the new Nebraska School Financing Review Commission outlined these long-term ambitions during an initial Aug. 12 meeting, as summarized by Education Commissioner Brian Maher:

Increase the stability, predictability and sustainability of year-to-year school funding.
Prevent the structure of school finance from eroding other intended property tax relief.
Increase confidence and trust in Nebraska school funding and related policymaking, with a collaborative process to manage the existing model predictably and annually with data.
Create a basis for ongoing management of the school aid funding formula to address the changing needs of students and schools and evolving policy objectives.
Increase the balance of sustainable funding from the state to schools to lower property taxes.
Strive to find balance in the funding formula between “simple enough” to understand by many to “complex enough” to meet diverse needs.
Strive to bring school property tax levies closer together.
Use the School Financing Review Commission to regularly provide factual information on the status of school finance.

The Trump administration has proposed closing it in the coming years. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State, local and federal Democrats continued to push back Monday against a Trump administration proposal to shutter the Beltsville Agriculture Research Center and scatter its staff across the country, saying the center should stay at its current Prince George’s County home.
The lawmakers gathered Monday at the Beltsville center to highlight some of the research conducted there and argue that the current location is ideal for such studies.
“We call Maryland ‘America in Miniature.’ This BARC Ag facility is able to test many different types of crops on many different kinds of climate conditions,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told reporters Monday. “They’ve been doing studies, some have gone on for over 10 years, on the land here at BARC. You can’t just uproot that and take it to another part of the country.”
The news conference is the latest attempt by Maryland Democrats to counter a U.S. Department of Agriculture “reorganization” plan that the administration says will “achieve improved effectiveness and accountability, enhanced services, reduced bureaucracy and cost savings for the American people.”
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a memo announcing the changes in July that several USDA agencies in and around Washington, D.C., would be moved to other parts of the country to be “located closer to the people it serves while achieving savings to the American taxpayer.”

Part of that plan calls for closing the 6,500-acre Beltsville center. The plan also calls for moving thousands of the USDA workers based in and around Washington to one of five regional hubs to reduce salary costs. Closing the Beltsville center would occur “over multiple years to avoid disruption of critical USDA research activities,” according to Rollins’ memo.
But Van Hollen and his colleagues — Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), Glenn Ivey (D-4th) and Jamie Raskin (D-8th) — argued Monday that the loss of the Beltsville center could disrupt decades of research and even be more costly in the long run. Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) also attended but had to leave before the news conference.
The press conference was held outside the USDAs National Agricultural Library, across U.S. Route 1 from the Beltsville research center. After a tour of the research center, the lawmakers acknowledged that 115-year-old facility needs repairs, but insisted that moving locations would be more expensive than investing in the center where it is.
Ivey called the USDA’s plan “terrible stewardship of the American tax dollar” and said moving the facility would waste millions on recent upgrades and repairs that have already been made to the Beltsville facility.
“There’s been a multimillion-dollar investment in this space, and if you just pick it up and move it, you’re squandering that money,” Ivey said. “It’s expensive to move, and you’d have to build new facilities wherever you go. And you’re going to lose the human capital.”
Also in attendance were Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D), County Councilmember Thomas E. Dernoga (D), state Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s) and Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel).
Van Hollen highlighted the many agricultural research breakthroughs that have come from the Beltsville facility, from crop disease resistance to a recent development on the causes of bee colony collapse.
“Grass seed that you use in your backyard. The mosquito repellent you put on when you go for a hike. Roma tomatoes. Turkeys that you eat at Thanksgiving,” Van Hollen said. “Those are all brought to you by research here at BARC – and that’s just here on the consumer side. For farmers, it is especially important that BARC continue to do it’s work.”
Alsobrooks said that moving the facility and its workers would be illegal without congressional approval and would likely disrupt long-term research programs.
Maryland officials vow to fight Trump plans to relocate FBI to another site in D.C.

“Decades upon decades of important research literally would not survive the move and would be lost,” she said.
Losing the Beltsville facility would be just the latest blow to Prince George’s County by the federal government.
In January, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing announced that it was canceling plans to move its printing operations from its current plant in Washington to a new facility planned for ag center property in Beltsville, a move that would have brought about 1,400 jobs to the county. And in July, the FBI reversed more than a decade of study and planning and said it would not be building its new headquarters in Greenbelt, but would remain downtown instead in new quarters in the Ronald Reagan Building.
Hoyer argued that keeping BARC in Maryland is “not about politics,” but rather about “rationally organizing our agricultural community so that they can succeed and be the best at what they do in the world.”
“It’s a big campus – it is mostly ground and trees and vegetables and livestock,” he said. “There are buildings here as well, some that need repair – but what doesn’t need repair are the people who work here. It’s not the brick and mortar. It’s the people, the extraordinary talent that has been aggregated here.”

(Naomi Delkamiller/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — A voting advocacy group has sued to block Nebraska’s secretary of state from sharing voter registration data with the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The lawsuit from Common Cause Nebraska seeks an injunction to stop Secretary of State Bob Evnen from providing data to the DOJ. Federal officials have asked states for names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, saying they want the information to ensure accurate voter registration rolls. 
Common Cause asked a Lancaster County District Court to find that the DOJ request violates Nebraska law protecting data privacy. It aims to prohibit the Secretary of State from providing the voter data to the DOJ or to limit the types of data shared. 
Some GOP states have declined or are pushing back against federal efforts to gather the data over privacy concerns. Critics have questioned the safety of letting any administration consolidate such voter data in one place. The federal government has sued two Democratic-run states for the data, the first legal challenge the department has brought against states to obtain the registration records.

The Justice Department sent a letter to Nebraska’s secretary of state Sept. 8 with a Sept. 22 deadline to provide the data. The Secretary of State’s Office told the Examiner it hasn’t provided the data to the DOJ because of the lawsuit. 
“This push for voter data is part of the Trump administration’s broader playbook—using government power to target communities instead of protecting them,” said Omar Noureldin, Common Cause’s senior vice president for policy and litigation.
The Trump administration made a similar request to then-Secretary of State John Gale in 2017. Gale declined to turn over Nebraska’s full voter information because it wouldn’t comply with state law, and he had concerns about data privacy. A public and more limited version of Nebraska’s voter file, including names and addresses, is available for a fee. Registered voters can request to withhold their phone numbers and email addresses.
The DOJ last month said it plans to seek voting and election information from all 50 states. 
The latest DOJ move is another issue for Evnen to balance as he seeks reelection in 2026. He is trying to defend the state’s elections that his office administers and respond to the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, a national framing that some election experts have warned could undermine public trust in elections.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process underway this week is already heating up, with Democrats and some concerned Utahns frustrated that legislators still aren’t following the spirit of a voter-approved law that created an independent redistricting process. 
The Utah Legislature’s newly convened Legislative Redistricting Committee held its first public hearing on Monday to consider a slate of five proposed congressional maps to choose from to submit to 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson by their deadline of Oct. 6. 
Gibson will ultimately decide by Nov. 10 which new map — whether it’s drawn by lawmakers or the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — will replace the 2021 boundaries that she voided in a ruling last month, deeming them a byproduct of an unconstitutional process. 
All of the maps being considered would be relatively more competitive for Democrats when compared to the 2021 map that’s since been tossed out by the courts, but most of them would continue to mix rural and urban communities. Two, however, would take more of a “doughnut hole” approach and carve districts concentrated around the state’s urban core in and around Salt Lake City. 
The Legislative Redistricting Committee did not take action on any map — not expected to publish its preferred choice until Thursday, ahead of a special session expected on Oct. 6 for the full Legislature to take a vote on the map. The committee is scheduled to meet again Wednesday at 11 a.m. to continue weighing next steps.

One of the committee’s co-chairs, Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, emphasized in the first minutes of Monday’s hearing that lawmakers were meeting mid-decade due to court orders — “under protest” because the Legislature’s Republican supermajority disagreed with the judge’s ruling tossing out the 2021 map. 
“We want to make sure that you understand that we are doing this in compliance with the court orders, and under protest,” Sandall said. “But we want to make sure we maintain our constitutional duty to produce a map, so we are going to proceed in that direction.” 
Several Utahns who spoke during the meeting’s public comment period bristled at Sandall’s “under protest” comment.
“Prop 4 is the will of the people. … This is what we want. We want good faith representation and a good faith effort,” said Magdeleine Bradford-Butcher, of Provo. “We are here to do something that is fair for all citizens. Nobody should be protesting that.” 
New changes to Prop 4
In addition to reviewing those proposed maps, lawmakers also weighed a bill that would again impose changes to Better Boundaries’ 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. 
The courts have since determined that Proposition 4, as passed by a slim majority in 2018, is now law. But a draft bill, proposed by Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, would add a new requirement into Proposition 4’s redistricting criteria that would specify that future maps would need to pass a specific statistical “partisan bias test” that ensures “partisan symmetry.” 
Proposition 4’s language already says maps “may not divide districts in a manner that purposefully or unduly favors or disfavors any incumbent elected official, candidate or prospective candidate for elective office or any party.” It also already requires the Legislature and the Independent Redistricting Commission to use “the best available data and scientific and statistical methods, including measures of partisan symmetry” when drawing maps that conform to Proposition 4’s criteria. 
Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, speaks during the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s meeting on Sept. 22, 2025.(Screenshot from Utah Legislature website)
Brammer’s bill would specify, however, that a map that is “symmetrical under the partisan bias test” would not “unduly favor or disfavor.” And it would require any judge’s review of a new congressional map, including Gibson’s, to use the “partisan bias test” as the only tool to determine a map’s fairness. 
The “partisan bias test” defined in Brammer’s bill would use the average margin of past statewide elections (for president, governor, attorney general, treasurer and auditor) to calculate a formula for “partisan symmetry.” A map would pass the test as long as the same statewide vote percentage would translate to the same percentage of seats for either party. The test, would set an acceptable margin based on the average of past statewide elections, which typically have a wide spread between GOP and Democratic voters — with Republicans consistently winning by more than 20 points in statewide races. 
Critics, however, including Democrats on the Legislative Redistricting Committee, argued that requiring the “partisan bias test” as defined in Brammer’s bill would be problematic for a state like Utah that has only four congressional districts and is dominated statewide by the sheer number of registered Republicans compared to Democrats.  
“You’re now trying to codify partisan bias as the only test you use, and that to me is a gigantic red flag,” Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said. “We should have more tests and have them all run in a blind way … so we’re defeating the entire purpose of (Prop 4’s) intent.” 
Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek, argued Brammer’s bill shouldn’t be lawmakers’ first move after the court ordered the Legislature to comply with Proposition 4.
“Are you concerned about the optics of that?” Owens asked Brammer during Monday’s hearing. “The court says follow Prop 4 and the first thing out of the chute is we’re narrowing Prop 4?”

Brammer said he’s not concerned about that, because he’s looking to clarify the law to define a “workable” legal test. While making the case for his bill, Brammer pointed to a sentence in Gibson’s August ruling that specified “the legislature retains discretion in determining” what tools should be used when evaluating maps. He said that was an “invitation” from the courts to lawmakers to define the parameters. 
“The fact that we exercise discretion does not mean that you’re undermining a bill,” Brammer said. “What it means is that you’re actually trying to create a workable methodology for parties to use when proposing maps. And so that’s what we’re working towards.” 
Owens, however, argued that Brammer’s bill sets a rigid definition of “partisan symmetry” that not all experts would agree on. 
“Are you aware that in the academic literature there is more than one definition of partisan symmetry?” Owens challenged. 
Brammer said Proposition 4 “could have very easily defined partisan symmetry” and stated “which tests they were going to use.” He indicated he would be open to debating having more than one method, but he resisted “keeping it wide open and undefined and subject to everyone arguing.” 
“This is simply so that we don’t have a food fight between experts as to the statistical analysis of partisan symmetry,” Brammer said.
What’s next for Utah redistricting – and which lawmakers were picked to draw the new map

Owens continued to push back.
“I think the committee deserves to know that this is a hotly debated issue in the academic literature and in the courts,” Owens said. 
He argued “there is no real world scenario” where the minority party in Utah (Democrats) would win using a map approved under the partisan bias test. 
“This has been specifically criticized as a valid measure of gerrymandering when it’s applied in a lopsided state,” Owens said. “In the real world, the dominant party is going to win every one of those four seats.” 
The Utah Legislature’s redistricting expert
The author of the proposed maps being considered by the Legislative Redistricting Commission is Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics and a nonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 
Trende, whom legislative leaders had also retained as an expert witness in the state’s redistricting litigation, was separately contracted with the Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel to conduct map analysis submitted by legislators, according to legislative researchers who spoke during Monday’s hearing. 
Trende has been retained as an expert witness in dozens of redistricting cases across the country. He was appointed by the Supreme Court of Virginia as one of the co-masters that drew Virginia’s maps after the state’s redistricting commission deadlocked. 
Trende testified during Monday’s hearing on a remote call, from Delaware, Ohio. He walked through all of the proposed maps, explaining that they were drawn using his computer models and the “partisan bias test” while ensuring they factor in Proposition 4’s requirements and evenly distribute populations as constitutionally required. 
Because Salt Lake County’s population would be too big to form a single district, it has to be split at least once. 
Trende said two of the maps being considered were “simulation maps” made to conform to equal population requirements, while two others were “based on” the 2021 congressional map, but “made to bring it into conformance” with Proposition 4’s requirements. 
“So I did draw them, in a way, but not with a free hand,” Trende said. 
When Owens asked whether he always testifies in favor for one party in redistricting cases, Trende pushed back, saying he helped a Democratic caucus in Michigan to come up with a remedial map, and “there are times where I tell Republicans, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t say your map’s not a gerrymander.’”
Judge orders Utah Legislature to draw new congressional maps

When Owens pressed on Brammer’s proposed “partisan bias test” requirement, Trende said he’s never seen a state specifically require partisan symmetry as a standard in an independent redistricting process, “but by doing it, I think one of the consequences is that partisan bias is a test that has to be considered.” 
“The only test that really tests partisan symmetry is partisan bias,” Trende said. “In my view, it’s not an option, since (Prop 4) specifically says to include tests (for) partisan symmetry. I don’t think there’s an option to not include a partisan bias test.” 
When the committee’s co-chair Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, asked Trende whether any of the 2021 maps that were proposed — including those recommended by the independent redistricting commission at the time — would be fair under Proposition 4’s standards today, Trende said they likely wouldn’t. 
“I think they would all have problems,” he said. 
While the 2021 congressional map that lawmakers enacted split Salt Lake County four ways, Trende said all of the independent redistricting commission maps would “fail the partisan bias test.” 
“They show indications of maps being drawn with partisan intent,” he said. “So I don’t think any of those maps are live options under Prop 4.” 
When Owens pressed Trende on whether his computer models’ partisan symmetry tests “allow a district that had a Democrat majority,” Trende said “probably.” 
Owens, however, expressed skepticism. 
“So it’s baked in the cake if we adopt this test that there will never be, and cannot be, and it’s impossible to have, a Democratic majority district,” Owens said. He challenged Trende to produce a map “that shows a Democratic majority and applies his symmetry test, just to see if it’s possible, because I don’t think it is.” 
Utahns urge lawmakers to preserve ‘intent’ of Prop 4
More than a dozen Utahns — both in person and remotely — spoke during Monday’s public hearing, urging lawmakers to adhere to Proposition 4’s intent while also expressing concern that Brammer’s bill, and the proposed maps under consideration, don’t bode well. 
Tiffany Smith, a retired attorney who lives in Millcreek, said she’s a registered Republican who comes from “a long line of family who have served on both sides of the aisle” in both legislative and judicial roles.

“As a lawyer, I want to commend you for trying to convince anyone watching today that the partisan bias test is the only test that is the best test. Wow. You did a great job,” she said. “However, those arguments are not germane to the complete language of Proposition 4. And they distract from the intent in the language of the law.” 
Smith countered that lawmakers are tasked with adhering to Proposition 4, “the neutral criteria and the ban on partisan gerrymandering.” 
“Please respect the will of the voters and not ignore us,” she said. “We are ‘we the people.’ You are accountable to us. Please keep communities together, and if that means that we have an independent or Democratic (representative) … wouldn’t it be refreshing to be the state that actually represents its people fully and set an example of representative democracy?” 
She also emphasized that Proposition 4 encouraged the redistricting process to use statistical methods — plural — and not just one test. 
“Cherry picking a test reverse engineered to say that partisan gerrymandering is fair is improper and undermines the purpose of Proposition 4,” she said.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The organization that manages the electric grid for Pennsylvania and 12 other states has moved too slowly in response to skyrocketing energy demand and consumers are paying for it, Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday.
Speaking at a conference of energy industry leaders and regulators in Philadelphia, Shapiro said PJM Interconnection must make changes, including giving states a bigger role in its governance, or the commonwealth could leave the consortium.
“We need to be thinking about consumers and their costs, something that PJM, I think, doesn’t really spend a whole lot of time focused on,” Shapiro told reporters Monday after delivering opening remarks at the event.
He said governors from each PJM state share concerns about the Valley Forge-based organization’s backlog of new energy projects awaiting approval while peak energy consumption is expected to increase by 20% in the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast. Much of that demand will come from data centers that house the computing power for artificial intelligence.

“We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects. We’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” Shapiro said.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who spoke via video, said overhauling the state’s power policy was among his first calls for action after taking office in 2022. Youngkin, a Republican, said his administration predicted demand would grow faster than PJM’s forecast.
“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said. “This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence.”
Youngkin said Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation that would allow the state to reassess whether its utilities should remain part of PJM.
“This doesn’t mean that we are walking away, but it does mean that collectively, we recognize we need to represent and protect our ratepayers, and that means sending a clear, unified signal that PJM must modernize,” he said.
PJM was founded in Philadelphia nearly a century ago when three electricity utilities connected their independent grids to share resources and improve reliability. With more than 1,000 stakeholder members, it now ensures the flow of power to utilities in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois and the New York border to North Carolina.

It is overseen by a board of governors through a consensus-based issue resolution process in which member organizations and stakeholders have weighted votes on issues that will go before the board. These include state consumer advocate organizations, like Pennsylvania’s Public Utilities Commission, but the states themselves have no direct input.
The board’s decisions are ultimately subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
While PJM’s stakeholder process and meetings are open to the public with agendas and minutes posted on its website, but members of the public are required to register for an account to watch meetings virtually. And while the outcome of votes is public, critics have compared it to a black box because how stakeholders vote on questions is secret. 
Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report thier votes to state regulators. They include a bill introduced by Pennsylvania state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), which passed in the House in July and awaits action in the Senate.
“Utility companies operating in our regional power grid that determine the electric bills, environmental and public health of 65 million people should never be allowed to vote in secret,” Rabb said. “Such decisions must be publicly disclosed. End of story.”

PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is set to step down at the end of this year, said he’s proud of the reliability that PJM has provided through a series of unusual events during his tenure, including record peak demands, a pandemic, geomagnetic storms and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which threatened a major transmission line.
Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted. 
“There’s a lot of mythology and a lot of things that are said about our interconnection queue,” he said, noting that number is down from 200,000 megawatts when the organization implemented reforms in 2023. PJM also notes that it has cleared tens of thousands of megawatts worth of projects that have failed to come online for reasons outside of its control, including site acquisition, permitting and supply chain problems.
PJM has also worked proactively with members to prioritize important projects, such as restarting Constellation Energy’s former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, and redeveloping Homer City, one of the nation’s largest coal power plants, into the nation’s largest natural gas-burning power stations. Both projects will power data centers.  
Experts who spoke during panels at the conference agreed with Shapiro, Youngkin and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who also spoke via video, that PJM is not serving consumers well.
“You’ve got 67 million people who are very concerned, and again, consumers are called voters, and that makes the politicians concerned,” said former FERC Chairman Mark Christie. Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements were recommended by a bipartisan panel of PJM-state governors to fill vacancies on the board, but neither was ultimately nominated.
“PJM should be reimagined in the governance sense,” Christie said, adding that he wouldn’t interfere with the technical aspects of operating the grid. “The policy making things that PJM does in their political policy, if it’s going to be a regional government for the grid, people who are elected will have a much bigger role in that.”
Vincent Duane, a former senior vice president and general counsel at PJM, said changes need to go deeper than simply giving elected officials a bigger role.
“​​I’m going to be blunt and unpopular when I say that PJM has become ungovernable,” Duane said “Adding seats to an already crowded banquet table with 1,000 parliamentarians with vastly different interests, I think, is going to ultimately leave states feeling disappointed with the outcomes.”
What’s missing is more purposeful and deliberate decision making from a strong executive branch in the organization that is accountable to state utility regulators, he said.

Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility. He said he had trouble answering the question. To say the responsibility was to the marketplace or membership was unsatisfactory.
“Until we can get a good answer to that question, it’s premature to start talking about process and voting structures,” Duane said.
Maryland State Delegate Lorig Charkoudian said the question of fiduciary duty is an important one for the success of policies that elected officials create. 
“The vast majority of the stakeholders know who their fiduciary duty is to, and it is to their shareholders,” Charkoudian said, adding that for ratepayers that amounts to a wealth transfer to the market participants who are writing the rules.
“You could go example after example after example, where that is the case,” she said. “And that is why it’s untenable to continue at this moment with this governance structure.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5474-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 21:57:30.331825

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland lawmakers want you to read your utility bill particularly closely this month.
A roughly $40 rebate on electricity bills, approved by the General Assembly in April, is finally heading out to customers, with a second round expected in early 2026.
Legislators took $200 million from a state fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs to send the refund directly to all residential ratepayers, in hopes of easing the burden of recent rate hikes.
State Democrats touted the refund at a news conference Monday in Randallstown, during which Gov. Wes Moore (D) turned the focus to PJM Interconnection, the operator of the 13-state electric grid that includes Maryland. Moore argued that “outdated processes” at PJM have led to the dramatic bill increases, and renewed his calls for the states to gain a voice on the governing board.
“We demand a seat at the table with PJM, because no longer can they make decisions about us when we’re not at the table in the first place,” Moore said.
In remarks at a PJM summit in Philadelphia on Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was even more direct, floating the possibility that his state, the largest energy generator in the grid, could leave PJM if systematic reforms don’t take place in “months, not years.”
“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction, and that will have a significant impact here in this region and across the country,” Shapiro said. “To be clear, that is not a path that I am eager to chart. But I am not willing to stand idly by and let PJM dictate our future.”
Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Republicans fire back
Maryland Democrats, alongside affordability advocates like the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, have thrown barbs at PJM as bills skyrocket, arguing that the grid has not moved quickly enough to allow new energy projects to come online, as projected power demand jumps thanks to artificial intelligence and data centers.
Republicans, a minority in both the Maryland House and Senate, have taken a different tack, arguing that the state’s efforts to promote renewable energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions have increased energy costs.
“The Democratic majority has placed the blame on energy companies and on PJM, as if they have no culpability in the skyrocketing energy costs that have our communities in a chokehold,” House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said in a statement Monday.
The fund that legislators tapped to pay for the electricity bill refund, called the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, is made up largely of proceeds from a carbon dioxide allowance auction and alternative compliance payments from electricity suppliers that do not meet renewable energy requirements. The fund has ballooned in recent years due to an increase in compliance payments.
“Governor Moore isn’t giving out relief — he’s just recycling ratepayer money Maryland families already paid on their utility bills,” said a statement Monday from Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R- Upper Shore).
PJM, meanwhile, argues that some reforms are already underway, including a fast-track process for “shovel-ready” energy projects to get through the queue and connect to the grid. The grid operator also set a cap on a key energy auction that increased prices for PJM customers, at the urging of Shapiro, Moore and other governors in the region.
The refund rollout
Some energy customers in Maryland may have already received the credit on their electric bills. Others might still be waiting. It all depends on the utility and the billing cycle, officials say.
The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel said the state’s three Exelon utilities — Baltimore Gas and Electric, Pepco and Delmarva Power and Light — began issuing refunds in August, but the process extended into September. Potomac Edison expected to issue its refunds in September. The Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, on the other hand, got it done in August.

According to its website, BGE issued the payment by placing its residential customers into one of four tiers based on their average monthly energy usage, with the smallest users receiving a credit of $30.50 and the largest users receiving a credit of $66.
Speaking in her district at the Randallstown Community Center, House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D- Baltimore County) said she has seen the strain of inflation and higher power bills in her community.
“I see people working harder than ever to make ends meet. I see people tightening their budgets. And yes, I see people struggling with rising energy costs,” Jones said.
The refund was one small part of a sprawling energy package passed by the General Assembly and signed by Moore. The main bill, called the Next Generation Energy Act, also aimed to increase in-state power generation, including by creating a fast-track for certain eligible projects at the Maryland Public Service Commission, and to curtail utility infrastructure spending and multiyear rate increase plans.
“We may not be able to make energy costs fall overnight, but together, by combining relief with reform, we can make Maryland a more resilient and a more affordable state for everyone,” Jones said.
The refund comes as Maryland consumers are just beginning to see higher bills resulting from an energy auction held by PJM in 2024, which cleared at a historically high price.
The People’s Counsel estimated that, if the costs were spread out over 12 months, customers could expect to see an average increase of about $13 per month on their bills. Baltimore Gas and Electric customers were expected to see one of the larger increases, at $16 per month.
But regulators stepped in, requiring the utility to suspend the cost increases in the summer and winter, when bills are higher because customers are using more energy to heat and cool their homes.
As a result though, typical BGE customers will see an estimated monthly bill increase of $30 this fall and spring, according to the Office of People’s Counsel.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC06073-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-22 20:57:33.115614

(Courtesy Louder than Guns)After a high profile string of deadly shootings, Democratic lawmakers in the state House are moving to tighten Pennsylvania’s firearm laws.
The House Judiciary committee passed four bills on Monday. One would institute red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to temporarily seize people’s firearms if a judge rules them a likely danger to themself or others. 
The others would ban devices that convert semi-automatic guns to automatic fire, require background checks for long gun purchases, and ban weapons that can avoid magnetometer detection, like 3D printed “ghost guns.”
The hearing followed the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event on the Utah Valley University Campus in Utah earlier this month. That same day, a gunman killed one student and injured two others at a high school outside Denver, Colorado. And last week, three law enforcement officers were killed during a shootout in York County while investigating a reported stalker.

While all four bills advanced along party lines, the hearing was, at times, contentious.  
One Republican lawmaker, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton), said they amount to “an attempt by the left to try to disarm the opposition.”
“None of the bills today will ever single save a single innocent life, because criminals don’t obey laws, and everyone knows that,” she added. “If we wanted to save innocent lives, they would work to put God and the Bible back into our schools, and restore the nuclear family.”
Republicans, in the minority on the committee, broadly characterized the bills as infringements on the Second Amendment and, in some cases, redundant given existing laws. Most made efforts to respectfully engage their Democratic colleagues.
“I do not question the passion or the motive of either side,” Rep. Tim Bonner (R-Mercer) said. “As legislators elected by the people, we take our oath to enforce the Constitution and to enforce the laws that have been adopted.”

The Second Amendment, he said, is “sacred in our Constitution.” 
Democrats framed the measures as a public safety-oriented approach that square with the Constitution.
“The [Second Amendment] does not grant the ability to possess any weapon whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,” said Rep. Emily Kinkead (D-Allegheny), citing a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that set precedent for subsequent  Second Amendment cases.
Kinkead also invoked the First Amendment. While all Americans have the right to free speech, there are still laws around slander, libel, terroristic threats, intellectual property and more, she said.
“No right under the Constitution is unlimited,” she said.
To become law, the bills would have to pass a vote on the full House floor, where Democrats have a single-vote majority, then pass the Republican-controlled Senate.
“Lives are lost every day to guns across the commonwealth,” said Adam Garber, executive director of the group Ceasefire PA. “So we’re hoping the House moves quickly for a vote and the Senate … puts people’s lives first.” 
A ‘Red flag’ law
House Bill 1859 would temporarily prohibit someone from possessing firearms if they’re determined to be at risk of physically harming themselves or others as demonstrated by the person threatening or attempting suicide or violence, or recklessly brandishing a firearm, within the past year. Other factors the court would consider include substance use, recent gun purchases and animal cruelty. 
The measure mirrors red flag laws enacted in Washington, D.C., and more than a dozen states. They include Connecticut and Indiana, where provisions took effect more than two decades ago.
In Pennsylvania, the current proposal matches one from last session, which built on legislation from 2021, to establish extreme risk protection orders (ERPO’s) in the commonwealth.
Attendees with Ceasefire PA hold signs at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Sept. 22, 2025 (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)
It would allow an ERPO to be pursued by police, a relative or household member of the person thought to be at risk of harming themselves or others. The court would schedule a hearing within three to 10 days and, in the meantime, could issue a temporary order prohibiting the respondent from possessing firearms. In that case, the judge would simultaneously issue a search warrant for – and seize – any firearms and concealed carry permits.
At the hearing, the court could extend the seizure to three to 12 months. Law enforcement or a licensed dealer would keep the firearms; the defendant also could appeal.
Anyone who tries to leverage the process improperly – such as making false reports – would face a third-degree felony along with having to pay restitution plus the target’s legal and incurred costs.
Borowicz objected to the bill, saying it would violate due process.
“The police show up, you lose all of your firearms, and then you have a trial?” she said. “That’s not how it works in America.”
Rep. Robert Leadbeter (R-Columbia), who recently introduced a bill designed to prevent red flag laws in Pennsylvania, said he’s opposing the measure because of potential costs for defendants, constitutional rights violations and the “unacceptable” 10-day waiting period.
He also said it’s unnecessary because of laws already on the books for stalking, terroristic threats and involuntary mental health commitment.
“[Pennsylvania’s involuntary mental health commitment law] does not go far enough when it comes to addressing people who would commit harm,” countered Kinkead. “To say that 302 is sufficient, is to say that the only people who use guns to harm other people in this way are people who have severe mental illness.”
The measure also aims to prevent suicide, Kinkead noted.
Sponsor Jennifer O’Mara (D-Delaware) has cited her father’s suicide in her appeals for support of the legislation and its predecessor from last session. 
A Pew Research Center analysis showed in 2023, neary six in 10 gun-related deaths in the country were suicides (27,300).

Critics and supporters of establishing red flag laws in Pennsylvania have cited conflicting research on their effectiveness in states that already have them. Committee Chairman Tim Briggs (D-Montgomery) previously pointed to research from the University of Indianapolis tying them to a drop in suicide rates, while minority chair Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Franklin) on Monday raised a RAND corporation research review citing weaknesses with studies of ERPO laws’ impacts.
A 2024 study linked ERPO laws with a decline in homicide rates. 
Banning Glock switches and ‘undetectable’ guns
A bill introduced by Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny) would ban  Machine Gun Conversion Devices, firearm modifications intended to make semi-automatic weapons fire at the same rate as automatic ones. 
Steele said the bill was sponsored in honor of former Brackenridge Police Chief Justin McIntyre, who was shot and killed on the line of duty in Allegheny County in 2023.
“His surviving family wants these senseless, Lego-sized gun conversion devices, which can turn a Glock into a machine gun, off the streets,” Steele said. “So does every police chief that I represent, and I represent a lot of police chiefs. Our police will be safer and their jobs will be easier.”
Generally, the term refers to Glock switches or autosears, small firearm accessories that can turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones.
Those are already illegal under federal law. Still, municipalities around Pennsylvania — as well as states run by both Democrats and Republicans — have passed laws to ban them.
A display of ‘ghost guns’ displayed by Attorney General Josh Shapiro’s office during a Capitol news conference on Monday, Dec. 16, 2019 (Photo by Pennsylvania Capital-Star).
That’s in part because the devices are illegal under the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms’ interpretation of the National Firearms Act – not  explicit congressional action. With presidential administrations taking drastically different approaches to firearms law enforcement, the laws insulate states from changing interpretation or enforcement. They also make it easier for state and local law enforcement to bring charges against those who violate the law.
A memo seeking co-sponsors for the bill says it would also ban bump stocks, a device used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, the deadliest in modern American history. The devices can increase a firearm’s rate of fire by allowing the shooter to fire using the impact of recoil. They do not, however, turn a semiautomatic gun into an automatic one. 
Following the Las Vegas shooting, President Donald Trump, in his first term, moved to ban bump stocks. The move received pushback from hardline Second Amendment supporters  and eventually was ruled illegal by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Still, several states and municipalities have banned the devices themselves. Last month, a Court of Common Pleas judge in Philadelphia upheld the city’s own ban on the devices. Delaware County and the city of York also have enacted bans. 
Opposing the bill, Kauffman noted that bump stocks and other firearm accessories that increase their rate of fire are intended to make shooting easier for disabled people.
Leadbeter also spoke in opposition of the bill, calling the conversion device ban redundant in the face of federal law.
“Possession of these devices are already prohibited, with only a very limited exception,” he said. “Making these devices triply illegal? I can’t see the intent beyond virtue signaling.”
Kinkead, however, noted that lawmakers often pass laws that mirror federal regulations.
“This is my fifth year in office, and we have created so many crimes and passed so many laws that have mirrored or copied other statutes at the federal level,” she said. “Yet, these arguments were never made about how, under those laws, we couldn’t possibly pass those because criminals wouldn’t listen.”
Another measure would ban firearms made entirely of non-metal materials, or not containing at least one major component made entirely of metal. The number of “ghost guns” — homemade, unserialized firearms — recovered at crime scenes has spiked since 2017.  In recent years, they’ve become much more accessible with increased availability of 3D printers. If made without metal, the guns can avoid detection by magnetometers.
Like Machine Gun Conversion Devices, ghost guns have already been banned by numerous local governments across Pennsylvania. The state House also passed another bill earlier this year to ban the sale of ghost gun kits, which contain parts that can be assembled into a firearm at home. 
A fourth bill, from Rep. Perry Warren (D-Bucks), would require background checks for the sale and transfer of long guns, which is not currently required.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Loudeer-than-guns-Pistols-for-sale-at-a-gun-shop-in-KY-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-22 20:57:33.115614

(Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republicans in North Carolina’s legislature began advancing a package of changes to the state’s criminal justice system Monday, moving to streamline the state’s death penalty process and tighten pre-trial release requirements after a killing on Charlotte’s light rail last month sparked national attention.
The bill, titled “Iryna’s Law,” serves as lawmakers’ response to the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in late August. Security video of the killing, released earlier this month, immediately garnered headlines and scrutiny — from local and state leaders up to President Donald Trump.
Senators approved the bill Monday evening, 28-8. All eight votes against the measure were Democrats; several others were not present for the vote. The bill now heads to the House, where it is expected to earn majority approval.
The plan is broadly informed by the circumstances of Zarutska’s case: Decarlos Brown, who has been charged with her murder, was homeless, reportedly suffered from untreated mental illness, served six years for armed robbery and had been arrested multiple times.
“North Carolinians deserve to live in safe communities without fear of violent criminals being cycled in and out of the justice system,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) said in a news release Sunday.
House Bill 307 would eliminate cashless bail in some circumstances. And it changes pre-trial options for defendants accused of “violent offenses” and repeat offenders, requiring either secured bond or house arrest with GPS monitoring. “Written promises” to appear in court for a hearing would be eliminated under the bill.
Repeat offenders who have previously been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital would also face an exam to decide whether they should be re-committed. Arresting officers would “immediately transport” those offenders to a hospital for that exam. (The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association said Monday they supported the legislation.)
Magistrates who oversee preliminary court hearings would also see additional layers of scrutiny. They would be specifically judged on “timeliness and conflicts of interests,” and would be subject to suspension by Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Newby.
Bill pursues new path to resume executions
The bill also aims to streamline aspects of the state’s capital punishment process, putting stricter rules on defendants’ ability to appeal and allowing courts to consider public transit as a potential “aggravating factor” when sentencing for violent crimes. And cases in which the death penalty is being sought would proceed in their county of conviction, rather than solely in Wake County.
Sen. Danny Britt (R-Hoke) said cases were “going on too long without a family ever seeing justice for their loved ones.”
“This is an effort to try and speed these up,” Britt said.
Executions have been on pause for almost two decades in North Carolina, amid continuing legal and regulatory challenges. But language inserted into the bill by Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) on Monday evening would allow the state to continue pursuing executions.

Lethal injection would remain the state’s default method of execution under the bill. But if a court finds the method to be unconstitutional, the Department of Adult Corrections would be required to adopt another method, one already adopted by other states. That could include the electric chair or a firing squad.
“We’ve allowed bureaucracy and arguments unrelated to the case, and challenges over equipment and professionals and chemicals, to take back ultimate justice out of our society,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) said.
Department officials would have about four months to update their guidelines on executions following that court ruling. After those rules are established, defendants’ executions would be set within two months.
Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) said Berger’s amendment sets up “arbitrary timelines and shot clocks on judicial action” that “makes it more likely that we will execute innocent people.”
In response, Sen. Carl Ford (R-Rowan) said that “when someone has committed a heinous crime, and there’s proof of it without a shadow of a doubt, you can sign me up to pull the trigger.”
Sen. Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg), who met with Zarutska’s family after her death, said he had previously intended to vote for the bill. But Berger’s changes to the death penalty lost his support.
“Shame on each and every one of us,” he said.
Democrats: Bill should fund public defenders, mental health
The Republicans’ plan orders a study on mental health and its intersection with the justice system. But it does not appropriate money or make any specific directives on mental health initiatives and treatment — which opponents say is a critical flaw, along with a shortage of public defenders.
“Investing in prosecutors is absolutely what we need to do, but we also need to invest in public defenders’ offices,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said. “If we’re sitting here trying to figure out how to best keep our communities safe, it’s also going to come with more investment.”
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, has said he supports more accountability for magistrates and to examine defendants facing mental health crises.
Britt acknowledged Monday that there was “more work to do” on mental health treatment. He called the bill “a start, but not a finish.”
Senate Democrats also voiced wide-ranging concerns on other parts of the bill, including its changes to capital punishment.
“I cannot support a bill that expedites the death penalty in our state,” said Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham). “I wish we would consider those solutions that are both efficient and compassionate.”
And Liz Barber, with the ACLU of North Carolina, warned that the bill’s changes could extend already significant wait times at psychiatric facilities.
“Unless the mental health care system is fully funded, then the involuntary commitment process is a road to nowhere,” Barber said.
Democrats sought to amend the bill Monday to include additional mental health funding, without success.

Mohammed proposed spending $5 million to train magistrates on mental health law and other topics. And Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Granville) requested additional money to train law enforcement. Both measures were overruled by Republicans.
Mohammed also proposed banning the use of crime victims’ names, images and likenesses in political advertising. Zarutska’s death appears likely to surface as a campaign issue in the ongoing U.S. Senate contest; Michael Whatley, the Republican candidate, appeared alongside Hall and Berger in a news conference about the legislation last week.
That amendment, along with others proposed by Democrats, were overruled by Republicans and discarded without votes.
The crime bill is at the center of this week’s session at Jones Street, but the General Assembly is also considering several spending bills funding specific parts of the budget. House and Senate leaders remain at an impasse on the broader annual budget.

(Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)
New Mexico’s National Guard Adjutant General announced Monday that guardsmen will soon be deployed to Española, a town of roughly 10,000 people in Northern New Mexico whose leaders recently asked for state help dealing with a crime, drug and housing crisis. 
Española will be the second New Mexico city to receive National Guard troops. Albuquerque, the state’s biggest city, has seen a monthslong troop deployment in support of the Albuquerque Police Department. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham authorized the deployments to both cities in emergency orders that cite rising crime and short-staffed law enforcement agencies. The governor’s Aug. 13 emergency order for the Española area authorized National Guard deployments, along with funding for emergency housing or healthcare help. Her office stressed at the time that there were no imminent plans to deploy National Guard troops to Española.
According to the executive order, police calls in the Española area have doubled in the last two years, and police dispatches to businesses have quadrupled in that same period. She also cited Rio Arriba County’s high overdose death rate, “with residents struggling with addiction to fentanyl and other illicit substances.” Lujan Grisham’s order also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending. Last week, the state health department reported Rio Arriba County is one of three in Northern New Mexico with surging overdose deaths and overdose emergency room visits.

While the decision has now been made to send them, the number of troops, as well as their assignment, is still being determined, Miguel Aguilar told Source New Mexico on Monday after presenting in Albuquerque  to the interim Courts, Corrections and Criminal Justice committee of the Legislature. 
“We don’t even know what the number is going to be,” Aguilar told Source. “It’s just a matter of what the scope is.”
Aguilar and Española Police Chief Mizel Garcia presented to the committee to answer questions about the role the guard could play in Española and elsewhere, and to address swirling controversy about President Donald Trump’s use of the National Guard in American cities, including Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. 
Aguilar said his troops’ presence in Albuquerque since April has freed up Albuquerque police to make more arrests. The National Guard has taken some administrative tasks off police officers’ hands, including compiling case files for prosecutors, directing traffic and monitoring surveillance cameras. 
Garcia said the guard will be useful in his town, assisting an under-staffed police department in some form. But he acknowledged that their deployment could face public opposition.

“My biggest concern right now is fear,” he said. “Because of the cultural background that we have in Espanola, there’s always been a fear of the National Guard coming in.”
He said he and his staff had multiple community meetings in recent weeks, in which they sought to reassure the community that police and the guard are working together “as a team.” 
Garcia said the troops’ arrival could occur as soon as early October.
Several lawmakers said they were concerned about the prospect of an expanded military presence in New Mexico communities, especially given Trump’s use of the guard.
Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) said defining a mission for the guard’s deployment in Española is vital, as is more clarity about who is in charge and who is accountable. 
“I’m currently not understanding the strategy, even looking to Albuquerque as a way in which I can try to understand what’s going to happen in Española,” she said. 
The committee invited Naureen Shah, an expert and attorney for the national American Civil Liberties Union, to lay out her concerns about civil rights for civilians who are increasingly interacting with domestic military forces. 
She said that, while she does not pretend to understand all the local forces that might be used to justify the guard’s presence in New Mexico, deploying the guard here gives Trump cover.
“This administration wants to be able to deploy the military at the president’s whim as a tool against his political opponents,” she said. “And the more that happens at a state level, the more it normalizes it for the Trump administration.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0998-e1758586979607-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-09-22 20:57:33.115614

After the Wyoming senator told a reporter last week her feelings had changed about the First Amendment, Lummis says her position hasn’t shifted at all. 
The post Where does Sen. Lummis stand on freedom of speech? appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis has made national headlines for reportedly changing the way she feels about freedom of speech, but her office disputes that characterization.
“Under normal times, in normal circumstances, I tend to think that the First Amendment should always be sort of the ultimate right. And that there should be almost no checks and balances on it. I don’t feel that way anymore,” Lummis told Semafor, a digital news site, last week. 
The senator’s comments followed the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s TV show after the late-night comedian commented on Charlie Kirk’s accused assassin. Disney, ABC’s parent company, removed Kimmel from the air after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr publicly threatened investigations and regulatory action. 
Ahead of ABC’s Monday announcement that Kimmel would return to the air this week, Lummis weighed in, telling Semafor that “an FCC license, it’s not a right. It really is a privilege.”
Like many members of the GOP, Lummis has often championed free speech. 
“There are no ifs, ands or buts about the First Amendment and it is time for @POTUS and unelected bureaucrats in D.C. to abide by the Constitution,” Lummis posted on X on July 25, 2023. 
At the time, she and Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky introduced the Free Speech Protection Act, “to prohibit federal employees and contractors from directing platforms to censor any speech that is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,” according to the bill text. 
The legislation was in response to a lawsuit brought by attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri against the Biden administration. The federal government carried out a far-reaching censorship campaign, according to the complaint, in its efforts to convince social media companies to address postings related to COVID-19. In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the case. 
“I take the protection of the privacy and individual liberties of the people of Wyoming extremely serious,” Lummis wrote in a July 21, 2023 press release. “If we let the Biden administration restrict our freedom of speech, there is no telling what other sacred freedoms they will come for next.” 
Circumstances have changed, Lummis told Semafor last week. 
“I feel like something’s changed culturally. And I think that there needs to be some cognizance that things have changed,” Lummis said. “We just can’t let people call each other those kinds of insane things and then be surprised when politicians get shot and the death threats they are receiving and then trying to get extra money for security.” 
Asked to provide more of an explanation as to what caused Lummis to change her position on the First Amendment, Joe Jackson, a spokesman for the senator, asked WyoFile to print the following statement in full. 
“Senator Lummis’s position hasn’t shifted at all. She remains among Congress’ most vocal First Amendment champions. The First Amendment applies to federal and state governments and does not prevent private companies from firing employees who endorse and cheer political assassinations. The Left enthusiastically supported Biden’s censorship regime and stayed quiet when Democrats branded their rivals as Nazis. But when Senator Lummis criticizes Democrats for their inflammatory rhetoric that promotes violence, they suddenly act like they care about free speech. This double standard is precisely why nobody believes them,” the statement read. 
In a follow-up, WyoFile asked if Lummis could clarify what she meant by “I don’t feel that way anymore” in her comments to Semafor. “Her point was we can’t normalize speech that incites this level of violence,” Jackson responded.
The “insane things” people say and call each other are protected by the First Amendment, Jackson wrote. 
“However, we must recognize the drastic consequences and violence from the Left its resulting in. In this case, the murder of a young husband and father,” Jackson wrote. “The media is working overtime to try and mischaracterize her comments instead of focusing on the real issue: leftwing political violence.”
Some GOP senators, however, have raised concerns about FCC pressure on ABC, including Sen. Paul, the co-sponsor with Lummis on the Free Speech Protection Act. He told Meet the Press on Sunday that Carr had “no business weighing in on this.”
While people could get fired for making “despicable comments,” Paul said, the government should not pressure companies to take action. 
“The government’s got no business in it. And the FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I’ll fight any attempt by the government to get involved with speech,” Paul said. 
On his podcast Friday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he was “thrilled” to see Kimmel’s show taken off the air, but called Carr’s actions “dangerous as hell.”
Cruz, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, which has oversight authority over the FCC, said it “will end up bad for conservatives.”
“They will silence us,” he said. “They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly.”

Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who resigned. (courtesy of Daniel Bass) OMAHA — Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts launched his reelection bid last weekend at R&R Realty Group and kicked off a three-day tour of the state.
Ricketts looks to win his first full six-year term after winning a special election in 2024 to finish the final two years of former Nebraska U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who resigned. Ricketts faces a populist challenger in a race already garnering national attention. 
“Conservative leadership matters,” Ricketts said. “Conservative leadership delivers.”
As expected, President Donald Trump joined prominent Republicans in endorsing Ricketts, a former two-term governor and political force in the state. In his campaign kickoff, Ricketts highlighted working with the Legislature as governor to deliver $12.7 billion in tax relief. 
Ricketts also touted his Senate votes for Trump’s budget and tax bill this summer, saying “it delivers the largest tax cut in American history.” He highlighted its new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less and how it boosted funding for immigration enforcement. 
The law makes tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for high earners, starts funding Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program and accomplishes other goals from Trump’s domestic agenda.
Ricketts said he is fighting to keep the same conservative leadership in Washington, D.C., that he said has delivered results for Nebraska and for America.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Ricketts to the Senate in 2023, when he replaced Sasse after Sasse resigned to become president of the University of Florida. Ricketts easily defeated Preston Love Jr. in 2024. But Ricketts has acknowledged his race against former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn will be “tough.” 
Osborn, like Ricketts, has been holding listening sessions around the state, and he ran a closer-than-expected race in 2024 against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, who defeated him by six percentage points.

“I need your help because I’m kicking off my reelection here, and it’s going to be a tough one,” Ricketts told the Omaha crowd. “He says he’s an independent, but he voted against Trump. He says He’s independent, but … 95% of his money came from outside the state of Nebraska.” 
Ricketts called Osborn a “fake” independent. Osborn quickly responded by telling Omaha NBC affiliate WOWT, “If you want to talk about fake, how about buying your way into the Senate with your dad’s money … so I would say he’s a fake senator.”
The latest spat is a hint of how much different the race will be compared to Osborn’s bid against Fischer, who largely ignored him until the last few months.
Ricketts and his political team have said they won’t let Osborn fly under the radar. Some regional and national Republican strategists have said the GOP will work to “expose” him.
Omaha was the first stop for Ricketts’ statewide tour. He also planned stops at Kearney, North Platte, Scottsbluff, Norfolk and Beatrice.

Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’s been “disappointed” that thus far Senate leadership in her own party has declined to include interstate medical compacts on the agenda.","The New Mexico state Capitol. Lawmakers will reconvene for a special session on Oct. 1 (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)With just a week left before a special New Mexico legislative session begins, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’s been “disappointed” that thus far Senate leadership in her own party has declined to include interstate medical compacts on the agenda.
Such compacts would allow health care workers licensed in other states to work in New Mexico, which advocates say would address the state’s shortage of medical professionals. New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House, but all stalled in the state Senate.
Earlier this month, the governor said the special session would primarily focus on federal cuts to programs such as Medicaid. She has also indicated the agenda was set in negotiations with lawmakers in the majority party, as previous special sessions without prior agreements have tended to fall apart.
However, on Friday, policy group Think New Mexico —which has advocated for interstate compacts —warned the state could lose out on millions of federal dollars for rural hospitals if lawmakers don’t move to approve agreements before a November deadline. The governor in turn urged lawmakers to reconsider including the issue when lawmakers convene on Oct. 1.
“I’m going to keep pushing, and frankly, at this point, fingers crossed,” Lujan Grisham said.
Lujan Grisham still has not released the official proclamation that sets the topics and timing for the session, but is likely to do so shortly before lawmakers convene, much like the special session last year.
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a statement Monday he remains opposed to adding medical compacts to the special session agenda. “Healthcare policy should not be held hostage to short-term grant deadlines,” Wirth said. “Making permanent changes to professional licensing standards based on temporary funding availability and an ever-changing set of rules coming from the federal government sets a dangerous precedent.”
Wirth also argued in his statement that lawmakers “need the time” between now and next year’s January session “to examine how interstate compacts would interact with New Mexico’s existing laws and ensure that any changes truly serve the long-term interests of providers and patients.”
While Senate Democrats may not be persuaded, Republican lawmakers  are already on board and pushed for inclusion of health worker compacts as part of the special session agenda last week in a letter to the governor’s office.
“Failing to address interstate medical compacts is going to make the special session far less special for New Mexicans seeking results,” Senate Floor Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) told Source NM in a statement.
In comments to reporters Monday, Lujan Grisham noted that Republicans don’t have the votes to circumvent the Democratic majority.
“I know the Republicans are anxious and disappointed, and some of them are a bit angry about this. They don’t have the votes. If they can show me a path where they can get something on the floor, and they can get Democratic votes, well, that maybe that would entertain a different response,” she said.
Compacts aside, Lujan Grisham said she remains committed to using the special session to address shortfalls from the federal budget bill.
“I need to do everything in my power to make sure that we stabilize health care coverage for the Mexicans and food security,” Lujan Grisham said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Andrea Chamblee thinks her late husband, John McNamara, would be “humbled and kind of flabbergasted” to see the highway marker in his honor.
But she also thinks the sign dedicating Annapolis’ Rowe Boulevard to “The Capital Gazette Five” is an important reminder.
The sign, dedicated Monday, is in memory of the five employees of the Capital Gazette newspaper who lost their lives on June 28, 2018, when a gunman opened fire in the newsroom. Besides McNamara, the victims were Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters.
“I want them [motorists] to think about the environment where it’s still dangerous to be a journalist,” Chamblee said during a brief interview. “It’s dangerous to tell the truth. These people told the truth with transparency and kindness. I hope this sign reminds people to not take that for granted.”
Family, friends and colleagues attended Monday’s unveiling. The highway marker is the city’s second memorial to the Capital Gazette victims, after the dedication of the Guardians of the First Amendment Memorial at Newman Street Park in 2021.
But speakers Monday said the memorials are about more than just the shootings.

“Today’s marker is more than recognizing them in that tragic moment. It’s to remind all of us of something that’s very important: The First Amendment is the most important amendment that we have in this Constitution,” said Carl Snowden, convener of the Council of African American Leaders, which advocated for the highway marker.
“When we unveil this marker, we want to say it loud and clear to all who are here, the media is not the enemy of the people,” he said.
The marker sits just down the street from the State House, where it will be seen by lawmakers and people coming to make their voices heard. That includes Chamblee, a member of the Howard County Board of Education who became active with the Maryland chapter of Moms Demand Action, which seeks to end gun violence and engage in suicide prevention, after her husband’s killing.
Justin Towles, chair of the Maryland Transportation Commission, said his group debated “pretty vigorously” to determine whether the marker met the charge to recognize individuals of significance to the state.
“Our commission was not comfortable moving forward unless we knew that we could look at every single one of these individuals and be comfortable that it was not this tragedy that made them significant, but it was the life that they lived,” said Towles, who grew up in Anne Arundel County and knew a few of the victims
“We decided that this dedication, while for the Capital Gazette Five, it is not honoring the tragedy that happened,” he said. “It is honoring those five individuals for each being a Marylander of significance and we’re comfortable doing that.”
Winters Larca, daughter of Wendi Winters, said she appreciates the gesture to honor her mother and the other Capital Gazette employees.
“I’m happy that there is a permanent memorial dedicated to them and that it’s something as significant as part of Rowe Boulevard, which is the critical junction into the city,” she said during a brief interview. “Obviously it doesn’t bring them back, but it’s nice to know other people are thinking about them too, even all these years later.”

This story by John Lippman was first published by the Valley News on Sept. 21.
NORWICH — The mystery of a car that was stolen in the dead of the night from a farm in Norwich and then vanished has been solved. Now the car’s owner has invited the thief to a dessert party because of the bond they share.
The safe and happy outcome on Thursday began with an unsettling scene caught by surveillance cameras early the previous Sunday morning. Footage showed an older man in pajamas shuffling about Sweetland Farm before driving off in a red 2017 Honda HR-V, which had been parked behind the farm store and belonged to one of the farm’s employees.
Shelagh Harvard, a Sweetland Farm employee who lives in a house behind the farm store, said she happened to be awake reading in bed in the early Sunday morning hours when she heard “revving in the driveway” from outside her window.
She said it was not unusual for her to leave the keys in her car. “It’s a farm, you know,” Harvard said.
At first, Harvard told the Valley News in an interview Thursday morning, she thought the motor sound might be coming from a vehicle belonging to guests who had been attending a wedding party down the road and were using Sweetland Farm’s store lot for parking.
“But then I thought a few minutes later, OK, what if it’s not and I got up to look out and my car was gone,” Harvard said. Although it was past 3 a.m., she immediately called 911 to report that her car had just been stolen.
Harvard, who has managed Sweetland Farm’s farm store for three years, has only owned the bright red 2017 Honda H-RV for a few months.
The farm store has outdoor surveillance cameras, and when Harvard and police reviewed the video footage, it showed images of an older man dressed in what appeared to be pajamas and carrying what looked like a blanket or clothing in one arm and wandering about the property.
Camera footage also captured the man struggling to maneuver Harvard’s vehicle with him “reversing the wrong way … he had a heck of a time just getting out of my driveway, like five minutes just to get to the road” before heading south on Route 132 and vanishing out of the camera’s range, Harvard related.Vermont State Police, in a news release asking for the public’s help in locating Harvard’s stolen vehicle, said it was last observed “traveling into Hanover.”Hanover Police Capt. Michael Schibuola said police had received a “be on the lookout” alert for the red Honda H-RV and a “possible vehicle matching the description was seen on a camera going south” on South Main Street toward Lebanon. The information was passed along to Lebanon and Hartford police.After that, Harvard’s car appeared to vanish into thin air with no further sightings.
But Harvard said what she saw on the surveillance video did not strike her as a typical car theft. For one, the video showed that the trespasser was on the property for about two hours, opening the doors of other vehicles parked in the lot and seeming not to be in any hurry.
“You wouldn’t take a couple hours to do that,” Harvard said. A real thief “would be in-and-out.”

Harvard said what she saw on the surveillance appeared to be the behavior of person who might be suffering from something of which she is familiar — dementia.
Harvard is the niece of Andy Harvard, a world-class mountaineer who ran the Dartmouth Outing Club. He died at age 69 in 2019 after being diagnosed with early onset of Alzheimer’s 10 years earlier.
In 2008, claiming performance issues, Dartmouth fired Andy Harvard, an alum, from his post as director of the outdoors program. Nine months later, he was diagnosed with the uncommon form of dementia that strikes people younger than 65.
He and his wife, Kathy Harvard, battled Dartmouth for years to get the college to recognize that his disease was at the root of the reasons for his dismissal, but they were not able to reach a settlement.
“My fear was that it was an elderly man who lives alone and nobody’s reported missing and therefore he is not missed and is in trouble,” Shelagh Harvard said.
Shelagh Harvard contacted Norwich Community Nurse Mary Stevens to ask whether she knew anyone who fit the description of the man in the surveillance video.
She also posted notices on the Hanover, Thetford and Stafford Listservs, asking people to “please help find my car” and noting camera footage shows “an individual that police say may be an elderly male allegedly involved in the theft.”
Stevens said when she watched the video of the shadowy figure shuffling about her reaction “knowing what I know about what people with dementia look like” was that it depicted “someone who was confused and looking for something.”
Stevens in turn shared the video with the community nursing group’s board chair, the town’s former community nurse and Norwich’s fire chief to ask if the man in the video could be anyone they might be familiar with.
“None of them recognized him,” Stevens said, which only increased worries that the man “must be somebody who lives alone. Where did he go? It’s concerning.”
Stevens said she even took it upon herself to drive roads nearby Sweetland Farm, such as Academy Road and Kerwin Hill Road, to look for a red Honda H-RV perhaps parked in a driveway.
But without any trace of Shelagh Harvard’s car, the unidentified man “could have driven it into the river for all we know,” Stevens said.
Shelagh Harvard’s decision to post a plea on online bulletin boards turned out to be a smart move.
On Thursday afternoon, Shelagh Harvard said she was contacted by a woman who lives near Sweetland Farm to report that Harvard’s car was at her ex-husband’s apartment at his senior living residence in West Lebanon.The woman said her 81-year-old former husband, for whom she has been caring while his dementia worsens, was staying at her Norwich residence on Saturday and unknown to her had wandered off in the middle of the night. The next day the woman received a call from people at her former husband’s senior living complex reporting that he was walking around and “appeared confused,” Shelagh Harvard said the woman told her.
Shelagh Harvard said she does not know how the woman realized that her former husband had driven back to his residence with her car. But in any case the woman made the connection to Shelagh Harvard’s car and the red Honda H-RV at her former husband’s residence when she read a post on one of the online bulletin boards.
“She was apologizing a bunch and I said, ‘You know what? I totally understand and I’m so glad he’s OK and nobody else is hurt,’” Shelagh Harvard said, telling the caller that she is very familiar with dementia due to the experience of her uncle, Andy Harvard.
By happenstance, Shelagh Harvard added, she informed the caller that on Oct. 4 she plans to host her Third Annual Dessert Night Alzheimer’s Walk Benefit at her aunt, Kathy Harvard’s, home in Hanover.
Shelagh Harvard organizes the dessert party annually to raise awareness and funds for dementia research in advance of the Oct. 26 Alzheimer’s walk in Hanover.
“She said, ‘That would so wonderful. This is so isolating. It would just be so nice to be with people who understand what I’m going through,” Shelagh Harvard said.
On Friday afternoon, after Shelagh Harvard had gone to West Lebanon to retrieve her car, she confirmed that the woman would be attending the Oct. 4 dessert party for Alzheimer’s research with a plus one: her former husband.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)With time running short,  the state Senate approved additional money for Medicaid insurance to avoid threatened payment reductions to a broad range of health care providers, which legislators warned could result in sick people losing their medical care. 
The Senate added $90 million to $600 million already approved to cover Medicaid cost increases from inflation, changes in the types of care delivered, and other factors, and added $83.6 million for Medicaid administration. 
The hitch is that Senate wrapped $103.5 million for a children’s hospital into the bill, which House Republicans have said they don’t want included. If  the General Assembly doesn’t approve more Medicaid money soon, the state Department of Health and Human Services has said it will cut health care provider payment rates.
The medical funding bill was one of eight directing spending to discrete areas of state government that the Senate approved Monday. Republicans in the state House and Senate have not been able to agree on a comprehensive spending plan for the budget year that began July 1. Legislators are debating mini-budgets instead.
The legislature allocated $600 million to cover changes in the state’s Medicaid program in a stopgap budget approved in July, but that was short of the $819 million DHHS  said is needed. In response, DHHS announced it would reduce payments to a wide range of health care providers beginning Oct. 1. 
Looming over the debate over House bill 562 was the prospect of patients losing health care and medical workers losing their jobs if the House does not agree to a medical funding bill that includes the children’s hospital. 
Democrats in the House and Senate asked for a “clean” bill dealing only with the additional money for Medicaid, fearing an impasse between House and Senate Republicans will trigger reduced payments to providers who will then cut medical services. 
“People with disabilities are in a blind panic over this,” Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said in the Senate budget committee. Grafstein said she supports the children’s hospital, but if the House rejects the Senate budget proposal, the hospital doesn’t get its money and the health care is cut. 
“Somebody with a disability who relies on Medicaid day after day after day, they may lose their provider,” she said. “Little providers are going to go out of business. These cuts are going to hit them hard.”
Sen. Michael Lee (R-New Hanover) said the legislature agreed in 2023 to fund the children’s hospital, and the Senate proposal makes good on the final installment. The money is coming from the 2021 federal COVID-19 relief fund, called the American Rescue Plan Act, he said. “There are people relying on it, they’ve been relying on it, they’ve made plans on it, and we need to do it.”
The Senate approved the bill unanimously, despite Democrats’ warnings that it may die in the House.
At a press conference Monday, a group of House Democrats also pushed for a bill that excludes any provisions that might derail the additional Medicaid funding.

An impasse will result in people losing lifesaving services, said Rep. Julia Greenfield (D-Mecklenburg). 
“They are playing with our lives,” she said. “Your health should never, ever  be a bargaining chip.”
Speakers at a rally Monday morning outside the Legislative Building spoke about the importance of passing a comprehensive budget and fully funding Medicaid.
Patrick Dunnagan of Raleigh talked about how massive kidney failure transformed his life at age 25, and how Medicaid was crucial to his treatment.
Dunnagan said he went from enjoying outdoor adventures to losing his health, his job, his independence, and the ability to stay alive on his own.
“As kidney disease began to reshape my life, Medicaid was there to help make sure I had access to emergency treatments and surgeries,” he said.
Among the other bills the Senate considered would provide raises to law enforcement officers, fund construction projects and support economic development plans.
 Senate Republicans block Planned Parenthood from Medicaid dollars 
The Senate approved House bill 192,  which would prohibit Planned Parenthood from participating in Medicaid.
North Carolina Republicans have worked to curtail Planned Parenthood in recent years, but the organization could still receive $830,000 through Medicaid, said Sen. Amy Galey (R-Alamance).
Witnesses spoke against the measure in committee.
Senator Amy Galey (R-Alamance Co.)
Paige Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said the bill is about playing politics.
“It is about taking health care away from the people who need it,” she said.
If the bill becomes law, North Carolinians would lose access to birth control, cancer screenings, and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, Johnson said.
Michaela Barnes, a 14th generation North Carolinian, said her family has been in the area since 1660. Her ancestors fought in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.
“I am going through a divorce right now in a domestic violence situation where the only option that I had was Planned Parenthood,” Barnes said. “Medicaid is used to give life saving health care to those who cannot afford it.”
Another speaker, Morgan Pixa, said the organization helped him with an urgent medical issue when he was not able to receive care from his primary provider.
Galey said she does not support Planned Parenthood providing services because she thinks “they indoctrinate.” Upon questioning from another committee member, she clarified she does not have a medical objection.
“I think that Planned Parenthood is not a good faith organization,” Galey said.
Late in the day, the Senate  passed a bill allocating funds to recovery from Tropical Storm Chantal and other disasters.
The State Emergency Response and Disaster Relief Fund provides $65.5 million in nonrecurring funds for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.
Of this amount, $55 million goes to the Department of Public Safety’s Division of Emergency Management (NCEM) for the State Match Fund and $6 million to NCEM in the form of grants to individuals and families.
The sum also allows $1.5 million to Warren Wilson College and $1 million to the Board of Governors for the University of North Carolina at Asheville, for the purpose of repairing and renovating buildings damaged by Hurricane Helene.
For transportation, the measure appropriates $750,000 to the RDU Airport Authority for costs with expanding direct flights to Dublin, Ireland. Additionally, there will be $3.6 million for hangar improvements at the Tri-County Airport and $10.4 million recurring to the Coastal Carolina Regional Airport Authority for infrastructure needs and site clearing.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4750-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

UCLA and University of California leaders are fighting Trump’s demands for a $1.2 billion settlement over a litany of accusations, including that the campus permits antisemitism.


A federal judge in California today ordered the Trump administration to restore 500 National Institutes of Health grants that it suspended at UCLA in July over accusations the campus tolerates antisemitism.
Judge Rita Lin’s decision provides researchers at the university a major respite as UCLA and University of California leaders contend with Trump’s demands for a $1.2 billion settlement over a litany of accusations, including that the campus permits antisemitism. It’s a claim that more than 600 Jewish members of the University of California community in a public letter say is “misguided and punitive.” Meanwhile, UCLA’s leadership highlighted its efforts to combat antisemitism days before Trump’s settlement demands.“Cutting off hundreds of millions of research funds will do nothing to make UCLA safer for Jews nor diminish antisemitism in the world,” the public letter signed by UC Jewish professors, students, staff and alumni says. 
Last week several UC faculty groups and unions sued to halt the administration from pursuing its settlement demands, describing them as an “unlawful threat of federal funding cuts” to “illegally coerce the UC into suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights.” 
Lin’s decision follows her string of orders since June that have restored hundreds of other UC research grants from multiple agencies. Her injunction is preliminary; the trial is ongoing. Today’s action restores virtually all of the 800 UCLA science grants the government froze in July — a value of more than $500 million. Lin’s order today of restoring 500 National Institutes of Health grants follows her decision last month that 300 National Science Foundation grants suspended in July be restored. The federal government complied with her August order by reversing the freezes.
The science grants pay for research into life-saving drugs, dementia, heart disease in rural areas, robotics education and a whole gamut of science inquiries across the country. They help fuel the country’s research enterprise and are the top source of federal research grants at the UC. The UC system has battled the Trump administration over various efforts to slash its funding since President Donald Trump’s second term began. The science funding is also a key source of income and training for graduate students, who are the next generation of publicly funded academics. 
Lin’s latest order also restores three Department of Transportation grants and an unknown number of Department of Defense grants that the Trump administration terminated this year.Lin gave lawyers for the Trump administration until Sept. 29 to submit a report confirming that they complied with her orders to restore the grants.
How we got here
In June, Lin issued a preliminary injunction, later upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that ordered the Trump administration to restore 114 National Science Foundation grants and several dozen other grants from the Environmental Protection Agency and National Endowment for the Humanities at all UC campuses. 
Then in August, Lin sided with the lawyers for the researchers in undoing the funding freezes for the 300 National Science Foundation grants. The lawyers argued that the Trump administration’s surprising decision in late July to suspend those grants violated Lin’s June injunction.Lin’s latest order similarly says that the federal government violated her June preliminary injunction when it suspended the 500 National Institutes of Health grants at UCLA, also in late July. Core to her rationale is that the science agencies terminated UC grants en masse, in violation of a law, the Administrative Procedure Act, that requires federal agencies to explain in individual detail why the grants were terminated. Her rationale echoes other federal district court rulings about grant terminations.
How this relates to recent Supreme Court decision
Lin’s decision also creates a potential opening for other researchers seeking to challenge their grant terminations after an August U.S. Supreme Court decision seemingly made that process harder. In that decision, the high court said the right venue to sue to get a defunded grant restored is the little-known Court of Federal Claims, not a traditional district court. A slim majority of justices said that plaintiffs need to argue in the Court of Federal Claims to get their money back while they argue in a traditional district court to challenge the policy that led to the grant’s termination in the first place.But Lin concluded that that Supreme Court decision can’t apply to the UC researchers because of a quirk in who can file suit in the Court of Federal Claims. Because research grants are contracts between a university and the federal government, only universities have “standing” to bring a suit to the Court of Federal Claims. The Supreme Court decision didn’t take on the issue of individuals, Lin wrote, but the high court justices still believed plaintiffs should have some way to argue that their funding should be restored.
Here’s how Lin’s order creates an opening: Lawyers for the federal government argued to Lin that because the plaintiffs are individual UC researchers and not the UC campuses themselves, they can’t sue at all to restore their grant funding. But Lin balked at that rationale at the Thursday hearing and in her written order today.“The district courts are the only forum where the UC researchers could defend their constitutional and statutory rights, and the Ninth Circuit has already determined that they may bring their claims here. This Court will not shut its doors to them,” Lin wrote today.She added in her written order that the lawyers for the federal government presented an “extreme” view that the researchers couldn’t sue anywhere, even in the hypothetical scenario in which the federal government terminated “the federal funding of all Black researchers, or every researcher with an Asian last name — and the researchers would have nowhere to sue to undo those wrongs, unless their universities decided to sue in the Court of Federal Claims.”
What the Trump administration has argued
In justifying the grant suspensions in July, the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health each sent UCLA letters accusing the university of using race-based admissions, allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports and not doing enough to address antisemitism on its campus.But California barred public campuses from admitting students based on race in 1996 when voters through a ballot measure ended the practice. Representatives from the two science agencies wrote in July that though UCLA maintains it doesn’t use affirmative action, its “holistic review” admissions process is de-facto race-based admissions.The letter from the National Science Foundation said the agency believes that “UCLA’s ‘holistic review’ admissions process, which considers factors such as an applicant’s neighborhood/zip code, family income, and school profile — and invites the disclosure of an applicant’s race via personal statements — is a transparent attempt to engage in race-based admissions in all but name.” The letter from the National Institutes of Health was virtually identical.While the Supreme Court in 2023 overturned the use of race in college admissions in a 6-3 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that students are free to discuss their identities and how they overcame hardships in admissions essays.“Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,” Roberts wrote.All three criticisms in the agencies’ July letters match the policies Trump is pursuing through executive actions to reshape higher education and the federal government. They also mirror the policy playbook fleshed out in Project 2025, a conservative publication that has shaped Trump’s current term in office.
UCLA addresses antisemitism
The UCLA grant suspensions followed a federal Department of Justice report in July that accused the campus of not doing enough to address antisemitism, particularly related to events during last year’s pro-Palestine protests and encampment. The report came months after UCLA commissioned a task force to investigate antisemitism on campus and come up with recommendations that UCLA leaders said they’d implement.
Students and faculty protesting Israel’s war in Gaza have themselves accused UCLA of bias against them, including Arab, Muslim and Jewish UCLA community members.
Trump’s settlement demand “does not make Jewish students safer,” the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California said in a statement last month. The advocacy group is composed of 39 organizations that offer family services, political advocacy, immigration legal aid and other services.  
The Jewish public affairs committee acknowledged several strides UC and UCLA made to curtail antisemitism and promote safer campuses. “Meaningful progress is already underway in California,” the group wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

Little signed an executive order creating the Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force while he was attending the Western Governors’ Association’s Energy Superabundance conference at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. 
“The world is changing rapidly,” Little said Monday. “Energy demand is expected to increase by an unprecedented 30% in the near future. We cannot do that with our legacy energy. We are going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy.”
“States and nations are all searching for energy solutions,” Little added. “Advanced nuclear technology holds enormous promise to meet those needs. We are uniquely positioned here in Idaho with the lab. We are the home of the lab nation’s flagship nuclear research facility, and a global leader in innovation.”
 New task force will modernize Idaho’s LINE Commission, governor says

Little said the newly created nuclear energy task force replaces and modernizes the Leadership In Idaho Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE Commission, which his predecessor, former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, created. 
Little said the new task force will build off the LINE Commission’s legacy and piggyback on a series of nuclear energy executive orders President Donald Trump issued earlier this year. 
Given a spike in projected energy demand, Little said the United States is in a race with other countries to win the energy war – and the stakes are high.
“We are in a race with our enemies about what country is going to win this,” Little said.

The Energy Superabundance conference and Little’s executive order are coinciding with what Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner describes as a nuclear renaissance or resurgence in the United States. 
Idaho National Laboratory, which includes an 890-square mile research complex located in the desert outside of Idaho Falls, is considered the country’s lead nuclear energy national laboratory. While it operates four nuclear reactors today, Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of permitting and building new nuclear reactors for the first time in 50 years.  
Wagner told conference participants that a combination of massive growth in projected energy demand, fueled in part by AI data centers, support from the federal government and an infusion of money from private businesses are all contributing to the nuclear renaissance.
For example, shortly before Monday’s conference began, a company called Oklo held a groundbreaking ceremony outside Idaho Falls for its small modular reactor. Billionaire Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, served as chairman of Oklo’s board until April. 
“This is not new reactors coming in, being demonstrated 10 years from now,” Wagner said Monday, speaking generally about the overall nuclear renaissance. “This is multiple new reactors being demonstrated in the next few years.”

In addition to Little, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell also spoke and took questions at the Energy Superabundance conference. 
Cox attended the entire conference on Monday, and he and Wagner were available for interviews with news reporters. 
However, Little returned to Boise shortly after signing the executive order Monday afternoon and efforts to interview Little on Monday were unsuccessful. 
“We have to significantly increase the amount of energy that we are producing,” Cox said during the conference. “We have to move very, very, very quickly. We cannot move at the speed of government and at the speed with which we have been moving in the past. We really have to hyper scale.”
 What will Idaho’s new nuclear energy task force do?

The new task force will include Idaho elected officials, the director of Idaho National Laboratory or a designee, private sector representatives from the nuclear industry, college and university representatives, an official with an Idaho electric utility, officials from the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and more. 
According to the executive order Little signed, the new nuclear energy task force will advise him on topics including spent nuclear fuel, energy resilience and security, regulatory and legislative reforms and policy recommendations.
The new task force will also explore workforce development strategies and issue a report on its findings to the governor every year.
The Energy Superabundance conference is scheduled to continue Tuesday at Idaho National Laboratory with panel discussions on the supply chain, the lifecycle of nuclear fuel and workforce and construction capacity.

Transit officials late last month renewed their decade-old effort to require the borough to repay $5.8 million of the $12.3 million in grants spent between 2002 and 2008 to fund infrastructure for the defunct M/V Susitna ferry, including a ferry terminal at Port MacKenzie.
If they do not return the funds, the borough could face fines and the withholding of current federal grant payments, according to an Aug. 28 debt letter sent to borough officials from the Federal Transit Administration. The remaining $6.5 million was forgiven because the money was used for design work on the project, the debt notice states.
A borough appeal sent to transit officials on Wednesday on behalf of the Mat-Su Borough requests that the debt be further reduced to as little as $1.5 million, according to the letter.
The nearly $80 million Susitna ferry, which never operated or carried passengers, was given to the borough in 2010 through a series of federal earmarks.
Billed as the world’s first ice-breaking passenger catamaran and designed by the U.S. Navy, it was intended to transport passengers between Point MacKenzie and downtown Anchorage. But the project stalled in 2011 as funding to finish its infrastructure and the political will to select and build a dock site in Anchorage dried up.
The borough stored the ferry near Ketchikan and ultimately sold it to the Philippine Red Cross in 2015 for about $1.8 million. The Red Cross resold it to the Philippine Coast Guard earlier this year.
All told, the borough spent about $15 million in local funding on the project.
The new borough debt appeal asks transit officials to either settle the debt by accepting the net proceeds from the ferry’s sale – about $1.5 million – or reduce the bill to factor in the depreciated value of the Port MacKenzie ferry terminal, constructed with grant funds.
The debt should be lowered because the borough did not willfully misuse the funds, but instead was forced to abandon the project due to issues outside its control, including struggles to select an Anchorage landing location, the letter states.
“While MSB believes that all costs, other than the net proceeds from the sale of the ferry, should be permitted and forgiven since they were properly incurred during the term of the grants and not the result of willful misuse, it also seeks resolution of this matter,” the letter states. “As a result, (Mat-Su Borough) has proposed several options, some more appropriate and equitable than others, for FTA’s review and consideration.”
Proposed payback amounts included in the letter range from the $1.5 million ferry resale price to $3.7 million, depending on depreciation calculations and whether the repayment factors in about $295,000 worth of ferry outfitting and furnishing costs.
“At a minimum, (Mat-Su Borough) should be able to deduct eight and half years of depreciation, or 42.5%,” the letter states.
The letter is signed by Dismas N. Locaria, an attorney with the borough-contracted law firm Venable LLP, based in Washington, D.C. It was sent to transit officials following an approximately 35-minute closed-door session with the Mat-Su Assembly during a regular meeting Tuesday.
The Aug. 26 transit debt letter is the first communication from federal officials about the matter since the borough last filed an appeal in early 2017, Borough Attorney Nick Spiropoulos said in an email.
There is no set timeline for their next response, he said.

,DC,2025-09-22 23:15:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump ties autism to Tylenol use in pregnancy despite inconclusive scientific evidence,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-ties-autism-tylenol-use-pregnancy-despite-inconclusive-scientific-evidence,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Monday that his administration believes it’s found one contributing factor of autism and a possible treatment, though experts have said such claims are inconclusive and not backed by scientific evidence.Trump and officials from his administration said during a press conference the Food and Drug Administration will move to update the label on Tylenol, also called acetaminophen, to reflect their concerns that it could potentially be one of the environmental causes of autism. Numerous medical organizations and the manufacturer say there is no proven link.The FDA will also publish a notice in the Federal Register to change the label on leucovorin, a pharmaceutical intended to counteract the negative effects of certain cancer medications, so that doctors can prescribe it as a potential treatment for autism. “They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,” Trump said. “That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out. You can't do it. I guess there's that.”Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA “is responding to clinical and laboratory studies that suggest a potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including later diagnosis for ADHD and autism.”Kennedy noted, however, that the FDA recognizes that Tylenol “is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives have well documented adverse effects. “HHS wants, therefore, to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in the use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration and only when treatment is required.”Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with no medical or research training, said in April the department will shift its research into autism toward potential environmental causes, and pledged to have “some of the answers by September.”‘Not a single reputable study’Trump and Kennedy’s announcement was met with deep skepticism. Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, wrote in a statement released Monday that she's ""unsure why this announcement came today and how the conclusions were drawn.""“No new data or scientific studies were presented or shared. No new studies have been published in the literature. No new presentations on this topic were made at scientific or medical conferences,” Singer wrote. “Instead, President Trump talked about what he thinks and feels without offering scientific evidence. He said 'tough it out,' meaning don’t take tylenol or give it to your child. It took me straight back to when moms were blamed for autism. If you can’t take the pain or deal with a fever, then it’s your fault if your child has autism. That was shocking. Simply shocking.”American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement the Trump administration’s claim about Tylenol is “not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children.”“In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children,” Fleischman wrote. “In fact, the two highest-quality studies on this subject—one of which was published in JAMA last year—found no significant associations between use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.”ACOG writes on its website that women who experience headaches during pregnancy can use over-the-counter medications like Advil, also called ibuprofen, and Aleve, also known as naproxen, “for migraines that don’t get better with acetaminophen, but only in the second trimester and only for 48 hours or less at a time. It’s not clear if NSAIDs are safe for a fetus during the first trimester. Taking NSAIDs during the third trimester may lead to birth defects.""Oz wants state Medicaid programs to cover prescriptionsAt the press conference, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said leucovorin could possibly help alleviate low folate levels, which may be one potential factor in autism. ""Autism may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells,” Makary said. “We have a duty to let doctors and the public know we are going to change the label to make it available. Hundreds of thousands of kids, in my opinion, will benefit.”Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz said the agency will try to ensure anyone on a government health program can have a prescription for leucovorin covered. “Over half of American children are covered by Medicaid and CHIP,” Oz said. “Upon this label change, state Medicaid programs in partnership with CMS will cover prescription leucovorin around the country. It's yours, but you have to go to a doctor to get a prescription, because they know your child, they know you and they know the medication.”Oz said he believed that “private insurance companies will rapidly follow our lead if they have not already done so.”CMS, he said, is also contacting state governments to aid the Trump administration in studying the use of leucovorin as a possible treatment for autism. “Collecting real-world data, which is what many of you have been asking us to do in the community, is fast, it is life-saving and we'll get answers based on what happens over the next few months with this approach,” Oz said. NIH research projects pickedDirector of the National Institutes of Health Jay Bhattacharya said his agency has selected 13 projects to receive a share of $50 million to look for autism’s root causes and therapies. “The studies feature a new kind of science called exposomics, where scientists consider environmental and medical factors, nutrition, events during pregnancy in combination with biology and genetics to answer vital questions about autism,” Bhattacharya said.Bhattacharya also gave a brief description of autism spectrum disorder, noting it “encompasses a very wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild difficulties in social interactions to profoundly autistic children who experience severe disabilities in speech and behavior.“Given this wide range of symptoms across the spectrum, it seems certain that there will be a wide range of biological contributors to explaining the cause.”‘Findings are not entirely consistent’The Autism Science Foundation wrote in a statement released earlier this month that “low maternal folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in several studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though findings are not entirely consistent.”“Data suggesting that leucovorin may be effective come from four small randomized controlled trials, all using different doses and different outcomes, and in one case, reliant on a specific genetic variant,” the Autism Science Foundation notes. “This science is still in very early stages, and more studies are necessary before a definitive conclusion can be reached.”As for Tylenol, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine released a statement earlier this month that it “continues to advise physicians and patients that acetaminophen is an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.”“At this time, the weight of scientific evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes an increased risk for autism or ADHD is simply inconclusive,” SMFM President Sindhu K. Srinivas wrote in the statement. “In maternal-fetal medicine, as in all of medicine, our recommendations are based on an evaluation of rigorous research and data, clinical expertise, and our patients’ values and preferences.” The statement goes on to say that “untreated fever and pain during pregnancy carry significant maternal and infant health risks. Untreated fever, particularly in the first trimester, increases the risk of miscarriage, birth defects, and premature birth, and untreated pain can lead to maternal depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure.” Former Chief Medical Officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned from the agency earlier this year, said on a call with reporters before the announcement that she was concerned the conclusions will be premature and not based on solid science. “As of three weeks ago, we hadn't seen evidence that acetaminophen was linked with autism, so it's curious to know how quickly that was developed,” Houry said. Tylenol has information on its website rebutting the assertion that its product has been conclusively linked as a contributor to autism diagnoses. “Credible, independent scientific data continues to show no proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism,” its website states. The company adds that the best advice is for people to talk “to your healthcare professional before taking or administering acetaminophen.”",,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

The Arkansas Legislative Council’s Hospital, Medicaid and Developmental Disabilities Study subcommittee voted with no dissent to advance the contract to the council’s executive subcommittee. If approved by the executive subcommittee Thursday and the full council Friday, the contract goes into effect immediately.
A 2025 law requires the Hospital, Medicaid and Developmental Disabilities Study panel to propose draft legislation on potential changes to public assistance and workforce development programs by Oct. 1, 2026 in preparation for the 2027 legislative session.
The agreement with the Georgia Center for Opportunity (GCO) will expire Jan. 26, with the option for a six-month extension, according to the contract.

Exhibit F2- GCO Scope of Services and Fees 
The center will analyze information from several state agencies, including the Department of Education, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Commerce’s Division of Workforce Services.
Rachel Barkley, the initiative’s project manager and executive director of GCO’s Alliance for Opportunity, described the organization as “a multi-state coalition working on reforming social services and workforce services to help people rise from poverty into work.”
Some questions to ask in the review of Arkansas’ programs include how many offices exist for the same types of services and how administrative costs compare to the costs of the programs themselves, Barkley said.
GCO has done similar work with Louisiana, in which the organization recommended that the state allow people to sign up for Medicaid and food assistance in the same offices, Barkley said.
“This is really relevant to the One Big Beautiful Bill work requirements, that data being in the same place [is] important,” she said, referring to the federal budget reconciliation law that will institute cuts to Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in November.
The largest source of Medicaid savings will come from the law’s work requirements, which will reduce the number of insured low-income Americans, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects.
Arkansas implemented a Medicaid work requirement in 2018 that a federal judge struck down the following year after it caused 18,000 Arkansans to lose coverage. Earlier this year, the state requested a waiver to require adults in the Medicaid expansion program to work, volunteer, attend school or be caregivers in order to receive the full slate of benefits. The Path to Prosperity program would not include the reporting requirements that the 2018 policy did.
Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville (Arkansas Secretary of State)
Rep. Mary Bentley, a Perryville Republican and the subcommittee’s House chair, praised Arkansas’ SNAP and Medicaid work requirements and the proposed GCO study on Monday.
“We’re spending millions of dollars, but we have actually no idea what our return on investment is and why people are still not working,” Bentley said.
It costs Arkansas more than $2.2 billion annually to support the roughly 220,000 “able-bodied, working-age adults” in the Medicaid expansion program, an estimated 90,000 of whom are unemployed, according to the January letter to the federal government seeking a waiver to implement Path to Prosperity.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder said Monday the idea to amend a policy to require just three commission votes instead of four to request the governor suspend a commissioner would make […],"Montana Public Service Commission (via PSC Twitter account). The Montana Public Service Commission vice president wants to make it easier for the PSC to ask the governor to remove an elected commissioner.
PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder said Monday the idea to amend a policy to require just three commission votes instead of four to request the governor suspend a commissioner would make it easier for the commission to “gain control of actions at the agency.”
If adopted, another proposed policy change to remove a commissioner as a PSC officer also would require just three votes instead of four.
The PSC is made up of five commissioners elected by district and currently all Republican.
Montana law gives the governor the authority to suspend a commissioner if a complaint is made “and good cause shown.” The governor also may appoint a replacement during the suspension if he believes one is necessary.
The proposed policy changes come in the midst of a political fight with PSC President Brad Molnar that has spilled beyond the agency to the Governor’s Office and the court.
Molnar is under investigation at the PSC for allegations of unprofessional conduct.
He has acknowledged making politically insensitive statements but has characterized the investigation — and hiring of outside legal counsel and a communications and management firm by the agency — as a costly overreaction.
The dispute made its way to the Governor’s Office when Fielder, on behalf of an internal “response team” handling complaints against Molnar, asked the governor to suspend Molnar so the team could do its work without alleged interference or retaliation.
Molnar has denied interfering with the investigation but has said he used free speech rights to publicly defend himself.
The fight landed in Lewis and Clark County District Court when Molnar’s lawyer argued the complaint to Gov. Greg Gianforte failed to follow PSC policy.
On behalf of Molnar, lawyer Matthew Monforton requested the court bar the governor from suspending Molnar to protect the democratic process.
District Court Judge Mike Menahan granted a temporary prohibition on suspension because the request didn’t come with four “yes” votes by the commission as required by PSC policy.
The request came from the internal “response team,” and a separate proposed policy change would allow the team itself to request the governor suspend a commissioner if it finds the commissioner is interfering with its work.
But the judge also said Gianforte could take up a complaint he received that was “properly filed” under the PSC policy in the future.
Monday, Fielder said she did not have any intentions “right now” to refile a complaint with Gianforte if the PSC modified its policies.
However, she said she is focused on working through the current issues before the PSC and cooperating with the court process.
“I’m certainly not whipping votes of commissioners to take any specific actions,” Fielder said.
She also said she herself had not communicated with Gianforte about the matter.
She said she was not at liberty to discuss whether any members of the internal “response team” had communicated with the governor or a representative of his office.
However, Molnar said he believes the report into his alleged misconduct is complete — and that it may have been complete even as his opponents argued to a judge that it couldn’t be finished due to his interference.
“They asked for an injunction to be lifted because they can’t complete the report unless I am stymied,” Molnar said.
Last Tuesday, the parties argued in court over whether the judge should continue to maintain the prohibition on blocking the governor from suspending Molnar. A decision is pending.
Molnar said he learned last Wednesday the report was already finished, and he believes it might have been done one day earlier — when his opponents were arguing the judge needed to stop him from getting in the way of completing it.
“The report is done. They lied to the judge,” Molnar said.
In an email last Wednesday obtained by the Daily Montanan, Commissioner Randy Pinocci said he also was concerned the report was complete but the “response team” was stalling its release to commissioners.
“I’m thinking there’s a possibility this report is done or simply needs a few touchups and then will be released after President Molnar is forced to step aside temporarily,” Pinocci said. “If we are purposely sitting on this report waiting for President Molnar to step aside, I do not believe this is proper.”
Pinocci could not be reached by phone for additional comment. He was the only vote at a Sept. 3 meeting in support of Molnar’s unsuccessful bid to recall the complaint to the Governor’s Office.
Fielder said Monday she could not comment on whether the report was complete as it was part of the proceedings of the “response team.” However, she said the team still has work to do.
“We are attempting to complete the work that’s assigned, but the work is not finished yet because of so many attempts at disruptions,” Fielder said.
Molnar said he is concerned he may not see the report at all, and a policy change could mean he loses elected office despite the will of the voters in his district.
“Of course, the governor can relieve an appointed person,” Molnar said. “It’s a lot different when it’s an elected person.”
He said the action would effectively mean he’s fired.
“(But) you can’t fire an elected official. You can only suspend them without pay, and then they’re simply gone,” Molnar said.
The “response team” has commissioner members and staff members, and Molnar said he doesn’t believe staff should be able to ask the governor to suspend a commissioner.
He said he also doesn’t believe the governor should get to appoint a new commissioner with a 3-2 vote of the PSC.
Fielder said she would comment further on the proposed policy changes at a yet-to-be-scheduled public meeting.
In general, she said the PSC code of conduct has been effective in some cases, but not all.
“It’s also become time consuming and expensive to deal with this complaint — or series of complaints — with our current president,” Fielder said.
She said the bar for disciplining a commissioner is high and needs to be high, but she also said a majority of a quorum can make a decision on most major regulatory matters — or two out of the five commissioners.
“Some (policy) adjustments I think would be helpful to make the policy actually work more effectively for the agency and the public we serve,” Fielder said.
She said the proposed policy change would require at least 10 days of public notice before the PSC takes action.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

(Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)ATLANTA —  A key vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indefinitely postponed a controversial change to guidelines on administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborn babies, and altered long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed.
The panel also voted to reverse a decision they made only Thursday that would have prevented updated guidelines on the MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, from applying to children enrolled in the Vaccines for Children program.
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

Vaccines for Children is a federal program which covers the cost of vaccines for more than half of American children. The decision to implement different standards for children enrolled in VFC caused confusion among top health officials as well as some committee members when it was introduced Thursday.
Jason Goldman, the president of the American College of Physicians who also serves as a liaison to the committee, criticized Thursday’s vote, arguing that the changes were not backed by scientific evidence.
“Would you consider that the second vote actually revealed the truth, that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is no associated harm?” Goldman asked the committee.
The committee’s reversal on Friday standardizes the updated MMRV vaccine recommendations for all children. If ACIP’s recommendations are approved by CDC officials, doctors will be advised to administer separate MMR and varicella vaccines for all children under 4 years of age.
 ACIP tables a rule delaying Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns

In what appeared to be another reversal, the panel shelved a resolution that sought to alter current CDC recommendations around hepatitis B vaccines for newborn children.
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver, includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given a month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending a hepatitis B vaccine for all newborn babies since 1991, which resulted in a 99% drop in serious infections between 1990 and 2019.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

If ACIP members choose to implement the changes at a later meeting, official CDC guidelines will recommend that pediatricians delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease.
The panel did not provide any evidence indicating that delaying the vaccine improved children’s health, or that there were any widespread or serious instances of harm caused by administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns. However, some ACIP members also cast doubt on the accuracy of data showing the shot is safe.
“I think that there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants,” said Vicky Pebsworth, a committee member who is a registered nurse and who sits on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, which advocates for vaccine exemptions. “I think that the conclusion that we know that it is safe is, perhaps, premature.”
Dr. Adam Langer, who serves as the principal deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, urged the panel to reconsider narrowing the recommendations.
“One of the primary reasons for recommending universal birth dose in the U.S. is to serve as a safety net for infants born to mothers with unknown test results,” Langer said during his presentation to the committee on Thursday.
“To date, no country in the world has reverted from universal to selective birth dose recommendations,” he added.
The meeting, which was held at the CDC’s Chamblee campus, also inspired a demonstration organized by a group of former CDC workers, who dressed up as preventable diseases and waved signs to the passing cars while the meeting was underway.
Cindy Weinbaum, who retired from the CDC in 2021, said Friday that it was commendable that the committee skipped a vote that would have recommended babies not be vaccinated for hepatitis B within a day after being born, which is the current standard. (Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder)
Cindy Weinbaum, who spent about a decade of her career at the CDC in the division of viral hepatitis, said she commended the committee for deciding to table a vote that would have changed the recommendations for hepatitis B vaccinations.
“I think it’s really commendable, actually, that they delayed this vote because they do not know the implications of not recommending a birth dose of hepatitis B,” Weinbaum said.
“So that was a nod to their lack of understanding of vaccine programs, vaccine science and the importance of certain vaccinations for kids,” she added.
Weinbaum said the proposal’s appearance on the committee’s agenda reflects the “vaccine nihilism that the current administration is supporting.” She said the shot given to newborns within the first day of their life has found itself in the “cross hairs of the anti-vax movement.”
“It’s because here’s this newborn baby and you’re very vulnerable, and sticking it with a needle is kind of a scary thing,” she said. “They just don’t understand that it’s even more scary to get liver cancer, and that’s really what we want to prevent.”
 ACIP moves to center vaccine harm

Though the committee did not implement some of its more controversial proposals, ACIP’s new members have signaled that they would like to place a greater focus on examples of vaccine harm and adverse outcomes in future policy proposals.
They have also rejected widely embraced data on vaccine safety, choosing instead to focus on isolated cases and dubious studies, including one paper claiming that rats exposed to the COVID-19 vaccine exhibited “autism-like behaviors” that was eventually retracted by the journal that published it.
Some ACIP members, including Robert Malone, also pushed back against guidelines that advise vaccinating young children and pregnant women, arguing that there is a lack of data proving definitively that vaccines are safe.
“The default should be the assumption that there is no intervention in the infant and the pregnant woman with the vaccine unless there is definitive evidence of safety,” Malone said.
But Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College who has served as a past committee member, pushed back against the argument that any medical intervention should be entirely risk-free.
“I just want to point out that it’s very, very difficult to prove the absence of harm, it’s simply not a practical objective,” Meissner said.
“I think it’s important for everyone to understand that no vaccine is 100% safe and no vaccine is 100% effective,” he added. “What’s important for the provider before administering a vaccine is to think about that particular patient and does the benefit of protection exceed any possible side effect from the vaccine.”

But in a conversation with reporters after the meeting, Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, signaled that the committee could revisit other vaccine recommendations in future meetings.
“I think we need to review vaccines, in general, from time to time,” Levi said. “It’s part of a good process. I don’t think that I need now to single out one vaccine or another. I think that, in general, it’s actually in the mission of ACIP. . . to actually review every vaccine.”

The almost 30,000 Vermonters who get health insurance through Vermont Health Connect stand to lose a collective $65 million without an extension from Congress. On average, premiums are set to double.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘It couldn’t come at a worse time’: Vermont grapples with the potential end of Covid-era federal subsidies for marketplace he[...]","Almost 30,000 Vermonters are covered by health insurance purchased on the individual market of the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. Many can afford that coverage because of federal subsidies offered through the Affordable Care Act, which were then expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
But those enhanced subsidies are set to expire at the end of this year, and with it, those insured Vermonters stand to lose a collective $65 million if Congress does not extend those expanded tax credits soon.
“There would be the immediate and devastating impact on the families who rely on the Affordable Care Act, (and) there would be a ripple impact of higher rates with the cost shift on the rest of the insurance market,” Vermont Sen. Peter Welch said in an interview with VTDigger. “And it would come at a time when we in Vermont are absolutely overwhelmed with the price spikes in the cost of health care. It couldn’t come at a worse time.”
In Washington, Welch is sounding the alarm on the end of these credits: As he and his fellow Senate Democrats negotiate over a bill that would continue to fund the federal government past Sept. 30, the potential extension of the tax credits has taken a central role. Republicans need seven additional ‘yes’ votes to push the budget measure through and avert a government shutdown. Welch and his fellow Senate Democrats have positioned a permanent extension of expiring federal tax credits for health insurance as a central bargaining chip in these negotiations. Its passage could preserve access to health insurance for thousands of Vermonters. 
Understanding the Tax Credits
When the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it included tax credits to subsidize the costs for people who earn up to 400% of the federal poverty limit, when they purchased individual health insurance plans on the health care marketplace. In Vermont, that’s Vermont Health Connect, where Blue Cross Blue Shield and MVP sell plans. 
In 2021, as part of the American Rescue Plan, Congress expanded these tax credits. The so-called enhanced credits both increased the amount subsidized for people already eligible and also expanded the population of people eligible to those making more than 400% of the federal poverty line. Under that expansion, the purpose was to cap a household’s health care premium expense at 8.5% of its income. Both expansions of the tax credits were extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. 
Now, these enhanced tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025. 
More than 24 million people across the U.S. are enrolled in the marketplace, a participation that exploded from the 11.4 million participants in 2020 after the enhanced credits’ passage. Nearly all of those 24.3 million participants (92%) receive some amount of premium tax credit. 
Vermont is no exception to those trends: The broadened credits made marketplace insurance affordable for thousands more Vermonters, and led to a boom in enrollment in the plans. As of this January, 95% of Vermonters who buy their insurance on the marketplace receive federal premium tax credits, according to data from the Department of Vermont Health Access.
Consultants working for the department estimated that expanded subsidies equaled roughly $65 million in support for Vermont individuals and families, according to a 2024 report submitted to the Legislature. The amount that households in the state receive in enhanced subsidies is roughly one-fifth of the overall amount received through the federal Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. 
Open enrollment for 2026 health insurance plans begins on Nov. 1, which is when all of the purchasers who have been benefiting from the enhanced tax credits will face the prospect of higher out-of-pocket premiums next year for the same coverage they’ve been receiving. 
On average, that net premium for the entire subsidized population will more than double, said Adaline Strumolo, the department’s deputy commissioner overseeing Vermont Health Connect. 
Estimating the impact
Beyond an average, it’s hard to generalize the impact of the enhanced tax credits’ end, since each subsidy is individualized, based on household size and income. Households making less than 200% of the federal poverty level and those making more than 400% will see the biggest impact from the loss of the credits; they can expect to see the largest percentage of their income go toward their insurance.  
KFF, a nonprofit that provides health policy analysis and news, has created a calculator to help people determine how much they can expect their premiums to increase. VTDigger tried out some scenarios that illustrate what the loss might look like for Vermont families who buy insurance on the marketplace:
A single person in Windsor County who makes 150% the federal poverty limit ($23,475 annually) would go from paying nothing for a silver plan each month to $82 a month, or $984 per year. 
A family of four who earn $112,525 a year — 350% above the federal poverty limit — would go from paying $680 per month in premiums for all four members to get insurance on the marketplace, to $934 each month in premiums. That’s an increase of $3,048 for the year.
But the people who stand to lose the most support are those whose income is just above the line of 400% of the federal poverty limit — that is the population who will lose eligibility for the federal subsidies entirely, when the enhanced tax credits end. A single person making $63,000 a year (403% above the federal poverty line) would go from paying $446 a month for a silver plan’s premium on the marketplace to $1,277 a month; for a bronze plan, they would go from paying nothing each month to $808. For either plan, the expense totals almost an additional $10,000 annually.

For a family plan, the change becomes even more extreme: a household with two parents and two children earning 403% of the federal poverty limit would go from paying $918 a month to  $3,587 a month in premiums for the silver plan. That is an increase from $11,013 per year in cost to $43,045 a year. That $32,000 increase amounts to a shift from 8.5% of their income to 33.2%. 
There are about 6,000 Vermonters who make above 400% of the federal poverty limit and receive these enhanced ACA subsidies, according to Strumolo. This population can expect to see the most drastic loss of federal support in total dollars. 
“There is a practical reality that the price pressure is going to cause some people to go without coverage. That’s the thing we’re really concerned about,” she said. 
When people forgo health insurance entirely, it’s usually younger, healthier people, who make the financial gamble that being uninsured represents. When that happens, insurers generally raise premium prices for those remaining in the insurance pool — who are generally older or less healthy. In August, Vermont’s state regulator approved low premium increases for plans sold on the individual and small group marketplaces in the coming year, which included a price increase to account for the anticipated shift in behavior.
Strumolo stressed that while the end of the enhanced tax credits stands to be a massive loss for all those who benefit from it, the original subsidies will still exist for those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level — albeit in smaller amounts. She expects that the loss of the enhanced credits may also mean many people opt for a lower-tier plan.
“For the people who are still under 400%, there are a lot of options that are quite affordable at the bronze level, but even at the gold level,” she said. 
‘No state can cover the full gap’
The state also has its own version of its own tax credits called Vermont Premium Assistance, which is available to households making 300% of the poverty level or less. Right now, around 11,000 people rely on both subsidies, but many do not even need to dip into the state assistance, since the federal credits cover the entire cost of their plans. Strumolo says that she expects the end of the enhanced subsidies to mean that more people will need the state subsidy. As of January 2025, the state premium assistance totaled around $4.3 million of support annually. 
Still, it’s nowhere near enough: The state does not have the $65 million it would take to use Vermont Premium Assistance to fill the entire gap left by the enhanced federal tax credits, Strumolo said, citing her department’s 2024 legislative report. 
“That is not something we’re able to do on the state level. No state can cover the full gap,” Strumolo said. “That value is not one that a state budget can typically backfill.” 
If the federal credits do expire at the end of the year, she expects that her department will look for “creative solutions” in the state budget during the coming legislative session, to try to soften the drop-off for those right over 400% of the poverty line. Still, those changes would not likely come before people start to enroll in 2026 marketplace plans.

Yet Strumolo has not totally lost hope that the federal government could pull through with an extension of the subsidies. 
Senate Democrats are currently planning to withhold the votes needed to pass a bill to avert a shutdown of the federal government. A permanent extension of the enhanced tax credits is one of their primary requirements for their support. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders also said he is prepared to vote on a federal budget if Republicans agree to expand these tax credits as part of the resolution. “When you talk about raising the premiums for people on the Affordable Care Act very very high, which means that people simply aren’t going to be able to go to the doctor, that ain’t making America healthy,” he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.  
The continuing resolution that is currently funding the federal government ends at midnight on Sept. 30. 
Strumolo hopes that at least people will know whether they will be able to rely on the enhanced tax credits before open enrollment begins. But if not, and an extension of the enhanced subsidies occurs after enrollment opens on Nov. 1, “a lot of damage will be done,” she said. “People will see what they’re facing for 2026 and make coverage decisions” that they might then want to rethink if subsidies are extended. 
Yet, she said that in that scenario her department would “bend over backwards” to make sure people can get enrolled at that point.
What happens next? 
In Washington, Welch and Sanders both have repeatedly called their colleagues’ attention to the immense costs this will incur for all their constituents, as has Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. Welch believes that for a permanent extension of the enhanced premium tax credits to really get traction, President Donald Trump needs to weigh in.
“I’ve heard a number of my Republican colleagues say that they want to do it, but they won’t do it unless President Trump says, ‘Okay,’” Welch said, adding that for now Trump is insisting on no negotiations with Democrats. “We believe that extending premium support should absolutely be a bipartisan priority — everything that’s going to happen to Vermonters is going to happen to folks in West Virginia or Wyoming.” 
He worries about what it will mean in a state with an already extremely strained health care system. “We have this enormous pressure on the private insurance market in Vermont, where we’ve seen very, very high premium increases. We pay among the highest insurance rates anywhere,” he said. “What happens when the providers don’t get reimbursement from the government or from Medicaid, Medicare or the Affordable Care Act?”
On Capitol Hill, legislators are gearing up for a week where this question will be at the center of the negotiations surrounding whether Democrats will vote on a federal budget resolution. Welch hopes that back at home, Vermonters will not need to learn the answer the hard way.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley accused a state agency director of padding his work hours to “bilk the agency” of about $20,700 in what Foley called “unearned compensation.”
In his office’s latest probe, a 54-page report released Monday, Foley took aim at the part-time executive director of the Nebraska Abstractors Board of Examiners and its governor-appointed board. A key criticism: lax oversight.

“This guy reminds me of the legendary ‘Big Foot,’ as there are rumors of his existence but few verifiable on-the-job sightings,” Foley said of Trenton Behr, who was replaced by an interim director and could not be reached for comment. 
Established in 1965, the Abstractors Board exists to ensure competent real estate abstracting, the practice of creating understandable records of leases and deeds so buyers can be fully informed of a property’s legal status.
Funded by certification and exam fees, the agency, which is governed by a five-member board, employs one part-timer. 
Key findings
Among the audit’s findings:

 Alleged fraudulent payroll payments totaling $20,700 were made to the director, who auditors said was responsible for performing all payroll processing procedures. Foley said the amount could have been “worse” had there been no cap on eligible hours to work.
The director received two payments, totaling $1,128, for an unemployment insurance claim Foley said appeared to have been filed fraudulently because Behr still had another job.
Foley said the board is responsible for reporting budget information to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, and the auditing team said that was not completed properly for fiscal year 2025.

Foley said his team tried to talk to Behr who declined to do so through his attorney.
The board declined to comment to the Nebraska Examiner, but responded in the auditor’s report. At one point, the board reminded Foley’s team of a 2021 arrangement it made with the Department of Administrative Services for DAS to manage payment and oversight of the director’s pay.
“The DAS office should have been responsible for management of timekeeping and reporting of fraudulent hours submitted,” the board said, requesting that auditors remove or modify findings related to lack of internal controls to prevent one person from carrying out financial wrongdoings.  
The board agreed to take other actions in light of the auditor’s probe, including the review of itemized time cards submitted by the director to DAS. 
Foley’s team said that while a contract arrangement with DAS might mitigate some risk, it does not relieve the board of its oversight responsibilities. 
“A proper system of internal controls includes procedures to mitigate the risk for errors or abuse when a segregation of duties cannot be achieved,” the report said.
 Honor and responsibility

Foley, in an interview, reiterated the obligations of governing boards, even those that are volunteer. 
“There is just a common misunderstanding of what board service is all about,” he said. “It is an honor, but it is also a responsibility.”
Foley told the Examiner that his team’s findings do not convey anything negative or inappropriate about real estate-related practices.
“Nothing in our report reflects poorly on the core duties of the Abstractors Board to make sure real estate transactions are being properly handled,” he said. 
Foley said that while Behr was employed by the state, he also worked for another employer full-time and that the audit team collaborated with Albireo Energy in Omaha to examine Behr’s schedule between May 2024 and June 2025.
The audit team laid out documentation that disputed many hours Behr said he worked. In one 48-hour period examined, Behr claimed to have worked 24 hours straight for Albireo and another 10 hours for the board, Foley said. 
During a five-month stretch in 2025, timesheets filled out by Behr showed him working eight hours a day seven days a week for 140 consecutive days — “a remarkable display of fortitude and devotion to duty by a public servant,” Foley said sarcastically.
He also said Behr was a University of Nebraska at Omaha student earning a master’s degree during much of the time in question. The report documented a trip Behr made to Disneyland, while claiming hours worked for the board.
Auditors said they cooperated with the Nebraska State Patrol and the private employer looking into use of the Albireo corporate credit card. 
Foley said that Behr, after his job was terminated at the private employer, filed for benefits from the Nebraska Department of Labor, claiming a “not working” status despite his employment at the time with the board. Foley said the Labor Department paid Behr $1,128, and stopped after auditors  flagged the agency of the situation. 
Foley called the arrogance and “lack of civic consciousness” displayed by a “rogue” state employee  egregious.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montana)LOLO – Reaction time during a bear encounter is the focus of a new effort from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks to better educate the public about grizzlies and black bears.
And it involves a bear on wheels that can reach about the same top speed as a grizzly can — more than 30 mph. The bear is not life sized, but isn’t tiny and stands on what is essentially a four-wheeled souped-up radio controlled car. 
The training trailer and its educational content come from a partnership between FWP, Montana’s Outdoor Legacy Foundation (MOLF), with support from Safari Club International (SCI) Foundation, the Western Montana Chapter of SCI, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
The exercise involves inert bear spray, which a person can use when the bear is rushing at them. It’s an opportunity to find out how quickly you can get the spray up, get the safety off and squeeze the trigger.
Bear spray essentially acts as a barrier, and it’s important to discharge it correctly — forward and at a slightly downward angle, as a rushing bear’s nose and mouth will be low to the ground. 
Getting these types of tips out and giving people the opportunity to see how they would react is important, FWP bear technician Brandon Davis said at an event at Travelers’ Rest State Park in Lolo this weekend.
“A lot of people don’t know there’s bears around, that there’s grizzlies, and so we’re just trying to get people involved,” Davis said. “And just give them that muscle memory so their first time pulling out a bear spray isn’t on the trail.”
Bears have personalities, unique characteristics, can be a multitude of different colors and need personal space, Davis said. They are complicated, nuanced creatures and the education and outreach is in part to help the public understand more about them.

“Some (bear encounters) are really quick, and there’s not much you can do,” Davis said. “But there are times when you can look at the behavior and read that animal.”
Surprising a bear can often evoke a quick response from the bear, and it’s important to hold your ground — timid bears will often not attack someone who holds their ground. Bears also have faux charges.
For example, a female bear with offspring will aggressively defend her cubs. Running away from a bear can actually trigger a chase response from the bear.
Grizzlies and black bears also don’t act the same — black bears seem to rely on bluffing as opposed to a mauling. A grizzly encounter can be deadly, and recognizing these signs and doing what you can to not surprise any bear is important.
Autumn means bears are trying to consume as many calories as possible in a very short time, though rarely do bears attack humans in the name of eating them specifically.
Fear is one of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to bears, he added.
“These are big animals. They have the potential to kill you. But they’re not out to hurt you,” Davis said. “I mean, there’s always an outlier, that’s a generalization, but I think most of the time they just want to get away.”
During hunting season, Davis said, hunters need to be careful about  gut piles, especially this time of year. That’s one of the times people can accidentally bring bears into an area.
Davis said FWP recently set up a camera in an area near a hunter’s kill, and within 24 hours there were bears in the area. Hikers and backpackers should also be aware of carcasses on or near trails, which was the case in a bear encounter in Yellowstone National Park earlier this month.
In that case, a solo hiker surprised a bear near a carcass. The bear charged, the hiker discharged bear spray and suffered injuries that sent the man to the hospital, but were not life-threatening.

This year has, luckily, not seen many bad human-bear conflicts. Rebekah Ficek, an Americorps VISTA member with Travelers Rest Connection, is hoping the event helps keep it that way. She helped organize the event and used to do Americorps work with FWP. That’s where her interest in the creatures began, she said.
“I just really love working with bears, because I feel like they can be misunderstood,” Ficek said. “They’re just wildlife that can kind of get a bad rap sometimes.”
Ficek demonstrated proper usage of the bear spray and helped work with a number of people who cycled through the event. There was a steady flow of people throughout the day, which staff were happy about. 
She was also happy to push back against one  particular misconception.
“A lot of people think bear spray is actually bug spray,” Ficek said. “They try and spray it on themselves. We try so hard to reiterate, no, no, no, do not spray it on yourself. It is pepper spray, not bug spray. I’ve gotten that a lot.”
In addition to a variety of literature, the event also had taxidermy bears and lots of stories, along with plenty of stickers.
FWP staff also takes old and expired bear spray at any regional FWP office. A lot of bear spray also gets left at airports when tourists buy them and then can’t be taken back on a plane.
Throughout the month of September, which is Bear Aware month for the state, the agency is hosting more Bear Aware events across the state.
On Sept. 23 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., the agency is hosting a Bear Spray Program at the FWP Region 3 office in Bozeman. Another bear awareness event will be held at the Troy Apple Festival in downtown Troy on Sept. 26 from 2 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BearEvent1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-22 18:56:57.293204

The university has implemented several measures to protect staff, faculty and students, according to a news release. Operational details are unavailable for security reasons, but there’s an increased law enforcement presence on campus.
Lawmakers on the Utah Legislature’s School Security Task Force also spoke about the independent review during a Monday meeting, saying they expect those findings to provide valuable insights on how higher education institutions across the state can strengthen safety practices.

“Once the review and criminal investigation are complete, that will be the appropriate time for thoughtful conversations. Right now, we need to allow them to proceed without distractions,” Ogden Republican Sen. Ann Millner said while reading a prepared statement.
The Legislature’s responsibility is to ensure that the FBI, the state’s Department of Public Safety, the Board of Higher Education and Utah Valley University can carry out their reviews, Millner said. 
“We pursue real, evidence-based solutions, grounded in facts, not speculation or emotional reactions,” Millner added. “So let us stand together, firm in our values, respectful in our discourse, and unwavering in our pursuit of best practices and real solutions.”
Over 3,000 people attended the Turning Point USA event on Sep. 10 in an outdoor open venue where Kirk was shot by a lone gunman on a roof. Hours after the shooting, Utah Valley University Police Chief Jeff Long called the incident “a police chief’s nightmare.” Six police officers were at the event, along other officers in plain clothes in the crowd. Kirk’s security team was also present and collaborated with UVU’s public safety officials. 



Let us know what you think...


 


The university said it won’t discuss the specific security measures that were in place on Sep. 10 beyond what has already been shared until the review is complete. The goal is to ensure an impartial review and to support ongoing campus security, according to the release.
Campus closed down for students for a week after the shooting, and many returned feeling uneasy after the event, according to a FOX 13 report.   
Millner’s Monday statement also condemned the shooting, describing it as “a direct attack on the values that define our nation.”
“There’s no place for violence here in Utah on our college campuses or in this country, our universities must remain marketplaces of ideas, places where students, faculty and the broader community can engage in open, respectful and vigorous debate,” Millner said.

Bob Ferguson speaks at Renton High School on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, ahead of signing an executive order launching the Washington Completes FAFSA Campaign. (Photo courtesy of governor's office) Gov. Bob Ferguson has launched a campaign to increase the number of students who complete free applications for federal student aid to attend college and other education programs after high school. 
Nearly half of Washington households qualify for the financial aid, but Washington consistently ranks in the bottom five states for completion of applications, according to Ferguson’s office. 
Washington ranked 47th among states for Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, completion in 2025, with 45.3% of graduating seniors completing the application. 
“I want every eligible student to take advantage of this money for college, apprenticeships and other education or training,” Ferguson, who is a Democrat, said in a statement following the campaign’s launch at Renton High School on Friday. 
The Washington Completes FAFSA Campaign, created via executive order, establishes an advisory board to set a statewide FAFSA completion goal for each academic year, starting with the 2026-27 school year. 
The advisory board will include students, high school staff, a representative from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, higher education personnel, and nonprofit groups. 
The board will be staffed by the Washington Student Achievement Council. 
The council and advisory board will develop and execute a plan to help schools meet the year’s FAFSA completion goal, and help support schools in setting up their own goals to increase local FAFSA completion. 
The campaign will include free training and resources for schools and community partners. The Washington Student Achievement Council is also instructed to leverage its artificial intelligence-assisted chatbot, Otterbot, to provide support for students and families completing the FAFSA application. 
FAFSA completion data will be compiled to track progress or identify gaps for low-income students accessing financial aid. The advisory board will also submit an annual report detailing its progress and goals to the governor every year. 
“Completing a financial aid application is a critical step in unlocking opportunities for more than half of Washington’s students who might not otherwise be able to attend college,” said Isaac Kwakye, deputy executive director of Washington Student Achievement Council. 
The council’s research, Kwakye said, shows that students from the lowest-income families who receive financial aid typically surpass their parents’ income within three years of graduation from college. 
By completing the FAFSA, students and families can take advantage of federal grants, scholarships and loans, as well as Washington state financial aid opportunities. 
Only nine of the 228 school districts in Washington that submitted FAFSA completion data for the 2024-25 cycle recorded an application completion rate of 80% or higher. 
“Washington is one of the most, if not the most, generous in terms of financial assistance,” Ferguson said. “To access that money, all you have to do is fill out the form. You will never know how much financial aid you qualify for unless you do.”
While the Washington Completes FAFSA Campaign only sets goals related to FAFSA completion, students who are not eligible for federal aid but may be eligible for state aid have the option of completing the Washington Application for State Financial Aid instead.
The WASFA is an application for the Washington College Grant, which covers full tuition and fees at any of the state’s public universities for students who are below 60% of the median family income. Some money is also available through the grant for those with higher incomes, and there is also some money available for private colleges and universities.
Anyone in Washington can choose to use the WASFA instead of the FAFSA, although they won’t get federal aid if they choose that route. 
The FAFSA for aid that will go into effect for the 2026-27 school year will open by Oct. 1. The WASFA will open sometime in October. 
Superintendent Chris Reykdal, in a written statement, called the new FAFSA campaign “an important effort to boost awareness for students that may be eligible for federal, state, or institutional aid.” But he also said the state would need to “move past the existing high tuition, high aid model if we are going to expand the state’s economic prowess.” 
He said that a state commitment to tuition-free degrees, as well as zero-tuition opportunities like dual credit high school programs, will be necessary to increase college enrollment rates.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed.jpg,,,2025-09-22 18:56:57.293204

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota state Rep. Peri Pourier has switched her political affiliation from Democratic to Republican.
Pourier made the announcement on Monday, a day before lawmakers gather for a special session to vote on a state prison construction plan. South Dakota Searchlight confirmed Pourier’s registration switch with a county election official.
The switch further tips the scales in Republicans’ favor, with 97 Republicans and eight Democrats in the Legislature after Pourier’s defection. That’s the lowest number of Democrats in the Legislature since 1953, when there were two.
Pourier is an Oglala Lakota tribal member with a Rapid City address who represents District 27. It stretches from just east of Rapid City to the Pine Ridge Reservation and includes other rural areas. She is a former member of the Democratic House leadership team, but declined to caucus with her fellow Democrats during the most recent legislative session. So did her Senate district mate Red Dawn Foster, who did not immediately respond to a South Dakota Searchlight message Monday.
Special session could resolve or inflame years of debate about SD’s pre-statehood penitentiary

Pourier was minority whip in the House Democratic caucus in 2023 and 2024. She sat on the House Judiciary, Military and Veterans Affairs, and Taxation committees last legislative session. 
In a Facebook post, Pourier said tribal sovereignty aligns with the Republican Party tenets of decentralized government, economic prosperity, lower energy costs, self-determination and public safety. “By contrast,” she added, “well-intentioned Democratic reforms have too often undermined sovereignty.”
“My decision reflects a strategic recalibration — one that strengthens my ability to advocate for our communities and deliver meaningful results,” Pourier said. “I will not explain away poverty and violence with rhetoric. I remain committed to confronting these issues directly — not someday, not when it becomes politically convenient, but now.”
House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, said Pourier has been invited to the House Republican caucus meeting on Tuesday morning during the special session.
“We will benefit from her strong voice and unique perspective on issues, and her constituents will benefit from more exposure to Republican principles,” Odenbach said in a text message. “It should be a win-win for everybody involved.”
Pourier’s Facebook post did not say whether she will participate in Republican caucus meetings or abstain from caucusing as she did during the last legislative session.
House Minority Leader Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, said she believes Pourier will continue to “act on her values and principles,” and hopes she will continue to represent the best interests of her constituents in southwestern South Dakota and on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
Healy added that Pourier was the only Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Healy plans to discuss changing committee member assignments to ensure Democrats have a seat on the committee next session.

South Dakota Democratic Party Executive Director Dan Ahlers said he’s “disappointed” by Pourier’s announcement. He said South Dakota Democrats have addressed Native American issues more successfully than Republicans on the state and national level.
Ahlers added that party affiliation switches among lawmakers “usually happen because of something other than a change in their values.” Sometimes lawmakers switch parties because it’s advantageous for the next election or to gain access to a task force or committee, he said.
Former Sen. Ryan Maher was the last Democratic lawmaker who switched to the Republican Party. He switched in 2011 after serving as a Democrat from 2007 to 2010, while representing a portion of northwestern South Dakota and the Cheyenne River Reservation.
Other examples of lawmaker affiliation switches include former Sen. Jim Bradford, who switched from Democratic to Republican in 2009 and then back to Democratic in 2011, and former Sen. Jenna Netherton, who switched her affiliation from independent to Republican in 2013.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EM8A1122e-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-22 18:56:57.293204

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Harvest season is underway for many Iowa farmers, as more than 65% of corn acres have reached maturity, according to the latest crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
As farmers log long days in the combines, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig urged farmers to keep physical and mental health “top of mind.” 
In a news release recognizing National Farm Safety and Health Week, Naig said farmers should follow safe equipment operation practices, wear proper protective gear, inspect and maintain machinery and stay safe around grain bins.

Naig also reminded drivers that during harvest season, slow-moving farm equipment will be a common sight on the road. He urged drivers to stay alert, avoid distractions like cell phones and to keep a safe distance on the road.

“It’s also important to acknowledge that the long, stressful workdays and economic challenges facing agriculture can take a toll,” Naig said in the release. “I encourage farmers and ag workers to be mindful of their mental health and well-being, and to watch out for their neighbors too. No one needs to feel alone. There are resources readily available for Iowans.”
The release said engaging in hobbies, prioritizing sleep and talking to family, friends and mental health professionals can help farmers prioritize their mental health during the stressful season.
Iowa State University Extension and Outreach offers farm stress resources that can help farmers and their families. Additionally, farmers can access several hotlines for mental health support, or if they are dealing with suicidal thoughts. 
Hot, wet conditions for the start of harvest season
Wet conditions last week left farmers with an average of about five days suitable for field work. Despite the low number of days in the field, 8% of Iowa corn acres harvested for grain have been harvested, which is ahead of both last year and the five year average for corn harvest. 
Corn rated 74% good to excellent for the Sept. 15-21 reporting period. Soybeans also rated 74% good to excellent for the period. 
The report noted soybean harvest has begun on some farms in the state, but not enough has been harvested to appear on the report. Sixty-two percent of soybean acres were dropping leaves across the state and nearly 90% of the crop has colored in Iowa. 
Soil moisture conditions improved slightly during the reporting period compared to the week prior. According to the report, 70% of topsoil and 72% of subsoil moisture conditions were adequate for the reporting period. Less than 20% of topsoil and subsoil conditions were short of moisture for the period. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, Iowa had an average of nine-tenths of an inch of precipitation, which was one tenth of an inch above the climatological normal – though some central and southeastern regions had around three inches during the reporting period. 
Glisan also reported that temperatures across the state were 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. The average temperature for the week was 71.6 degrees.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)LEFT HAND, W. Va. — The residents of Roane County, West Virginia, enjoy living among the rolling mountains and winding, two-lane roads. Situated between Charleston and Parkersburg, two of the state’s largest cities, the rural county is known for its small towns and historic buildings.
That’s how Sherry Husted, the director of the Roane County Public Libraries, described her native community as she worked last week at Geary Public Library in Left Hand, West Virginia. Each of the county’s three library branches has at least three public computers and free internet access, among other services.
These services are essential to residents living in Roane — where less than 32% of the county’s households, businesses and community buildings — have reliable internet connectivity, according to the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map.
“We love our rural area,” Husted said. “But there’s always the catch. You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.”
Members of the library staff regularly help patrons fill out job applications and build resumes. They also help those who have never used a desktop computer before — many of the county’s residents rely on their cellular devices and spotty mobile service, Husted said. Most residents still use landline phones, she added.
And those with internet access at home are paying a steep price. Husted’s plan with Frontier, which includes fiber internet and a landline, comes to $170 a month.
“If you work from home, you need reliable internet,” she said. “Frontier does the best they can. But this is a very rural area, so the trees and terrain are constantly messing up the internet. And because of the demand on these older lines, your internet may not be reliable enough to host things like meetings or classes.”
Roane County is one of the areas federal officials hoped to support through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access. The $42.45 billion initiative, created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aimed to close the digital divide — with a focus on rural communities.
The Trump administration’s changes to the program, however, have disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations — including homes, businesses and community buildings — from receiving internet access. And the program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the federal funds toward satellite internet companies, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, that cost less to build but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable.  That means households and businesses that were looking forward to reliable, high-speed internet will no longer get support from the BEAD program.
While some experts were initially skeptical about the program’s goals, every state utilized its allocated funds to develop plans to provide high-speed fiber internet to nearly every home and business in the country, said Christopher Mitchell, the director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-corporate advocacy group.
Most states are expected to get started on deployment projects in 2026. But the Trump administration’s changes have undermined the major investment for rural areas, Mitchell said.
“I think everyone should care about it — even though most people don’t live in rural America — because when we electrified the entire country, the entire economy grew,” Mitchell said. “We will all benefit from this when everyone has more options to share their knowledge, their gifts and their productivity in the economy.”
Even West Virginia, ranking last in internet connectivity, would have effectively achieved universal broadband under the state’s original proposal, according to an unreleased draft of the state’s plan obtained by The Benton Institute for Broadband and Society, a policy group. West Virginia has about 78% connectivity, the only state with less than 80%.
But under West Virginia’s updated final proposal, submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration earlier this month, tens of thousands of households and businesses will no longer have access to BEAD funding.
West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he is still optimistic about the rollout, telling reporters recently that some of the decrease in coverage was because of inaccurate information. Some areas had just a few homes, or addresses only had a barn on the property, he and an aide said.
“We’ve been trying to target all the available locations that are eligible,” the governor said Sept. 18 at a news conference at the West Virginia State Capitol. “It’s a pretty fulsome application, and so obviously there were some changes made to accommodate some of the responses from the administration. And in a positive way, they’re trying to save money.”
There are other changes: Internet providers  will no longer be required to provide a low-cost service option to residents to address affordability concerns. And under the “technology-neutral” approach, some locations will no longer be receiving fiber internet, which the federal government previously emphasized due to its speed and durability.












You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.


– Sherry Husted, director of the Roane County Public Libraries




The new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
West Virginia isn’t alone. Under the new rules, thousands of households, businesses and community buildings across the country will be disqualified from the federal government’s push to provide internet access to the areas that need itmost. And those locations that are still eligible for funding may not receive the best service available — or be able to afford it.
West Virginia has one of the country’s worst workforce participation rates. Internet access is key to changing that, said Bill Bissett, chairman of the West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council.
“We are hopeful that this new proposal will be supported because we need to get started on this development as soon as possible,” Bissett said. “Because the longer we wait, the less people will be connected because of increased costs in deployment and infrastructure.”

Following the required revisions, West Virginia fared well compared with other states, said Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. But Garner said he expects frustration in other states.
“West Virginia, because it did a good job with its restructuring, is still going to have a lot of strong outcomes,” Garner said. “But across the country in some of these other states, I think there’s going to be a lot of frustration with these changes and the way it walked back from what was going to be a very promising outcome.”
 BEAD restructuring

In June, the Trump administration revised the rules of the BEAD program in what the U.S. Department of Commerce said was an effort to lessen regulatory burdens, reduce costs and streamline the process.
As of Sept. 18, 41 states had submitted their updated final proposals, according to a database from Connected Nation, a nonprofit that advocates for expanded broadband access.
In December 2022, when the FCC released its updated National Broadband Map, nearly 12 million locations across the country were in need of internet service. Over the years, that number has decreased because of private investments, continued deployment by existing internet providers and additional support from other federal programs.
States originally identified 4.86 million locations that would be eligible for getting internet connectivity through BEAD funds. But that number is projected to fall to 4.19 million locations following revisions initiated by the Trump administration, according to an analysis from Broadband Expanded, a project from the New York Law School.
West Virginia was originally slated to deploy broadband to approximately 110,000 locations. Now, 73,560 of those locations will receive BEAD funding, according to the state’s new proposal. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nebraska and Rhode Island could see more than half of the locations in their state disqualified from the program.
But some of those locations may still be in need of internet, said Garner, of the Benton Institute.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, directed states to remove certain locations from the BEAD program because they’d acquired internet access from another source.
But, in an effort to save taxpayer money, states also had the option to say they were “financially incapable” of serving a location.
“One of the changes the administration made to the BEAD program is that states and the NTIA now have a way to simply say that these locations are just too expensive,” Garner said. “They can say, ‘It is just going to cost too much, so now we’re going to say they’re ineligible.’”

The BEAD program’s new technology-neutral approach poses another challenge. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations. But some argue that other technologies would be cheaper.
This change has opened the door for satellite internet providers, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, to receive money from the program. Starlink could be awarded approximately $10 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In West Virginia, Starlink will serve more than 4,100 locations, according to the governor’s office.
“Based on the technology and based on all the evidence we have, some of these technologies — unlicensed fixed wireless especially — are not really a reliable internet service that’s going to meet the needs of a 21st century household,” Garner said.
 Rural advocates speak up

In Nebraska, more than half of the counties in the state have signed onto letters to federal officials objecting to the changes, including the disqualification of nearly half the state’s eligible locations.
“It’s very frustrating. We have all these holes in our county, and BEAD was going to bring service to those areas,” Milford County Commissioner Misty Ahmic told the Nebraska Examiner.
Critics in Pennsylvania have said directing funds toward satellite companies is “shortsighted.” Satellite companies Starlink and Project Kuiper, an Amazon subsidiary, were awarded a combined $19.2 million to expand internet access in Pennsylvania.
And in Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated BEAD funds.
The state’s head broadband official said the new proposal would still serve everyone, but critics told the Oklahoma Voice that it would be wrong to send back any federal money while people across the state continue to struggle with internet access.
Originally, states were allowed to use these leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment, such as West Virginia’s plans to improve cellular service and streamline the permitting process for broadband projects. But the federal telecommunications agency has not released guidance on how the leftover funds are to be used under the restructured program.
“There’s a lot of fear right now that NTIA may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Garner said. “That leftover money is the state’s, according to the law. And these ancillary funds would play a huge role to support the BEAD program.”
Affordability also will be a barrier for some households. States are no longer required to provide a low-cost service option for low-income households under the changes. And the federal Affordable Connectivity Program ended last year without additional funding from Congress.
Morrisey said his administration is being aggressive, collaborating with the Trump administration to get internet access to eligible areas.
“I applaud the Trump administration for working with us, but once again, I am not going to do a victory lap until we actually get this all done,” the governor said.
Providing internet to every person in West Virginia was always a lofty goal, said Husted, the Roane County Public Library director.  Other initiatives have promised to connect rural residents over the years, Husted said, and she remains skeptical about this outcome.
“In rural areas, you’re going to need to plan for things, and sometimes that puts us at a disadvantage compared to the cities,” Husted said. “With the internet or with other supplies, sometimes we have to decide what is more important to us.”

Michael Bennet on Monday announced his platform to improve housing affordability in Colorado if he is elected governor in 2026. His plan includes a 30% increase in state-supported housing projects. 
Bennet, a Democrat, wants to support first-time home buyers, preserve existing affordable housing units, streamline state housing resources and processes, reduce construction costs and reduce homelessness. He said those efforts combined with more private investment can lead to a 30% increase in the housing stock  
“I believe Colorado can be a place where families don’t have to spend more than 30% of their income on housing,” Bennet said. “A place with starter homes for young people, family homes for parents raising kids, and affordable options for seniors.

More creative state investments and partnerships can yield additional housing, Bennet said, adding that projects should move fast and involve collaboration with local and state government and other stakeholders.
“I think that this is the No. 1 priority in Colorado, and we obviously are going to be facing a challenging budget environment, there’s no doubt that’s true, but if I’m elected governor, this housing project will be at the top of my list as a priority to fund,” Bennet said. 
Bennet announced his housing priorities Monday at a construction site on the Auraria Campus in Denver where Metropolitan State University is developing housing for students and workers on state-owned land. 
“If we keep on the path that we’re on today, our families will be priced out of this state,” Bennet said. “Our companies will be priced out of the state. Our kids will be priced out of the state, and that’s why I think this has to be our No. 1 priority.” 










If we keep on the path that we’re on today, our families will be priced out of this state.


– U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, Colorado governor candidate


Most of the state’s housing funds come from Proposition 123, a measure Colorado voters approved in 2022 that dedicates an additional $300 million annually to the state’s affordable housing efforts. It protects the additional revenue by exempting the funds from the annual limits set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, the 1992 state constitutional amendment that places restrictions on Colorado’s tax and spending levels.
The Colorado Legislature in recent years has passed several laws reforming land use policies in the state to encourage additional housing construction. That includes laws to streamline modular and manufactured housing, expand the parts of the state where accessory dwelling units are universally allowed, incentivize denser housing around transit hubs, and reduce litigation risks for construction defect claims. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has made “More Housing Now” a key goal throughout his second term as governor.  
Demographers estimate Colorado needs about 100,000 more units to meet the housing demand in the state. 
Bennet is running against Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser in the Democratic primary in June to be Colorado’s next governor. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will likely be favored to win the general election. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election.

Michelle Lujan Grisham and Jon Goldstein, the associate vice president of the Energy Transition at the Environmental Defense Fund at a Sept. 22, 2025 press conference. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM) New Mexico’s stricter methane rules for oil and gas companies mean the state’s emissions are half of releases from neighboring Texas, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced in a news conference Monday, alongside environmental advocates.
“We know that methane is what creates global warming, faster than any of our other carbon issues on the planet. So if you’re gonna make an impact, this is where you must make it,” Lujan Grisham said.
Satellite data showed 1.2% of natural gas escaping into the atmosphere relative to the total amount produced and sold in New Mexico — a measure called methane intensity— compared to 3.1% in Texas.
The results are “striking,” Environmental Defense Fund Energy Transition Associate Vice President Jon Goldstein said during the news conference.
“It’s the clearest evidence yet that regulations are working,” he noted. “The state’s efforts to put sensible requirements in place to limit methane emissions from oil and gas development are having a marked impact on pollution on the state.” 
Methane is a colorless, odorless gas and a significant driver of climate change as it is 28 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. New Mexico passed rules in 2021 and 2022 to require producers to track and capture 98% of the gases. The EPA issued additional rules under the Biden Administration, which President Donald Trump has vowed to roll back, prompting pushback from states, including New Mexico. 
Lujan Grisham said she hopes the state can be a leader on the issue, as the federal government moves to implement more regulations cuts for industry. 
“I don’t have a good ready statement except that I believe New Mexico won’t be one of those places that can be strong-armed to do the wrong thing for the people that we serve,” she said. 
But the findings — which include data collected by nine satellites and validated by the Environmental Defense Fund — still show that New Mexico is projected to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than its 2030 goals set forth in an executive order issued by Lujan Grisham in 2019. 
Efforts to enshrine those goals into law in recent sessions have failed, and the Lujan Grisham administration is running out of time to pass them, given the 2026 30-day session will be the last of her second term.
The Environmental Defense Fund noted that New Mexico’s methane emission rate is still “appreciably high,” and that additional efforts would need to be in place to reduce emissions. Oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled since 2020. 
Lujan Grisham acknowledged that “we are seeing a drastic reduction in our greenhouse gases methane, but it’s not where we have to be by 2030.” 
\New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney said the state would work with EDF to close the 9% gap and meet the 2030 emissions reduction goal. 
“This partnership, this ability to work together, to develop the science, to work with regulators, to then implement what we’re learning  will show that there is not a lack of leadership around climate in the United States – it’s actually happening within the states,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MLG-Presser-Sept.-22-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 17:57:09.317385

Ambetter from Home State Health, a subsidiary of Clayton-based Centene Corporation, is mailing checks totaling more than $1 billion to customers in Missouri because it violated the Medical Loss Ratio requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Letters dated Sept. 10 notifying policyholders of the rebates — equal to more than one month’s premium for each — began arriving in mailboxes over the weekend. 
One of Ambetter’s competitors, United Healthcare, is also making rebates to Missouri customers. In a Sept. 5 news release, United Healthcare stated that it will rebate $192.2 million nationally for group market plans offered in 31 states and $167.1 million for individual insurance market plans offered in 19 states. 
Missourians in both United Healthcare markets will be eligible for rebates but the material supplied by the company did not show the amounts.
The rebates from Ambetter are also more than all rebates from all companies operating in the Missouri marketplace since the Affordable Care Act began requiring them in 2012. Over 12 years, insurers have rebated $587.1 million to Missouri policyholders, with the most being $192.7 million in 2019.
Centene did not respond to questions sent by email about the rebates.
Every year insurers must report their revenue from premiums and spending on health care and activities intended to improve care, such as smoking cessation or other programs. That is compared to the amount spent on administration.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services evaluates the reports and determines the rebate amounts. The data is examined on a three-year rolling basis and Ambetter’s rebates are for the years 2022-2024.
During 2023, CMS directed companies to rebate $957 million nationally. A report summarizing rebates for 2024 is not yet available.
Each insurer must spend 80% of total premiums — and 85% of money from premium increases — on health care.
During that period, of premiums paid for individual policies, Ambetter told policyholders in the letter that it spent only 71.4% of the approximately $12 billion received in premiums. Ambetter must refund the 8.6% difference, with checks going out that total $1.01 billion.
Ambetter is the largest individual insurance provider in the state, according to data from KFF, a health policy news and analysis organization. Ambetter covers about 46% of the 270,275 people buying individual plans. Elevance, formerly Anthem, is the second largest, with 28% of the market, followed by United Healthcare, with about 7%.
Along with the rebate checks, customers buying plans from Ambetter will likely see some of the smallest premium increases in the state in the coming year. According to an Aug. 1 news release from the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance, Ambetter is seeking an average premium increase of 1.9% starting Jan. 1.
Seven of the eight other companies offering plans in all or part of the state are proposing increases averaging from 4.6% to 29.2%. One, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, has said it will cut rates by an average of 4.2%.
“Missourians should expect to see premium increases for many of the individual market plans as well as changes to coverage areas and networks,” the department said in the news release.
The final premium rates for all companies will be announced by Oct. 31.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A quartet of performing arts groups has won a legal faceoff with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) after a federal judge in Providence found the agency flouted free speech rights.
In his Sept. 19 ruling, Senior U.S. District Judge William E. Smith in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island agreed with most, but not all, legal arguments brought by four arts organizations filing suit against the feds in March over imposing grant funding conditions based on artwork content. 
Smith vacated an NEA “Final Notice” on grant policy as it “promises to penalize artists based on their speech,” especially if those applicants feature LGBTQ+ content in their projects.
Marta V. Martínez, executive director of Rhode Island Latino Arts, the lead plaintiff organization and the only one based in Rhode Island, cheered the ruling in a statement: “This decision affirms what we have always believed: the freedom to create, to express one’s truth, and to tell our stories is a right protected by the First Amendment.”
The other three plaintiffs are National Queer Theater, Boston’s The Theater Offensive, and Theatre Communications Group, a New York-based member organization which counts more than 500 theaters among its members.
Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, found that the federal agency violated the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in its application of Executive Order 14168, which was signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. Among the order’s provisions are a ban on using federal money to “promote gender ideology.” 
That “ideology” is one which avoids a gender binary and “[replaces] the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts,” according to the order. 
Smith set aside the NEA Final Notice, which stops the agency from discriminating or disfavoring applications for projects which could fall under the administration’s label — a concern for plaintiffs, who regularly produce content showcasing LGBTQ+ narratives or lives, which are often at odds with the order’s notion that “sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.”
Smith ruled that the NEA is barred from requiring plaintiffs to comply with the executive order if they receive grants. The plaintiffs can request broader relief within 14 days. The feds have seven days to respond after that, with the plaintiffs given another seven days to follow-up on the feds’ response.
In February, the NEA added new language to applications for its most popular variety of competitive subsidy, Grants for Arts Projects, which funds works across media including the performing arts. The NEA added a compliance checkbox to applications and asked applicants to certify that any grant funding they received would not be used for projects involving so-called “gender ideology.”










This decision affirms what we have always believed: the freedom to create, to express one’s truth, and to tell our stories is a right protected by the First Amendment.


–  Marta V. Martínez, executive director of Rhode Island Latino Arts, lead plaintiff organization


The NEA’s maneuver kicked off a legal challenge in Rhode Island’s federal district court, with lawyers from the national and local ACLU banding together to represent the four arts organizations. 
NEA funding has helped subsidize productions like those by plaintiff The Theater Offensive, which bills itself as making “liberating art by, for, and about queer and trans people of color that transcends artistic boundaries, celebrates cultural abundance, and dismantles oppression.” 
Such art could be denied grants under the NEA’s modified policy, so the artist groups worried they would either need to forego funding or change their plans for productions — which are often shaped months in advance — to match the new policy. Plaintiffs also worried about potential legal repercussions if they certified compliance while still producing LGBTQ+ content. 
The legal challenge prodded NEA to remove the compliance checkbox, but the agency also argued it hadn’t instituted any final rules yet. 
Smith’s latest judgment follows his April 4 decision in which he denied the plaintiffs preliminary relief and allowed the NEA to carry out its administrative process. The case, originally filed in March, sought to stop the NEA from instituting the guidelines ahead of an April grant application deadline. The moment was premature, Smith wrote in April, and the court could not disallow the NEA from taking an action it had not yet taken.
“Because that process has since concluded, this consideration no longer applies,” Smith wrote in his latest ruling. “And the public interest is not on the government’s side when it uses a program designed to promote free expression to squash it instead.”
The court did deny the plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment-based claim that the applications’ language was “unconstitutionally vague.” 
Smith said the NEA might engage in arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement by having the chairperson exercise final control of Trump’s mandate. That might indeed contradict free speech or administrative procedure laws, Smith wrote, but the government’s admission of the chair’s intent isn’t vague, but specific.

Do NEA grantees produce government speech?
After Smith’s last ruling, on April 30 the NEA finalized its new policy and redirected the power to adhere to Trump’s order to its chairperson. 
A July 16 cross motion signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Bolan outlines the feds’ case and describes how the agency implemented the order, and that “the NEA rejected a categorical application,” Bolan wrote.    
“Only the Chair would consider whether a given project might ‘promote…gender ideology,’” Bolan wrote. He cited earlier NEA court documents which claimed, “If the NEA Chair concludes that a proposed project ‘promotes gender ideology,’ that factor could weigh against the project’s final approval.”
Projects would be reviewed on a “case-by-case” basis by the chair, the motion states, and the chair would not be reviewing applications until October. Furthermore, the government can consider value judgments and exercise discretion in providing competitive subsidies like NEA grants, Bolan wrote.
Underlining the federal rationale in court is that the NEA’s grantees produce government speech — a category not shielded by the First Amendment. 
“First, no one could mistake the NEA’s funding decisions as private speech,” Bolan’s motion stated. “The very existence of the NEA as a federally funded grant-making body that implements a structured competitive process shows that only the government is speaking.”
Yes, Smith agreed broadly in his ruling: “There is no question that, historically, art has been used as a medium to communicate the government’s messages and that often the government has relied on the work of private artists to achieve that goal.”
The judge continued, “But the Court is wary of painting with too broad a brush.”
That’s because NEA has always functioned as “a vehicle for private expression” since its inception in 1965, Smith wrote, and was not intended as “an instrument of political communication.”
Amendments made to the agency’s statute in 1990 followed a controversial season in which two NEA-funded exhibitions — one which included “Piss Christ” by Andres Serrano, and the other a retrospective of works by gay male photographer Robert Mapplethorpe — led Congress to add an obscenity clause to the NEA statute.
The feds argued that this revision of law only reinforced the idea that the public knows the NEA is government speech. 
“[E]nough of the public knew what NEA funding meant to motivate Congress in 1990 to amend the Act based on only two photography exhibitions,” the July motion reads.
But that obscenity clause received a different treatment from Smith, who wrote that it only furthers the idea that “Congress intended to preserve the NEA as a vehicle for private speech, despite the potential for public controversy.”
“[T]he Court finds it unlikely that members of the public would think that NEA-funded artists speak for anyone but themselves, and certainly not for the government,” Smith wrote. “That is especially true given the diversity of views reflected in the projects that the NEA — even when accounting for changes in presidential administrations — has decided to fund.”
“In short, the government may speak for itself when it approves an artist’s work, but that does not mean the artist speaks for the government when it produces that work,” Smith wrote.
The NEA did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Vicki Lopez and Toby Overdorf answer questions following a property tax meeting. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)A Florida House committee met Monday to continue a search the best way to slash property taxes while educating lawmakers on how these levies both function and support key state institutions.
The 37-member property tax committee, co-chaired by Republican Reps. Vicki Lopez and Toby Overdorf, spent four hours listening to lengthy presentations by top financial leaders on property taxes’ effect on public schools, homesteads, and fiscally constrained counties. It was their third meeting since the committee’s creation during the 2025 session.
“We’re educating, obviously right now, committee members, but hopefully the public is listening to what that would mean in terms of production of any kind of revenue in their businesses,” Lopez, from Miami, told reporters following the meeting. She noted how “complex” it is to determine how to cut property taxes while still keeping public institutions afloat.
Public schools are one state establishment heavily reliant on property taxes paid by homeowners to local governments. According to Jim Zingale, executive director of the Florida Department of Revenue, property taxes make up roughly 47% of the funding that supports public schools. The state foots the other 53%.
Lopez called this “very telling,” while Overdorf, representing Palm City, promised the Legislature would be “crafting” multiple avenues to slashing what some have dubbed the “most hated tax.” But it remains to be seen what that legislation would look like.
Monday’s meeting was largely the informative portion of the property tax committee’s two-day meeting schedule this week. On Tuesday, a more contentious slate includes representatives of local governments explaining how they collect property taxes, and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office, which will present information on his new “DOGE” task force that’s largely blamed local governments for wasteful spending fueled by high property taxes.
Why haven’t property taxes already been cut?
The crux of the dilemma is that property taxes provide a massive source of revenue for large counties like Miami-Dade and funds schools, firefighters, and police stations. Cutting them without providing an additional source of revenue, like raising the sales tax, would result in as much as a $50 billion loss to Florida counties, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
In 2008, then-Speaker of the House Marco Rubio proposed “the swap,” switching sales tax hikes for the property tax. It failed.
Property taxes statewide have risen by more than 45% since 2019, sparking public demands for financial relief. Although DeSantis has been chief among politicos pressuring for the tax to be either decimated or fully eliminated, he has yet to produce a plan beyond suggesting a $1,000 rebate for homesteaders.
DeSantis has eyed local governments as the largest cause for skyrocketed rates, noting that property taxes are collected by municipalities, cities, and counties — not the state. Editing the property tax rate would require an amendment to the Florida Constitution.
Rep. Ryan Chamberlin, a Belleview Republican, told reporters last week that he wants to impose new transaction fees and a slightly raised school sales tax to compensate for lost property tax revenue. His is the first comprehensive plan to be suggested ahead of the 2026 legislative session. However, convincing other conservatives to agree to raising taxes may prove a difficult sell.
Other speakers on Monday included Amy Baker, coordinator for the Legislature’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research, and Lizette Kelly, who works in research and analytics in property tax oversight. They provided extensive information into the demographics of homesteaders (who tend to be older) and definitions of property tax terms including millage rates.
Millage rates are tax rates that local governments use to calculate property tax. It is the dollar amount assessed for each $1,000 of taxable value. This means that a homestead with $300,000 of taxable value at a millage rate of 3 mills for the city would be assessed at $900 for city taxes, Baker explained.

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants, schools and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past several weeks, including offenses related to rodents, cockroaches, long-expired food, moldy hummus and operating without a license.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between July 24 and Sept. 14.  (Earlier this year, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure all food-safety inspection reports for eight days past the date of inspection.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
D’Leon’s Taco Rico, 6826 University Ave., Cedar Falls — During a Sept. 11 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this restaurant for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and indicated that the number of violations indicated “a lack of knowledge about food safety.” In addition, the person in charge was not present at the time of the inspection and none of the staff on site had a food protection manager certificate.
The inspector noted that several items in the walk-in cooler had been left uncovered, risking contamination, and rice was stored in an open container with a soiled lid. Also, the inspector reported, “a bag of lard is being stored inside a soiled cardboard box,” and sauces and topping were being held at 48 degrees, which was too warm to ensure their safety. In addition, several items in the walk-in cooler had no date markings to ensure freshness and safety.
Hometown Market Meats & Deli, 111 E. Robinson St., Knoxville — During a Sept. 11 visit, a state inspector cited this grocery store for eight risk-factor violations. The inspector reported that home-canned pickles and jelly were alongside “consumer canned goods” and had to be removed from the premises. Also, several spices from an unlicensed kitchen were being offered for sale and had to be pulled from the retail-sale shelves.
In addition, cream pies stored in a cold case were being held at temperatures above the maximum of 41 degrees, and several food items – such as pea salad, macaroni salad, ground beef, house-made ranch dressing and the cream pies – had no date markings to ensure freshness and safety.
The inspector also found that several food items – including egg salad, potato salad, macaroni salad and sliced deli meat – had been held longer than the maximum of seven days and had to be discarded. In addition, there was no measurable amount of sanitizer in the chemical dishwashing machine, and some of the items sold in retail cases had no ingredients, sub-ingredients or allergens listed.










Tiny, slimy, larvae-like insects were observed inside of one of the pop-gun holders behind the bar ... Multiple fruit flies were observed congregating around the dish machine in the kitchen and the front pizza prep area.


– Inspector's report on the Treehouse Pub & Eatery in Bettendorf


Treehouse Pub & Eatery, 2239 Kimberly Road, Bettendorf — During a July 25 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for 10 risk-factor violations.
“One container of pine nut roasted hummus in the first prep cooler on the front prep line was observed with a large amount of mold growth present,” the inspector reported. “Several pans of food product were observed being stored inside of the main prep cooler on the cook line without lids or covers. Condensation is dripping inside of the cooler and could lead to food contamination.”
In addition, the inspector reported that three pans of cooked shredded chicken prepared the previous day had yet to cool to 41 degrees and were holding at 43 to 47 degrees. All of the chicken was discarded.
“Multiple fruit flies were observed congregating around the dish machine in the kitchen and the front pizza prep area,” the inspector reported. “Tiny, slimy, larvae-like insects were observed inside of one of the pop-gun holders behind the bar.”
Also, numerous other food products that were in cold-holding units — such as cheese, cooked onions, raw hamburger patties, hummus, black beans and dressings — were measured at well above 41 degrees and were either relocated to other refrigerators or were discarded. The inspector also noted numerous food items that were not date marked to ensure freshness and safety. “An overall lack of date marking is being used on prepared products throughout the facility,” the inspector reported.
In addition, the interior shelves of the pizza prep cooler were marred by a “buildup of soil” and both holsters for the pop-dispensing guns behind the bar were noted as having a buildup of grime. Also, bags of lobster bisque were observed thawing in a large container of standing water in a kitchen sink, and frozen salmon was being thawed while still in vacuum-sealed packaging, increasing the risk that any spoilage would go undetected.

La Herradura Mexican Grill, 540 N. Cody Road, LeClaire — During a Sept. 9 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for seven risk-factor violations. Among the problems: Packages of raw chorizo were stored above packages of raw whole cuts of beef, risking cross-contamination, and  baked potatoes and tamales were stored uncovered inside of a small reach-in cooler.
Also, a steam table was being used to reheat cooked food products that were placed there directly from the cooler. As a result, queso, rice, sauce and spinach queso were observed holding on the steam table at temperatures between 55 to 111 degrees — not hot enough to ensure their safety. The food items had to be removed from the steam table and reheated on the stove or grill to 165 degrees.
The inspector also made note of three pans of prepared food products that had been held beyond the maximum of seven days — including one pan of white rice dated Aug. 31, and two pans of refried beans dated Sept. 2. Also, the restaurant was storing tilapia in the cooler while the fish remained in vacuum-sealed packaging, increasing the risk that any spoilage might go undetected.
Clear Creek Elementary School, 901 S. 14th St., Clear Lake — During a Sept. 8 visit, a Cerro Gordo County inspector cited this school for five violations and found that the hot dogs on the steam tables were holding at 115 to 122 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure their safety. The hot dogs were placed back inside cabinet-style warmers and kitchen management was advised on the timing of assembling hot dogs and placing them on steam tables.
The inspector also reported that cold ham sandwiches and multilayered “stacker” sandwiches were holding at 51 to 55 degrees, which was not cool enough to ensure their safety. The items were placed back into the walk-in cooler and management was advised on time- and temperature-controlled items. The inspector also observed that the soap dispenser at the kitchen’s one handwashing sink was empty and there were no paper towels at the sink.
Kellogg Country Store, 103 Blair St., Kellogg — During a Sept. 8 visit, a state inspector cited this store for six risk-factor violations and noted that the business did not employ a certified food protection manager as required and the person in charge was unaware of regulations that require the reporting of food-borne illnesses.
The inspector also noted that in the hot-holding cases, there were mini tacos holding at 130 degrees, cheese sticks holding at 121 degrees and jalapeño poppers holding at 131 degrees – all too cool to ensure their safety. The food items were discarded. The inspector also observed that the interior of the ice machine was soiled and in need to cleaning, and that the establishment had no probe-type food thermometer to check the temperature of food.
“Kitchen area is cluttered with unused equipment including a conveyor oven, residential style oven, ladder, large house plant, fold-out cot, unused refrigerated prep table, and miscellaneous items,“ the inspector reported.
State records indicate that the last time the store underwent a routine inspection, in February 2022, the owner has assured the state inspector that the store would discontinue food service in the absence of a certified food protection manager, but had since resumed food service that triggered the requirement for such a manager. The inspector gave the owner until March 8, 2026, to employee a certified food protection manager.










Insects observed in pans of prepared food ... Insects observed on floors, equipment and utensils (and) dish sink.


– Inspector's report on Uchu Restaurant and Catering, aka El Sabor Peruano, in Des Moines 


Uchu Restaurant and Catering, aka El Sabor Peruano, 1704 E. Grand Ave., Des Moines — During a July 29 visit, a state inspector cited this restaurant for seven risk-factor violations. The inspector concluded the person in charge was unable to demonstrate knowledge of the 2017 Food Code as evidenced by the violations cited. Pork that was prepared the day before and which had yet to cool to 41 degrees was discarded.
“Insects observed in pans of prepared food on the cold make-table in use during service,” the inspector reported. “Insects observed on floors, equipment and utensils (and) dish sink.”
Range Grill & Golf, 11865 Hickman Road, Urbandale — During a Sept. 8 visit, a state inspector noted an ice buildup on a box of pizza crusts that sat under the condenser inside the walk-in freezer. The pizza crusts were discarded. Also, a food employee was observed handling red peppers and lettuce with their bare hands; chicken breasts were holding at 125 to 133 degrees and had to be reheated on a grill; and refrigerated pasta was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety.
In addition, there were dressings inside the walk-in cooler that had been held for more than the maximum of seven days and which had to be discarded; tuna steaks were not being removed from their vacuum-sealed packaging while thawing, creating an increased risk of any spoilage going undetected; and there were no “tip sensitive thermometers” for checking food temperatures on the premises.
Cheng’s Garden, 1246 E. 14th St., Des Moines — During a Sept. 4 visit, a state inspector cited this restaurant for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector concluded the person in charge was not ensuring proper handwashing by the staff or adhering to the correct process of cooling food items or sanitizing equipment. One worker weas observed exiting the restroom and resuming food preparation without any handwashing taking place in the kitchen. Workers were also seen washing their hands in sinks not designated for that purpose and then drying their hands on an apron worn during the preparation of raw meat.
Also, cut cabbage was being stored at room temperature, multiple refrigerated food items prepared days earlier had no date markings to ensure freshness and safety, and dishes were being washed and dried without any sanitation taking place. The inspector noted there was no prior inspection report posted for the public to see.
State records indicate the restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in December 2023, when it was cited for 16 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number.










Several flies and gnats throughout establishment. Several gnats in bakery case on product.


– Inspector's report on Plazita Latina in Sioux City


Plazita Latina, 1300 W. 4th St., Sioux City — During a Sept. 4 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector cited this restaurant for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Among the problems: The staff handled raw pork and then, without washing their hands, helped a deli customer; a worker was seen eating toast next to the meat saw where other staff snacks and drinks were present; the tropical fruit tamarind, inside the produce cooler, had mold on it; and there were several gnats observed “in and on baked goods” inside the bakery case.
Also, guacamole, salsa, deli meats and cheeses inside the walk-in cooler had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety; the slicer, grinder, knives and bakery trays were all visibly soiled with food debris; there was no hand soap at the designated handwashing sink; packaged breads and bakery items had no allergens listed on the labels; and several food items – including nuts, fruits, salsa, guacamole, and various meats – were not labeled after packaging.
The inspector also determined the store was receiving baked goods from another establishment without any labels. “Owner’s dog on site in office,” the inspector reported. “Electric fly trap is installed over meat grinder. Several flies and gnats throughout establishment. Several gnats in bakery case on product.”
State records indicate the establishment last underwent a routine inspection in September 2022.
La Casa Azul, 708 1st Ave., Coralville — During a July 29 visit, a Johnson County inspector cited this restaurant for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number, and reported that the person in charge was unable to answer questions regarding time and temperature controls used for food safety.
Multiple house-made salsas within the kitchen’s refrigerator were dated July 15, July 18, July 19 and July 20 and had been held for more than maximum of seven days. In addition, multiple cans of Raid insect killer, not approved for use in commercial food establishments, were found.
“Hanging fly traps were above food-preparation areas in the kitchen,” the inspector reported.
As a result of the visit, the Johnson County Public Health Department issued a formal letter of warning to the restaurant.
Rio Grande Mexican Restaurant, 1414 W. Locust St., Davenport — During a Sept. 3 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for nine risk-factor violations and observed that raw eggs and raw beef were stored in direct contact with ready-to-eat foods inside the walk-in cooler, creating a risk of cross-contamination. Also, multiple food items were stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler, and other food items were stored uncovered inside a freezer.
In addition, queso was being held at a temperature of 110 degrees, and had to be reheated to 165 degrees, and salsa that was prepared on Aug. 20 was still being served, well past its seven-day limit. In addition, sauces that were prepared Aug. 10, Aug. 20 and Aug. 24 were still being served and had to be discarded.
“Dish machine is not properly sanitizing dishes and has no sanitizer concentration,” the inspector reported. “Strong odor present in the floor drain around the dish machine and the three-compartment sink.”
The visit was prompted by a complaint alleging “hair in food, no hair restraints present, and sanitation issues.” The inspector reported that no hair was found in any food product, hair restraints were present, and “no sanitation issues were observed in the dining area or in the restrooms.” The complaint was deemed unverified.










Fly-like insects found inside a bottle of Bacardi Limon ...  Mouse-like droppings on the dry-storage room shelves ... Several live cockroach-like insects of varying sizes observed.


– Inspector's report on The Filling Station in Davenport


The Filling Station, 305 E. 35th St., Davenport — During an Aug. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for six risk-factor violations, including the lack of a current food-establishment license and “fly-like insects found inside a bottle of Bacardi Limon at the bar.”
In addition, the inspector found chopped lettuce that was holding at 42 to 44 degrees, and shredded cheese holding at 56 degrees. Both items had been left “sitting out at room temperature,” the inspector reported. “Several items throughout the prep line were missing date marking… Food in the reach-in freezer on the main cook/prep line is not frozen solid… Mouse-like droppings on the dry-storage room shelves and in the cabinet in server station. Several live cockroach-like insects of varying sizes observed near the empty-can cardboard receptacle and on the dry-storage room shelves.”
Sol Agave, 721 E. 1st St., Grimes — During a Sept. 2 visit, a state inspector cited this restaurant for 10 risk-violations, an unusually high number, and concluded the person in charge was not fulfilling their duties as evidenced by the extent of the violations related to the cooling of prepared foods, temperature monitoring, inconsistent date markings, employee health policies and cleaning procedures.
The inspector reported the walk-in cooler was holding food at 45 to 46 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder and that food items were not dated to ensure freshness and safety. “Live pest observed in basement doorway,” the inspector reported. “Owner agrees to have pest control on site tomorrow morning… Paint peeling on ceiling in kitchen and dish room.” The visit was prompted by a non-illness complaint regarding pests. The complaint was deemed verified.
Kinnick Stadium, East Concourse, Aramark Concessions, 825 E. Evashevski Drive, Iowa City — This on-site visit by Johnson County was conducted Aug. 30, during the stadium’s first Iowa Hawkeye football game of the 2025 season. The inspector cited the various concourse concessions with nine risk-factor violations and noted that house-cooked bacon in the hot-holding unit at Concession 271, as well as cooked burgers in multiple hot-holding units at Concession W62, were measured at 100 degrees and had to be rapidly reheated to at least 165 degrees before being returned to the hot-holding unit.
Also, cheese in the cooler at Concession S10 was measured at 52 degrees and had to be moved to the main refrigeration unit to return it to a safe holding temperature. In addition, food debris was observed inside the popcorn machines at Concessions E75 and S25 and the handwashing sink at Concession N28 had no hot water.
In addition, a dead cockroach was observed “in a container” inside the cold-holding unit located at Concession W62. “Excessive debris” was observed on the interior surfaces of the freezer at the same concession, and on the grill surface at Concession N226. The inspector also noted there was no sanitizer available in the kitchen during active food preparation at four of the concession stands.
The inspector’s published report does not identify any of the concessions by their common names, but instead refers to them by alpha-numeric designations used by the stadium and by Aramark.
Beef and Bourbon Chophouse, 1015 Utica Ridge Road Place, Bettendorf — During an Aug. 28 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for nine risk-factor violations. Among the issues: Containers of food were stacked on top of each other inside a cooler, with the lower container left uncovered so the food inside was in direct contact with the container above. Also, one pan of cooked roasted chicken made the previous evening had yet to cool to 41 degrees and had to be discarded, and raw salmon filets, lobster tail and rack of lamb were held in a cooler at 43 to 45 degrees and were moved to a separate refrigerator to rapidly cool.
In addition, several food-contact surfaces in the kitchen were marred by an accumulation of dried food debris and were in need of cleaning and sanitizing. “Numerous fruit flies were observed behind the bar area,” the inspector reported. “Facility has a pest-control operator and will contact them for service.”
Hy-Vee Foods, 2200 W. Kimberly Road, Davenport — During an Aug. 26 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this store for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector noted that the store did not maintain up-to-date parasite-destruction forms required for the seafood product served in the sushi area. Also, the refrigerated pulled pork prepared the previous day was measured at 45 to 47 degrees and had to be discarded as it had yet to cool to 41 degrees.
In addition, several time- and temperature-controlled food items — including shredded cheese, sausage and deli meat — in the open-air refrigerated cases were holding at 44 to 45 degrees, as were several containers of ribs, all of which had to be discarded. The inspector also noted that several items in the Nori Sushi area were being held past their discard date of Aug. 25 — a repeat violation.
The inspector also observed that the dishwashing machine in the bakery was not able to reach the minimum temperature of 160 degrees, and the rice warmers in the Hy-Chi area had an excess buildup of food debris on them. “Several racks in the bakery area have an excess amount of food debris buildup,” the inspector reported, adding that freshly made sushi was improperly left to cool in a small food-prep cooler rather than in the walk-in cooler, as required.
El Patron Authentic Mexican Cuisine, 4351 Merle Hay Road, Des Moines — During an Aug. 25 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for seven risk-factor violations and noted that containers of food inside the coolers were left uncovered and a large pot of soup was left sitting on the floor.
Also, a pan of rice was sitting on a shelf with no temperature control, and needed to be discarded, and salsa was being stored in bucket that originally stored detergent. The visit was prompted by a non-illness complaint regarding pest control.  The complaint deemed verified through a conversation with the manager.










The main kitchen was observed with numerous fruit flies in areas throughout the kitchen. Mouse-like droppings were observed in the pool kitchen along the bottom of the wall.


– Inspector's report on Davenport Country Club in Pleasant Valley


Davenport Country Club, 25500 Valley Drive, Pleasant Valley — During an Aug. 22 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector report that one cooler was observed holding several food products — including cottage cheese, sour cream, cut melon, and ranch dressing — at temperatures of 43 to 45 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder. A different cooler was holding lettuce, cheese, sliced and diced tomatoes, and dressings at 45 to 52 degrees.
In addition, food-contact surfaces throughout the property were marred by “a buildup of soil, food debris (and) grime,” and a spray can of insect killer, not approved for use in commercial kitchens, was found.
“The main kitchen was observed with numerous fruit flies in areas throughout the kitchen,” the inspector reported. “Mouse-like droppings were observed in the pool kitchen along the bottom of the wall.”
Cabos Cantina & Grill, 5717 Elmore Ave., Davenport — During an Aug. 19 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for nine risk-factor violations, including workers handling ready-to-eat foods with their bare hands. In addition, raw pork was being stored in the same container as raw beef, risking cross-contamination, and multiple food products in the kitchen, storage area and the walk-in cooler were left uncovered, risking environmental contamination.
Also, the ice machine was marred by “debris and gunk,” and three different sauces that were marked with dates in July were still being served. “Sauce dated July 18, 2025, can only be served till the end of the day on July 18,2025,” the inspector advised the management.
The inspector also reported spotting “one live roach and several dead roaches” in the restaurant. The visit was prompted by a complaint concerning cockroaches and was deemed verified.
Sprockets, 2314 University Ave., Des Moines — During an Aug. 19 visit, a state inspector cited this restaurant for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the problems: The person in charge was not a certified food protection manager; refrigerated cooked pork made two days prior had yet to cool to 41 degrees and had to be discarded;  tomatoes cut the previous day were measured at 47 degrees and were discarded; and cooked pork, marinated meats and other items in the reach-in cooler were not dated to ensure freshness and safety.
“Presence of common flies not controlled,” the inspector reported without elaborating.  The visit was prompted by a complaint of an unspecified nature. Management at the restaurant was not aware of the complaint, which the inspector deemed unverified.
Duck City Deli & Bistro, 115 E. 3rd St., Davenport — During an Aug. 14 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for six risk-factor violations, noting that food in the kitchen’s walk-in cooler, such as whole raw duck, registered at 51 degrees — well above the 41-degree maximum. As a result, all temperature-controlled food products in the cooler were discarded.
“Mouse-like droppings found on the wood shelving in basement where canned goods are stored,” the inspector reported. “Floors, walls, and ceiling in the kitchen has excess grease and food debris on it.”
Shelving in the walk-in cooler and kitchen for clean equipment were each reported as being marred by excess food debris, as were the stainless steel racks used for food storage.
Gramma’s Kitchen and Checkered Flag, 3408 Plainview Road, Walcott — During an Aug. 13 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for nine risk-factor violations. The inspector noted that waffle mix, pancake mix and French toast egg wash each were holding at 49 degrees inside a cooler and had to be discarded.
Also, there were several food items in all of the coolers throughout the kitchen that no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. In addition, the inspector reported finding sliced roast beef in a walk-in cooler that was dated July 30, a full two weeks before the inspection, as well as homemade dressing dated Aug. 2, and cooked pork sausage dated Aug. 4.
“Insect-like bugs found in the liquor bottle wells in the bar area,” the inspector reported. “Shelving throughout the kitchen has excess food debris and grease … Ceiling and walls has excess food dust and grease on them.”

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The pilot of a small plane that crashed on Block Island in July, fatally injuring a passenger, was using the wrong radio frequency when approaching the runway on two of his three attempts to land, according to a preliminary investigation report.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report posted Friday suggests a gust of wind and insufficient runway space contributed to the July 30 crash at Block Island State Airport that killed a New York county legislator.
The Piper PA-28-181 left Albany International Airport just before 11 a.m. on July 30, heading to New Shoreham for lunch with the pilot and two passengers on board, according to the report. 
Passenger Dan Wilson, 77, a Montgomery Councilor, died as a result of the crash. 
Investigators wrote the pilot began his descent about 20 nautical miles from Block Island’s airport. As he approached runway 10, he saw an airplane departing and began a go-around. He attempted to land a second time, but was too close to the runway on the final approach.
The pilot made a third attempt, but federal federal investigators wrote that the plane overran the runway and hit the nearby trees in a canopy about 50 feet off the ground.
“As the pilot applied the brakes, the airplane’s right wing lifted due to a gust of wind,” the report stated.
Runway 10, the island’s runway, is 2,501 feet long, the shortest runway of Rhode Island’s six state airports.
The NTSB report states that air traffic controllers repeatedly warned the pilot he was using the wrong radio frequency. Although the pilot acknowledged the correction, investigators said he continued on the original frequency and used it to report his position for two of the three runway approaches. The report does not specify which approaches the pilot used the wrong frequency.
The plane owned by Condair Flyers Flying Club in Latham, New York crashed at 12:10 p.m. and was “substantially damaged,” according to the report.
The pilot, who is not named in the report, was seriously injured. The surviving passenger’s injuries were reported to be minor. 
The wind conditions at the time were reported as 7 knots, considered a gentle breeze. Visibility was 10 miles, according to the NTSB’s report.

(Screenshot of Department of Education livestream)COLUMBIA — When Kate Selvitelli started the Diversity Awareness Youth Literacy Organization chapter at her Charleston County high school, the book club had just three members: Selvitelli and her two best friends.
Two years later, with the help of some public speaking and homemade brownies, the chapter has grown to more than 50 students at Academic Magnet High School, making it the largest of the seven chapters across the state.
The group, which started in Beaufort County four years ago, has gotten local and national attention for pushing back against the removal of books from school libraries, but its goal is more broadly to promote literacy, whether that means advocating to keep books on school library shelves, volunteering to read to toddlers, or simply showing up to discuss books, said Selvitelli and other club members.
“It’s not like you have to be out there fighting banned books,” said Selvitelli, a high school senior. “We’re going to make friends, we’re going to meet up once a week, and anyone can join, even if you don’t agree with all of our political stuff.”
10 more books must be removed from SC public K-12 schools, board rules

The number of students in each chapter varies. While Selvitelli has recruited around 50 students, the Beaufort chapter has around 20 students, and Greenville has about 15. Columbia’s chapter at Spring Valley High School in Richland 2 is starting from the ground up after all its members graduated, said recent graduate Elliot Naddell.
The group, which exists only in South Carolina, started as a book club. A then-student in Beaufort County wanted to discuss books with classmates that they might not normally choose for themselves or get assigned in class. Two years later, the group’s focus expanded when two parents challenged 97 books in the Beaufort County School District’s libraries, members said.
DAYLO members showed up to school board meetings to ask that books remain on the shelves. After temporarily removing all 97, the board eventually returned all but five of the books to school libraries. With the approval of a state-level regulation in February 2024 barring schools from carrying books that contain sexual content, the club’s advocacy work expanded across the Palmetto State, members said.
The club’s advocacy has thrust it into the spotlight, including becoming the focus of a feature-length documentary and earning Selvitelli an award from the National Education Association. But the club is not just an advocacy organization, members said. Nor is it an ordinary book club, said Emily Alaia, president of the chapter at Battery Creek High School in Beaufort.
“I think people misconstrue it as a boring book club where everybody just talks about the book and has to write book reports about it,” said Alaia, a junior. “I wish that they would come sit in and listen to the conversation and hear how meaningful it is.”
Advocacy
When the state Board of Education met to approve a regulation barring “sexual conduct” from school books in February 2024, DAYLO members were there to voice their opposition.
“Books with inclusive representation have always been my favorites because they let me experience what it’s like to be in other people’s shoes,” Selvitelli said during public comment. “I would not be the supportive, caring, learned person I am today without these books or my excellent teachers and librarians.”
The board unanimously approved the regulation, saying they wanted to make sure the books offered in schools are age-appropriate and create an appeals process for parents who disagreed with a school district’s decision to keep a certain book on library shelves. The regulation automatically took effect in June 2024.
School librarians have been required to remove 21 books since then because of depictions of explicit sexual conduct. Six other books, including classics such as “1984” and “To Kill a Mockingbird,” have been allowed to stay, one (“Crank”) with the caveat that students get parental permission to read it.
The board hasn’t voted on a potential removal since May, when board members asked the Beaufort County School District to revisit its decisions with the added context of the regulation, following a meeting where board members questioned the regulation they put in place.
No vote on removing books from schools as SC education board questions own rule

Getting up in front of rooms full of adults and addressing the school boards, whether at a state or local level, was nerve-wracking at first, Selvitelli said. She doesn’t mind public speaking, but at 17 years old, she’s often one of the youngest people in the room. Even when it seems intimidating, though, students should speak up about issues that affect them, she said.
“None of us can vote yet,” Selvitelli said. “We can’t make any of these decisions. We’re just there, speaking our voices, using our education, and I think it’s really important (for adults) to see the next generation being like, ‘Hey, guys, we’re watching. We know what’s happening.’”
Removing books from shelves goes against DAYLO’s pro-literacy goal, members said. The clubs have chosen several of the removed books as monthly reads, including “All Boys are Blue,” a series of essays about author George M. Johnson’s experience growing up a gay Black man, and “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” a coming-of-age book about an introverted teen’s freshman year of high school.
In Beaufort, the Battery Creek High School chapter of DAYLO finished “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” a week before the Board of Education voted to remove it from shelves, Alaia said. The book resonated with Alaia, and she imagined it would mean even more to students struggling with similar anxieties as the main character, she said.
“It’s just really frustrating,” Alaia said. “Reading the books and understanding how much of an impact that they had on me, I can’t imagine what they would do for other kids.”
Community service
DAYLO’s mission of promoting literacy goes beyond students’ schools, members said. A key part of the club is giving back to the community in a way that encourages reading.

On the first Saturday of each month, DAYLO members put out blankets, books and teddy bears at the Port Royal Farmers Market. Volunteers read stories to children and their families, and children sometimes go home with free, donated books.
The teddy bear picnic draws volunteers from across the state, but chapters can choose their own community service projects.
Academic Magnet High School, for instance, collects books to donate to other schools in the area, along with participating in the teddy bear picnics, Selvitelli said.
Over the summer, members of the Greenville High School chapter opened a Little Free Library, a small box where people can take or leave books as needed, outside Pendleton Place, an emergency shelter for children entering foster care, said Harper Crindland-Hughes, a junior and the chapter’s president. The chapter is planning a book drive to keep the library stocked, she said.
As someone who didn’t enjoy reading growing up, Alaia said she supports any chance to get a book in front of a person. She learned to love reading only by doing it as often as possible, and she wants other people to have that experience, she said.
“I think that’s something everyone should try, is to pick up a book, read it and grow empathy from it,” Alaia said.
Building life skills
As Alaia worried over a big presentation in English class, she thought back to all the times she had spoken in front of her DAYLO club. If Alaia, a self-described introvert who generally prefers science and math classes, could talk about books in front of a book club, certainly she could do the same in front of a class, she thought.
“I was just kind of like, ‘Oh my gosh,’ like, ‘I’m really doing this,’” Alaia said. “I’m putting myself out there, and it was really because of DAYLO.”
As much as the club focuses on reading books, it’s also about building life skills, such as confidence and empathy, students said.
New rules on ‘age-appropriate’ books in SC classrooms set for automatic approval

Much of that comes from reading books that reflect different experiences than what might have happened in a student’s life. How each chapter selects books varies — Selvitelli’s club has a different student choose each month, while a chapter in Greenville County votes on its books — but they all must represent some perspective not every student shares, students said.
That doesn’t always mean choosing books removed from school libraries.
Students at Battle High School read “The Hate U Give,” which follows a 16-year-old girl who lives in a poor neighborhood but attends a wealthy prep school after a police officer shoots and kills her childhood friend.
Greenville High School’s DAYLO chapter started with Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar,” first published in 1963, about a young woman whose mental health suffers under the pressures of adulthood, to learn more about mental health, Crindland-Hughes said. The book club followed it up with the 2017 novel “They Both Die at the End,” to contrast a more modern take on mental health, she said.
Those types of books are important for students who might be facing similar issues to recognize their own struggles, Crindland-Hughes said. And if students can’t relate to the books, “you can see a perspective of what (others) are going through and use that in real life to just be more considerate of people around you,” she said.

(Photo from Ball State University)A Ball State University employee who lost her job after she posted about the late Charlie Kirk will use Indiana’s courts to litigate the case. Suzanne Swierc’s firing and other retaliatory actions — against educators, media columnists, comedians and more — have alarmed free speech advocates in the wake of Kirk’s targeted assassination.
Kirk, a conservative activist with personal ties to personal ties to President Donald Trump and other top Republican leaders, was shot at Utah Valley University event on Sept. 10 and died soon after. A defender of both free speech and the Second Amendment, Kirk was infamous for his inflammatory rhetoric.
“Let me be clear: if you think Charlie Kirk was a wonderful person, we can’t be friends. His death is a tragedy, and I can and do feel for his wife and children,” Swierc posted that day, according to a screenshot included in her legal complaint. “I believe in the Resurrection, and while it’s difficult, I can and do pray for his soul. Charlie Kirk’s death is a reflection of the violence, fear, and hatred he sowed. It does not excuse his death, AND it’s a sad truth. The shooting is a tragedy, and I can and do feel for a college campus experiencing an active shooter situation.
“The deaths of Melissa and Mark Hortman, the children shot and killed in Minneapolis last month, and the children shot in Colorado today are all tragedies that also deserve your attention. Charlie Kirk excused the deaths of children in the name of the second amendment,” Swierc’s post finished.
Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were targeted for her role as a Democrat in that state’s legislature. Two children were shot at a Minnesota Catholic school in August. Two students were hospitalized in a Colorado shooting and another student, the shooter, died the same day as Kirk.
In the filing, Sweirc said she’d restricted her Facebook privacy settings to “close friends” prior to making the post, but it was screenshotted and shared publicly. It went viral in conservative circles. 
DCS worker out amid other fallout from Kirk assassination

“I do not regret the post I made and I would not take back what I said. I believe that I, along with every other person in this country, have First Amendment rights to be able to speak on a number of things,” Swierc said in a virtual press conference Monday.
“Sept. 12, the day that my private post was made public without my consent, was one of the worst days of my life. I was terrified most of that day with some of the messages, phone calls and voicemails I was receiving to my personal number, to my work accounts,” she continued.
Swierc said she’d shared one death threat — which included her full address — to local law enforcement. Swierc worked as the director of health promotion and advocacy under Ball State’s student affairs division.
 Additional fallout

Swierc will be represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana. The organization argued that Sweirc didn’t forfeit her rights when Ball State — a public university — hired her in 2023.

“Government employees don’t give up their First Amendment rights just to become employees of the government,” said Stevie Pactor, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. “They, still, are entitled to their own personal opinions that they are free to express online or in other forums, so long as those are being made in their personal capacity.” 
Ball State declined to comment on pending litigation on Monday, but previously defended Swierc’s firing in a public statement. 
The ACLU is seeking an injunction that would expunge any record of the termination from Ball State’s archives, alongside damages. Swierc isn’t looking to go back to the university.
Pactor noted that Sweirc didn’t cause the post to go viral and said others could be caught up in the same cycle.
“I think, unfortunately, this is unlikely to be the sole occurrence,” Pactor said. “… who knows how many people will ultimately be impacted by this? But I think this is the beginning and not the end.”
The Chronicle of Higher Education, in a Sept. 17 story, cataloged more than two-dozen disciplinary actions against faculty, staff and students nationwide for posts related to Kirk — including firings, suspensions and expulsions. The count doesn’t include Ball State.
At least one state employee, with the Department of Child Services, resigned after posting about Kirk.
In perhaps the most high-profile example, comedian Jimmy Kimmel was briefly suspended from his show following comments about Kirk’s death before being reinstated on Monday.
Conservative backlash
Prominent Republicans have sought to punish those who “celebrated” the assassination. In Indiana, Gov. Mike Braun has threatened teaching licenses, arguing that “calls for political violence are not freedom of speech and should not be tolerated.”
Attorney General Todd Rokita has dedicated a section of his “Eyes on Education” portal to posts about Kirk, posting cases — including Sweirc’s — online. There were 19 flagged posts as of Monday afternoon, with potentially “hundreds” more being submitted. He has emphasized that his office isn’t investigating anyone listed in the portal, but is posting them for parental “transparency.”

“Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our Republic, but it does not shield individuals from the consequences of their words, especially when they are public servants who are getting paid with taxpayer dollars,” Rokita said. “Statements that celebrate or glorify violence are deeply concerning, particularly when made by those entrusted with shaping young minds.”
He shared a modified version of Sweirc’s post to his social media account, and included her Ball State biography. 
First Amendment cases also include protections from a so-called “heckler’s veto,” in which speech is silenced because of disruptive reactions — or anticipated responses — from an audience.
“Essentially, what Ball State is trying to have here is a heckler’s veto because they got negative feedback from other people, and that’s … not an injury to them that the First Amendment tolerates,” Pactor said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-22 20:55:50+00:00,CT Mirror,CT health experts raise growing vaccine hesitancy concerns as federal guidance shifts,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/22/ct-vaccine-hesitancy-federal-guidance/,"Connecticut public health experts, including medical school deans and primary care providers, are concerned about increasing vaccine hesitancy.","Public health experts raised concerns on Monday about increasing vaccine hesitancy among patients in the wake of shifting federal guidance, despite Connecticut having some of the highest vaccination rates in the country. 
The meeting of infectious disease experts was convened by Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani to hear their thoughts on vaccine policy.
The group discussed challenges posed by recent federal changes and how to prepare for potential future shifts. 
During the most recent legislative session, in anticipation of changes to public health policy under the Trump administration, lawmakers passed a measure allowing the DPH commissioner to create an advisory committee related to federal recommendations.
Juthani said the legislation was meant as “an opportunity to bring together voices” “in a time of change in the public health space.”
“What I think we’re facing right now in Connecticut is a lot of confusion,” Juthani said. “It is very difficult to discern information when there may be information overload, and it’s also unclear what exact decisions and ramifications there are when there are changes at the federal level.”
The panel of 14 experts included the deans of public health and medical schools as well as public policy experts and primary care providers. 
Monday’s discussion in part focused on vaccine policy decisions issued last week by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. The committee’s recommendations dictate who’s eligible for certain vaccines and whether the shots will be covered by insurance.
Several of the experts acknowledged that the shifting recommendations would only confuse the public and admitted that they were having trouble understanding the implications for some of the changes themselves. 
On Friday, ACIP recommended the COVID-19 booster should be based on an individual’s own preferences and conversations with their providers, reversing years of guidance that all people 6 months and older should get the shot. 
Juthani pointed to a recent announcement from AHIP, the national association of health plans, that its members would continue to cover the booster through 2026, regardless of ACIP guidance.
Even though most people who want boosters would still likely have access to them in the short term, several providers said the recommendation was likely to spark confusion for patients about whether they should get the shot. 
The committee also discussed a change to the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Children under 4, according to new guidance, should not receive a single shot for all four diseases, and instead get one shot for measles, mumps and rubella and a second separate dose for varicella, or chicken pox. 
Only 17% of children in Connecticut under 4 receive MMRV as a single dose, with the vast majority already receiving them separately, in compliance with the updated guidance, according to Juthani. But, again, several providers expressed concern about the broader implications of the change.
“What I am seeing is that this recommendation that was put out by ACIP is just further confusing parents, making them more distrustful of vaccines, making our jobs harder,” Barbara Ziogas, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, said. “We’re going to see more and more distrust of our system.”
Katherine Noble, a Fairfield County-based pediatrician, said she is already seeing evidence of rising vaccine hesitancy beyond the COVID-19 booster.
“Our biggest concern on the ground is that we’re seeing such an increase in general vaccine hesitancy,” Noble said. “I’m much more concerned about measles and MMR compliance than I am about the COVID vaccine.”
The advisory committee meeting marks the latest move by Connecticut to take charge of public health at the state and regional level in the face of uncertainty over federal public health policy. 
Earlier this month, Gov. Ned Lamont issued a slew of executive actions seeking to protect COVID-19 vaccine access in Connecticut amid recent federal changes.
Last week, the administration announced the establishment of the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, a coalition of seven states, including Connecticut, and New York City to “promote and protect evidence-based public health” by collaborating on issues like vaccine recommendations and infectious disease management.
Juthani said she anticipates convening the group again following ACIP meetings currently scheduled for Oct. 21 and 22. The committee is expected to discuss delaying hepatitis B vaccines for newborns.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210726_ManishaJuthani_Hartford_YK_180-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-22 16:58:11.574398

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana businesses will pay less in unemployment taxes following an across-the-board reduction to jobless benefits that took effect at the beginning of this year.

The employer tax will drop from approximately $98 to $89 per employee making at least $7,700 per year starting Jan. 1. For most businesses, the change should work out to approximately 9% in tax savings. 
At the same time, maximum benefits for the unemployed will increase 2.5% from $275 to $282. 
The changes are the result of the expectation that Louisiana’s unemployment insurance trust fund will reach $1.2 billion in August 2026. A projected balance of $1.15 billion automatically triggers the reduction in employer taxes and a boost in benefits under state law. 

The modest bump in weekly unemployment payments won’t make up for a much larger cut in those benefits that went into effect at the beginning of this year, however. 

Unemployed people eligible for maximum benefits will receive $84 to $140 more per year as a result of the discussed change, but those same workers are expected to lose over $3,600 in benefits this year. 
Through a new law passed last year, Gov. Jeff Landry and Louisiana lawmakers reduced the cap on receiving unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 12 or 20 weeks, depending on the state unemployment rate. 

As a result, people who were previously entitled to $7,150 in unemployment support annually will only be able to receive $3,384 to $5,640 per year moving forward. The length of time a person can receive unemployment benefits is now tied to the state unemployment rate. 

When the average unemployment rate is under 5%, as it is now, a person can only receive unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 weeks. As the unemployment rate rises, the length of time a person can receive benefits lengthens until it reaches a maximum of 20 weeks when the rate is 8.5% or higher. 
Another set of new requirements will also come into play Dec. 31 under another new law. 

People seeking unemployment benefits will have to prove they have done five searches for work for every week they expect to access a payment. Currently, they are required to show three work searches under state rules. 

The Louisiana Workforce Commission will also be able to disqualify people from receiving unemployment benefits if they don’t show up for a scheduled job interview. 
Those who support the new restrictions say they will encourage people to seek work more aggressively after losing their jobs. Critics counter that Louisiana’s unemployment benefits are so meager that people aren’t intentionally staying on unemployment in lieu of paid work. 

“It’s $275 per week. I don’t think anyone is getting rich on unemployment,” Louis Reine, president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO, said during a legislative hearing in 2024.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 16:58:11.574398

More than 120 people who invested in the redevelopment of Burke Mountain, then were defrauded in a high-profile scandal that rocked Vermont, are set to receive some of their money back. 
The foreign investors will get about one-third of their investment from the recent sale of the resort and a previous settlement with a financial institution.
Michael Goldberg, the lawyer overseeing the Northeast Kingdom’s resort receivership for more than 10 years, gained approval last week from a federal judge to distribute $183,322 to each of the 121 EB-5 investors in the Burke Mountain ski area. 
Each of those investors put up at least $500,000 through the federal visa program in hopes of obtaining permanent U.S. residency, or green cards. To receive that, their investment in the resort would have had to meet certain job creation requirements. 
The resort eventually fell into receivership when the developers were accused by regulators of misusing funds they obtained from EB-5 investors for not only the Burke Mountain development, but upgrades and expansion at nearby Jay Peak ski resort and projects in Newport.
Jay Peak resort had previously sold for $76 million with EB-5 investors who put money into projects at that ski area also receiving pay outs from proceeds of that sale.
In April, Goldberg, a court-appointed receiver, reached a deal earlier this year to sell the Burke Mountain resort for $11.5 million to Bear Den Partners LLC, a group of entities with longstanding ties to the ski area. 
Goldberg late last week received approval to distribute the proceeds from that sale to the foreign investors as well as another roughly $10 million from a larger settlement he had reached with the financial firm Raymond James. Raymond James had handled transactions for one of the resort’s developers: Ariel Quiros, who owned both Jay Peak and Burke Mountain ski areas at the time.
All totaled, the receiver wrote in his court filing last week, he had roughly $22 million to distribute equally to the 121 foreign investors in Burke Mountain, or $183,322 each, representing about 36% of the $500,000 they each contributed.
That resolution, Goldberg added, “treats all Burke investors equitably based on their original investments.” 
The EB-5 development projects in northern Vermont were led by Quiros as well as former Jay Peak resort president and CEO Bill Stenger and attorney William Kelly, a close adviser to Quiros. 
All three were indicted on federal criminal charges in 2019 and later sentenced to prison, specifically for their roles in one of the EB-5 financed projects in Newport that never came to fruition, the construction of a $110 million biomedical research facility. 
Goldberg has served as the receiver overseeing the properties at the center of the financial scandal since 2016. That’s when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission first brought a civil enforcement action in connection with the developments and the misuse of the funds. 
Regulators brought that action in federal court in Miami, which was where Quiros resided in 2016 and where many of his other business entities were located. 
Judge Darrin P. Gayles, who presides in federal court in Miami and oversees Goldberg’s receivership, on Friday approved Goldberg’s fund distribution plan to the Burke Mountain EB-5 investors. 
Goldberg could not be reached Monday for comment.

OJ Daring moved from sunny Jamaica to snowy Vermont. While the winters were cold, his passion for film burned bright. With support from VSAC’s GEAR UP program, he is pursuing film and finance at Champlain College. This GEAR UP Week, we celebrate students like OJ who are turning dreams into direction.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  From island heat to Ver[...]","“I’ve always been interested in videos and editing,” OJ Daring says. “In high school, I used to edit all kinds of things, making shorts just for fun. That’s when I started thinking maybe I could actually do this as a career.”
His curiosity led him to enroll in Burlington Technical Center, where he was able to explore film a little more. “Being at the tech center gave me space to get better and enjoy it. I was surrounded by people who were into the same things—making projects, learning the equipment, working on technical assignments. It felt like the right fit.”
Now a senior at Champlain College, OJ is double majoring in film and finance. “Film was always my main focus. Finance came in because money is always in the back of my mind. If I want to start a business or just understand how things work, that’s going to help me.”
From Jamaica to Vermont
OJ came to Vermont from Jamaica when he was eight years old to live with his dad. “I moved here in the summer, and it was so mild. Then winter came,” he says, laughing. “The first year you see the snow, you get the eggnog. You’re amazed. Three years into it, the shine starts to wear off. Snowstorms, all the layers—and I was still cold even with all the gear! That’s when I got into cozy culture. My favorite thing to do is watch Christmas movies.”
High school was where OJ started testing out his interests. “I was in leadership programs and ran track. At the tech center, I worked on short projects, learned how to use the equipment, and really got into storytelling through film. My advisor Jason talked to me about different paths—traditional college programs or the independent route, like making music videos or filming for businesses. I ended up going the traditional route with my education, but I still do independent projects on the side.”
Those side projects turned into real work experience. “I’ve filmed campaign videos, events, and projects for individuals and businesses. I’ve worked for Champlain’s marketing department. Right now, I’m interning with a real estate company doing video tours of their listings.”
Early College through Community College of Vermont also gave him a boost. “I graduated during COVID, but I already had more than 25 college credits. That made it easier to double major at Champlain, since a lot transferred.”
Support from GEAR UP
OJ’s family was very supportive of his dreams. “In the Caribbean, you take school seriously,” he says. “My mom is a nurse with a master’s degree, and she was very focused on me doing well. She always told me I needed to figure out what I was going to do and where I was going to study. My dad didn’t go to college—he works for the City of Winooski—but he wanted me to do something. He wasn’t going to tell me what, but he wanted me to do something.”
Yet, OJ didn’t exactly know where to start and took things one step at a time. He took part in VSAC’s GEAR UP program, and that’s where his VSAC counselor came in. “GEAR UP was one of the biggest supports for me,” he says. “Starting in eighth grade, I had an advisor who talked to me about loans, tuition sticker price, internships, study abroad, all of that. They put me in the right mindset and helped me stay on track. If I was doing it on my own, I might have figured some of it out, but I wouldn’t have come as far. They supported me so much.”
GEAR UP, short for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, places counselors in schools to help students—especially in underserved communities—prepare for education and training after high school. VSAC has run the program in Vermont for decades.
OJ describes the GEAR UP workshops as especially helpful. “We did workshops on financial literacy, college applications, FAFSA—everything. FAFSA has a handful of questions that don’t feel super direct, and GEAR UP helped me figure them out. They made it easy to fill it all out and feel confident. They also had dedicated FAFSA nights where you could get help right on the spot.”
The support continues even now. “GEAR UP still helps me review my financial aid package every year. And they help with other things too, like paying for books. This semester, my book list was really expensive, and GEAR UP stepped in. It really makes a difference,” he says.
Champlain College ticked all the boxes
When it came time to choose a college, OJ relied on the network of support he had built. “They helped me understand loans, the whole Early College process so I could earn credits while in high school, and what to look for in a college.”
He toured colleges in Vermont, Boston, and Syracuse—some with the help of VSAC. “If I didn’t have that support, I would have had way more questions, and I would have been a lot more stressed. The hardest part was just waiting for responses. But when Champlain came back with an offer, it ticked all the boxes—study abroad, internships, and the programs I wanted. I still think it was the best decision.”
One of the highlights of OJ’s college experience was his recent study abroad opportunity in New Zealand. “I’m jealous of myself three months ago,” he says. “It was a totally different environment than I’m used to. I took a media and perspectives class from a New Zealand point of view, and a business class where I got to see what was similar and different compared to Burlington. It gave me a new perspective on film and business, but also on life in general.” 
Study abroad opportunities were a priority for OJ when he applied to college and the experience he had with Champlain exceeded his expectations.
Aiming his lens to the world
Now in his final year at Champlain, OJ is open to where his path will take him. “I have a lot of different ideas. Hollywood has always been the dream, but I could also see myself going the niche route—working in marketing for a company, or starting a business of my own. I want to be able to support myself, and I’ll see where I am at the end of next year.”
In the meantime, he’s staying active on campus as a member of the GEAR UP alumni committee. 
Looking back, OJ says the support made all the difference. “The process was smooth for me because of VSAC and GEAR UP. If I didn’t have that, I would have had a harder time. They helped me through the confusion, answered my questions, and made me feel confident.”

Without congressional action, more than 7 million people who buy their health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces will pay much higher premiums next year.  (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Without congressional action, more than 7 million people who buy their health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces would pay much higher premiums next year. Close to 5 million of them wouldn’t be able to absorb the price hike – nor would they be able to afford to buy coverage anywhere else, according to a new analysis.
The study by the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that in eight states (Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia) the number of people buying subsidized insurance from the marketplace would drop by at least half. Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic white people, and young adults would see the largest increases in the number of insured.
Enrollment in marketplace coverage surged from 11.4 million people in 2020 to 24.3 million this year, largely because of enhanced federal subsidies first made available by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Unless Congress extends the subsidies, they will expire at the end of this year.
The Urban Institute projects that in 2026, the average premium paid by individuals or households with incomes below 250% of the federal poverty level (250% of the federal poverty level is $39,125 for an individual) would be $919, up from $169. Premiums would more than double, from $1,171 to $2,455, for people with incomes from 250% to 400% of the federal poverty level. And they would nearly double, from $4,436 to $8,471, for people with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level.
Jessica Banthin, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said in an interview that the expiration of the tax credits would leave millions without access to any affordable health care options. She also noted that it likely would raise the cost of insurance for those who do remain on the marketplaces.
“People who are sicker will make the effort or find the money to stay enrolled,” Banthin said. “People who are healthier are more likely to leave the marketplace and either find another source of coverage or stay uninsured — they’re more likely to risk it.”
“And so what that means is the people remaining in the marketplace are a little bit sicker on average than they were before, and that means the risk pool is more costly, and premiums go up across the board.”
Last week, Democratic governors from 18 states sent a letter to congressional leaders of both parties, urging them to extend the subsidies.
“The timing couldn’t be more urgent. Insurers are already setting 2026 rates. If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall,” the letter said. “If not, the damage will be felt for years.”
Congressional Republicans recognize the political peril in allowing the credits to expire less than a year before the midterm elections. Earlier this month, 10 GOP representatives introduced legislation that would extend the subsidies for one year. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters last week that GOP leaders are open to addressing the issue of the expiring credits but not until later this year.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Prosecutors are expected to ask lawmakers next session for additional dollars to recruit and retain attorneys, specifically in rural areas.
But members of the District Attorneys Council are still considering the best strategy to draw more attorneys into their offices without harming their counterparts in other parts of the state.
Nearly a majority of the state’s 27 district attorneys are suffering from an inability to recruit and retain attorneys, said District Attorneys Council Chairman Kyle Cabelka, who serves as the top prosecutor for Comanche and Cotton counties.
“I’ve had one position open for assistant district attorney just before I became the district attorney, so for almost six years,” Cabelka said. “It’s just increasingly difficult to get someone to move down to southwest Oklahoma.”
Multiple statewide counties are grappling with an overall shortage of lawyers, according to the Oklahoma Bar Association. 
An estimated 20 Oklahoma counties have been classified as a “legal desert,” meaning they have fewer than one licensed attorney for every 1,000 people, while another 29 had fewer than 1.5 lawyers per 1,000 residents, according to the group’s analysis.
Oklahoma prosecutors are feeling the impact of those shortages, and are weighing the pros and cons of several proposals that they hope might help draw more people into the profession.
One idea is to create a fund that would pay attorneys to work in certain areas for a specific amount of time.
But Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said he’s concerned that the fund could be used to lure prosecutors, who work in his office, to rural areas of the state.
Kunzweiler said Monday he wants to help rural prosecutors, but not at the expense of protecting his community.
He worked as a rural prosecutor for 12 years before landing in Tulsa.
“There have been occasions I felt like I was the farm team for rural jurisdictions,” Kunzweiler said.
Once he gets a prosecutor trained, they are lured away by a rural district attorney for more money, he said.
Another idea prosecutors are mulling is a loan forgiveness program.
Under that plan, prosecutors who work in a rural jurisdiction for five years would receive a lump sum payment to their student loan lender at the conclusion of their commitment, according to a document provided by the council.
District attorneys said they might also need a position in the District Attorneys Council that focuses on workforce development and recruiting attorneys.
They also briefly considered, then rejected,
a plan that would waive property taxes for five years for attorneys who sign a contract and agree to purchase a home in certain areas.
Kunzweiler said the property tax system is set up to pay for certain services and infrastructure, and he disagrees with carving out exceptions to benefit small segments of society.

She is one of the first Democratic candidates to enter the race, joining voting rights advocate Adrian Consonery Jr.
The secretary of state is responsible for overseeing elections across the state, granting business licenses for a variety of professions, and managing Georgia’s securities market. Brown Reynolds’ campaign is focused on protecting Georgians’ voting rights, supporting small businesses, protecting senior citizens and other vulnerable communities from fraud, and restoring public trust in government. 
“Government exists to serve the people, not partisanship or personal gain,” she said in a press release announcing her candidacy. “Every Georgian, no matter their zip code, age or income, deserves dignity, fairness, and the chance to succeed. I’m running because I believe in a Georgia for all of us; a Georgia where democracy works and leaders lead with integrity.”
In 2022, she was nominated to a senior position within the U.S. Department of Agriculture under former President Joe Biden, where she helped lead the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. She is also known for the 2008-2009 reality TV show “Family Court with Judge Penny.”
Brown Reynolds has secured a key endorsement from former Gov. Roy Barnes, for whom she once worked as his executive counsel. Barnes, who was the last Democratic governor of Georgia, is also chairing Brown Reynolds’ campaign.
“Judge Penny has the vision, integrity, and proven record to lead,” Barnes said. “Georgia needs a secretary of state who can restore confidence, protect our democracy, and get results for everyone — that’s why I’m proud to support her.”
On the Republican side, three major candidates have launched their own campaigns, including Gabriel Sterling, the secretary of state’s former chief operating officer; Kelvin King, a former U.S. Senate candidate and husband of State Election Board member Janelle King; and state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican and the chairman of a House study committee on elections. Current Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has launched a bid for governor.

Horhn and Fitch held a joint press conference Monday morning in front of Jackson city hall to highlight that the city’s fire and police stations would now be stocked with the opioid overdose-reversing medication naloxone. It’s part of Fitch’s “One Pill Can Kill” campaign, a public awareness effort not funded by opioid settlement money to prevent fatal fentanyl overdoses.
Horhn spoke about the urgent need to prevent overdoses as he, Fitch, Interim Jackson Police Chief Tyree Jones and Interim Fire Chief Rasean Thomas stood in front of media microphones. 
“Anything we can do to help mitigate the dangers posed by fentanyl use is a good thing,” Horhn told reporters. 
Fitch echoed that message in her address.
“We see that there’s a crisis,” she said as Jackson first responders stood behind her holding boxes of naloxone. “We know what to do because we’re trained on this. We have the resources, the tools and the supplies.”
But neither said they would advocate that the lawsuit funds sent to cities and counties – paid by companies that contributed to the opioid crisis that has killed at least 1,300 Mississippians since the state received its first payment three years ago – be spent to mitigate those same dangers. The state has received over $124 million in lawsuit payments in the past three years, but less than $1 million has been used to address addiction so far. 
Both the state and localities are expected to receive about $300 million more over the next 20 years.
Horhn — whose city has been spending a portion of its more than $500,000 of opioid settlement dollars for fiber optic cable installation, an office move and a shelving system — said he expects future payments to be used for the city’s violence prevention efforts. Chokwe Lumumba, Horhn’s predecessor, was mayor when Jackson spent money for general expenses.
Horhn said he and the city council might use some settlement dollars to prevent more overdoses, but he didn’t make any commitments to that.

“We also realize that we’ve got a serious violence prevention need in our city, and that’s an allowable expense,” he told reporters. “And so right now, that’s where we’re going to put the primary focus.” 
When Mississippi Today asked Fitch if the state has done enough with opioid settlement money to prevent overdoses, Fitch said she was following the Legislature’s instructions and reviewing applications for overdose response projects with the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council. It’s a committee created by state lawmakers this year and chaired by Fitch to recommend how the Legislature should spend most of the state’s opioid settlement dollars. 
“We’re getting people to vet those [applications] so we can make the distributions and the recommendations to the Legislature,” she said. 
Lawmakers then decide which of those applications to accept or reject, and they expect to distribute those dollars in the summer of 2026.

Mississippi Today asked Fitch why Mississippi is the only state in the country to distribute less than $3 million of its opioid settlement funds to address addiction after the conference ended. Her spokesperson, Maryasa Lee, interrupted before Fitch could respond. 
Lee said it was the Mississippi Today reporter’s third question at the event, and the attorney general’s office had already emailed the newsroom a statement about the spending. The statement did not address that question.
Most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement money is overseen by state government leaders, but they’ve only reported using their tens of millions of dollars for lawyers fees so far. The $15.5 million that cities and counties like Jackson have received can be spent on general expenses because Fitch wrote a contract in 2021 that says Mississippi’s local governments – unlike in at least 34 other states – can spend opioid settlement payments for any public purpose. 
Those localities have reported using less than $1 million of that money to address the crisis, a Mississippi Today investigation found.
The lawsuits’ lawyers said that some spending unrelated to addiction is allowed, but they discouraged governments receiving the money from doing that. Most states required all their opioid settlement money to be spent to address addiction, and they’ve all spent more for that purpose than Mississippi — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares. 
Mississippians struggling with opioid addiction face challenges when looking for treatment and recovery resources, even as the state has received these payments. Less than a third of people in the state who have an opioid addiction and use Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program, received effective medication to treat the disease, according to a 2023 study. 
When Mississippi Today showed public health advocates how the state’s cities and counties are  spending their opioid settlement dollars, they were dismayed. Dr. Judith Feinberg, who helped author a guide on how the money could address the public health crisis, called Mississippi’s settlement spending “complete and utter bullshit.”

The conclusion of a nine-month investigation follows a complaint filed by Common Cause Rhode Island last December, alleging that Magee should have registered as a lobbyist for influencing what was supposed to be a competitive state solicitation. The complaint noted Magee’s role in crafting the bidding language to give a leg up to ILO, a newly created firm led by his former colleague, Julia Rafal-Baer. Magee and Rafal-Baer previously worked together at a separate education consulting firm, Chiefs for Change. 
The state ultimately cut short the ILO contract halfway through its one-year term, paying ILO $1.8 million
A yearslong investigation by the Rhode Island State Police and the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General cleared McKee, Magee and Rafal-Baer of criminal charges in October 2024. Investigators found there was not enough proof to prosecute, though Attorney General Peter Neronha denounced McKee for his “hamhandedness” in the affair.
The criminal investigation’s end — and the trove of documents unleashed for public viewing — prompted new questions over state ethics, lobbying and bid-rigging rules, including the allegations from Common Cause that Magee broke state lobbying laws — an offense which, if proven, is punishable by a $5,000 fine. 
Yet Magee, who left McKee’s transition team in 2021 and now serves as president for Minerva University in San Francisco, was exempt from state lobbying registration rules, DiCola wrote.
The 2016 state law governing what qualifies as lobbying activity, and who must register with the state, offers 11 exemptions, including for people who serve on a governmental advisory committee or task force, and for people who respond to a state request for information. Magee met both of those exemptions, DiCola wrote, having served on McKee’s transition team during his ascension to the governor’s seat, and later, as an informal, volunteer adviser and supporter.
“The weight of the evidence established that Mr. Magee was a trusted advisor to Mayor McKee, Lt. Governor McKee, and Governor McKee,” DiCola wrote, citing conclusions by State Police and the AG’s office in their dual investigation. “He has never lost that advisor status at any point in time.”
Even if he had, his email correspondence shows he was involved in a state procurement – exempting him under the second listed criteria in state law, DiCola wrote.
John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, disagreed.
“I think the secretary’s investigation didn’t read the statute correctly,” Marion said in an interview Monday, noting that he was heavily involved in crafting the 2016 law that reformed state lobbying activity.
Marion pointed out that Magee’s interference with the state contract extended beyond the length of his role as an adviser to the governor. 
As for the exemption regarding requests for information, Magee’s involvement was not in an official capacity, but rather “lobbying behind the scenes,” Marion said.
“When we put in the exception for responding to requests for information, we meant submitting through state purchasing, in response to an official RFI,” Marion said. “We didn’t mean a colloquial request for information that could come from anybody through any channel.”
Marion said the conclusion by Amore’s office suggests the state law needs clarifications, and plans to file a petition asking for regulation updates. He was unsure when Common Cause would be ready to submit its request, but hoped to get the changes made before the next set of state general officeholders take their seats following the 2026 elections.
“Transition committees are a real gray area in our state law,” Marion said. “Unlike at the federal level or other states, no laws specifically address transition committees in Rhode Island. There’s an opportunity for a lot of influence that isn’t really tracked.”
Magee, who was also sent a letter with the Secretary of State’s decision on Sept. 18, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Christina Freundlich, a spokesperson for McKee’s reelection campaign, called the controversy “resolved.”
“Any efforts to revive it are a distraction,” Freundlich said in an email Monday. “The governor remains focused on delivering for Rhode Island and standing firm against any attacks from Washington Republicans.”
A separate rule change to state ethics laws governing gifts from lobbyists remains under consideration by the Rhode Island Ethics Commission, following a Sept. 9 public hearing. Also prompted by the fallout from the ILO investigation: a new law passed by the Rhode Island General Assembly on the final day of the 2025 session, explicitly banning public officials and administrators from bid-rigging.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Nearly 2,400 South Carolina drivers received tickets last week for failing to slow down or move over for emergency vehicles parked on the sides of highways, the Department of Public Safety said Monday.
The agency did a five-day ticketing “blitz” Monday through Friday after drivers struck three Highway Patrol troopers in the span of a month, killing one.
Within hours of a news conference Sept. 15 announcing the crackdown, a car hit a Berkeley County sheriff’s deputy on Interstate 26, leaving him with non-fatal injuries. The collisions came soon after the agency warned drivers to stay aware following several near-misses captured on video.
SC Highway Patrol to crack down on unsafe driving after 1 trooper killed, 2 injured

A state law often referred to as the Move Over Law requires drivers passing police, tow trucks, construction crews and other emergency vehicles parked on the side of the highway to “significantly reduce the speed” of their car or switch lanes if possible.
Highway Patrol officers went out in pairs last week, so that one could respond to whatever required the officer to pull off the highway and the other could pursue any drivers who didn’t get out of the way, said Col. Christopher Williamson, commander of the state Highway Patrol.
Highway Patrol officers gave out 1,766 tickets, which cost between $300 and $500, and 554 warnings during the five-day “Operation Keep Us Safe,” according to the department. The State Transport Police, which specializes in monitoring commercial vehicles, distributed 49 tickets. Local police and sheriff’s departments that reported numbers to the state agency wrote the remaining 617 tickets, according to department data.
The state Highway Patrol also issued 152 warnings to drivers for violating the hands-free driving law, which went into effect Sept. 1. Until February, officers will only issue warnings to people caught holding their phones while driving.
Although the official crackdown lasted only a week, Williamson warned last week that drivers should still expect to receive tickets for violating traffic laws, especially when putting others’ lives at risk.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4350-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 16:58:11.574398

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicholas Monsarrat.","Born Dec. 26, 1941
Westport, Connecticut
Died Sept. 11, 2025
Charlotte, Vermont


Nicholas (Nick) Monsarrat of Charlotte, longtime veteran of the Vermont news scene, has died at the age of 83. During his 40-plus year career he worked for all the major newspapers in the state, as a Statehouse reporter, then Editorial Page Editor and subsequently Managing Editor of the Times Argus; Managing Editor of The Rutland Herald; and Editorial Page Editor at the Burlington Free Press. He also appeared regularly on Vermont This Week, helped found VT Digger with originator Anne Galloway and was one of its early Board Members. He is featured in the 2010 Vermont Public Television documentary “Headline Vermont,” which details the history of Vermont Newspapers. He served in the Air Force in the Philippines when he was drafted in the 60s right before Vietnam, writing for the Stars and Stripes, and was an Adjunct Professor of Journalism at St. Michael’s College. In 1983 he co-chaired an unprecedented exchange of Russian and American journalists, who met in both Russia and Vermont. Nick also served on the Board of Directors of the New England Press Association.
Anne Galloway has written glowingly of Nick during Digger’s founding: “I am grateful for the constancy of Nick Monsarrat, my editor. Nick’s advice and editing expertise have been invaluable. He smooths the rough patches in my writing, translates arcane legislative argot, keeps the facts straight….I owe hm a debt of gratitude.”
He will be sorely missed by his wife of 30 years, Barbara Ann Curcio, also a reporter, with whom he partnered in various ventures–both writing and editing one another’s work. He is the cousin of famed novelist Nicholas Monsarrat (“The Cruel Sea”), and later penned two novels of his own–“The Sharpstown Boys” and “United States.” Barbara and Nick also rode together and cared for their total of seven horses in both Vermont and Florida. In between, Nick endured too many health problems to list over the years, starting with a quadruple bypass at the tender age of 51.
Strikingly handsome and always brave, he endured health challenge after challenge with his wife by his side through hospitalizations, surgeries and finally extended stays in rehab facilities, until he was no longer mobile enough to remain at home. Through it all he showed tremendous courage and resilience, battling often grim prognoses to recover time and time again. He died at home on hospice care in the room where he and Barbara were married next to the grand piano three decades ago.
No doubt he was greeted in heaven by four of his horses–Silver the quarter horse and herd leader, Scout the opinionated paint, Jester the faithful Palomino and Red, Pony Club Veteran and sometime-stinker. Also there to meet him were his three dogs–Macbeth and Macduff the Scottish sheep dogs and Truffles, a bearded collie mix. No doubt his parents, John and Margaret Monsarrat were on hand, along with his in-laws Ann and Dominic Curcio.
He will be remembered by all–his memory a blessing. No doubt he will do his best to promulgate Free Speech and Freedom of the Press in heaven and on earth, encouraged by his three remaining horses, Bailey the Irish pony, and Splash and Thunder, the Wild and Crazy Paint horses.

The study, released Monday by MSU’s Education Policy Innovation Collaborative, comes as the Legislature spins its wheels on K-12 and higher education spending for the coming fiscal year, which begins next Tuesday, Oct. 1. Although both the House and the Senate have passed education budgets, their respective bills sit collecting dust in the opposite chamber.
Aside from schools, the whole of government is still without a funding plan because those plans are also sitting dormant in the Legislature as the budget crisis continues.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

Of note, a sticking point has been over how the respective education bills fund schools, with both sides agreeing that funding needs to be increased or maintained at current levels. The Senate’s K-12 budget would retain separate line items for funding in key areas, such as free school meals, while the House’s spending plan would wrap those line items, known as categoricals, into the basic line item of per-pupil funding. The House has said its main argument for doing so is to have the dollars follow students more closely, while the Senate has warned that wrapping those dollars up would allow schools to forgo continuing to offer services like free school meals.
The study also shows Michigan has far fewer students and a student body with greater needs than in the past.
Funding-Michigans-Future_K-12-Historical-Finance-Trends_Sept2025
“Taken together, this picture is one of recovery without full restoration,” the report said in an executive summary section. “In short, Michigan’s schools have been asked to do more with less purchasing power than they had a generation ago. While this pattern has started to reverse in recent years, it remains to be seen whether funding will return to the levels of the early 2000s. As new funding typically takes several years to raise student outcomes, recent increases will need to be sustained, if not enhanced, in the coming years.”
To that point, new data on per-pupil funding shows that, in terms of modern dollars adjusted to inflation, revenues for per-pupil funding rose into the early 2000s, fell for two decades and have begun to recover. 
However, districts face greater restrictions on how they use those dollars now when compared to previous decades, and are now expected to provide more services beyond instruction. Services like universal free meals and student mental health are examples of service areas schools have had to take on outside of basic instruction for students, and funding for those services remains unstable.

Additionally, MSU found that per-pupil spending on basic instruction has, for the most part, been roughly flat in real dollar terms over the last three decades. Spending on support for special populations, consisting of kids with disabilities and academically at-risk students, fell throughout the 2000s before rebounding recently.
The trends all mask the fact that spending on retirement contributions, made mandatory under state law, has increased dramatically, which has reduced the effectiveness of resources made available to classroom instruction areas.
Among recommendations for the state and the Legislature, MSU said the state needs to align its main revenue streams more closely with inflation, improving the system by indexing the state’s education foundation allowance and special populations funding and granting districts greater purchasing power over time.
The university also suggested the Legislature should consider using budget tools to smooth out categorical funding, providing districts with greater flexibility around when they can spend certain types of categorical dollars that expand services or require the hiring of new staff. That would help scale those services and avoid what MSU described as “whiplash” when categorical funding shifts depending on who and what party is running Lansing.
New revenue was also suggested, with MSU noting that as of 2022, Michigan had the fifth lowest tax burden among all states, and the effort to curtail new taxes may be part of the problem when seeking answers as to why the state has seen a decades-long decline in funding. There were a number of options the Legislature could consider in that realm, including leveraging state or local K-12 resources. It’s unclear, however, if the staunchly conservative Republican-controlled House would ever consider raising new revenue without massive cuts to balance them in order to fund schools.
Promoting efficiencies and paying down unfunded retirement liabilities were also recommended.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/classroom-teens-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 16:58:11.574398

Laura Kelly's office said $10.4 million the federal government is threatening to withhold from a food assistance program won't have an immediate effect as the state plans to appeal the decision. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The federal government’s plan to withhold $10 million from a Kansas food assistance program won’t affect recipients and will be delayed while the state files an appeal, the Kansas governor’s chief of staff said Monday.
The governor’s office provided clarity on the issue after Attorney General Kris Kobach declared the state had lost millions in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “Gov. Laura Kelly refused to provide basic information about SNAP recipients to the USDA.”
Kelly’s administration has refused federal demands for SNAP data because it isn’t clear how Kansans’ personal information will be used.
“The governor seems to be blinded by her political ideology. She is flagrantly violating Kansas law, and she is hurting needy Kansans in the process,” Kobach said in a news release. 
Kobach sued Kelly and Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard on Sept. 8 for failing to turn over personal data of SNAP applicants and recipients, as they were repeatedly asked to do by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Patrick Penn, a former Kansas legislator who now is U.S. undersecretary for the Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services program at USDA, in an Aug. 20 letter to Kelly threatened to withhold $10.4 million every three months until his agency receives the data.
Penn said the data is needed to look for fraud within the program, which Howard has previously said is a function already completed through a fraud detection program in place as part of the state’s contract with FNS.
Penn said that is not the case.
“In the absence of data, FNS lacks key information necessary to ensure effective stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” Penn’s letter said. “FNS has already discovered from states that are complying with this statutory data sharing requirement that fraud or duplication in state distribution of federal funds has gone unreported and needs remediation.”
Kelly’s chief of staff, Will Lawrence, said the state will file an appeal of the decision to withhold funding.
“The attorney general continues to have a complicated relationship with the facts and the truth in an effort to score political points by misleading thousands of Kansans,” Lawrence said of Kobach’s press release. 
“We will, of course, appeal the decision and continue to protect the security of Kansans’ private data,” Lawrence said. “The filing of an appeal will automatically stay the disallowance of funds, meaning the SNAP program will continue to operate normally as the appeals process unfolds.”
Howard has said previously that DCF and the state are awaiting the ruling of a lawsuit brought by California and joined by other states asking the courts to stay the USDA’s request for SNAP data. A temporary injunction to stop the release of data to the USDA is in effect, according to a filing in that case.
Kobach’s office has not responded to Kansas Reflector questions about whether he believes that injunction applies to Kansas.
“We warned that this would happen when we filed the lawsuit on behalf of all Kansans against the governor. She is required by Kansas law to provide this basic information to the USDA,” Kobach said in the press release. “Now low-income Kansas families won’t be able to put food on the table because of her political defiance.”
If the funding were lost, it would affect the Kansas budget because it pays for administrative costs associated with SNAP. The funds are not part of the aid that is paid to SNAP recipients. 
U.S. Reps. Ron Estes and Tracey Mann sent a letter, which Kobach included in his press release, to Kelly on Sept. 3 demanding the data be released so the state can correct its SNAP error rate.
Earlier this month, Howard explained the SNAP error rate is determined by the fraud detection process already in place.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/laurakelly6-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 16:58:11.574398

(Photo courtesy of Save the Bay)After seven versions of a shoreline restoration plan failed to pass muster with Rhode Island coastal regulators, Quidnessett Country Club is looking to the courts for relief.
The Sept. 8 complaint filed in Providence County Superior Court declares the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) violated Quidnessett’s constitutional property rights under the Fifth and 14th Amendments by imposing overly restrictive requirements for its shoreline. 
“[Quidnessett] does not seek to increase the size of its property; it wants to preserve the land it has owned and used for decades,” Robin Main, an attorney representing the North Kingstown country club, wrote in the complaint. “Nevertheless, the regulatory requirements imposed by CRMC effectively preclude [Quidnessett] from protecting its land.”
Seeking to buffer its signature golf course against rising sea levels, the club built a 600-foot-long rock wall along the shoreline in the winter of 2023, despite coastal regulations that restrict development in environmentally sensitive areas. A cease and desist order against the club was issued in August 2023, followed by a series of written warnings from state regulators and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Resolution on the rock wall’s removal remains elusive, despite years of behind-the-scenes negotiations, countless email exchanges, public hearings and multiple missed deadlines.
The CRMC is set to discuss and consider additional action against the country club at its Tuesday night meeting, according to the agenda, which also includes a closed door session regarding Quidnessett’s lawsuit against the agency.
Main declined to comment when reached by email Monday.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the CRMC, also declined to comment.
Coastal watchdogs, including Save the Bay, have been calling for state regulators to sanction the 1,000-member country club for two years, accusing the politically appointed panel of “political favoritism” at the expense of public access and coastal protections. 
In January, the CRMC denied an initial request by the country club to seek retroactive permission for the wall. The council’s unanimous vote seemingly ended the debate over the state’s classification of nearby waters and shifted focus to details of how Quidnessett ought to remove the wall and restore the shoreline.
That proved no less challenging, with seven plans submitted by Quidnessett — the most recent sent Sept. 5 — all rejected by coastal staff because they did not meet state coastal requirements. 
“To date, a restoration plan acceptable to staff has not been submitted,” a CRMC staff report from Sept.16 states.
The staff report notes the most recent legal challenge — an initial lawsuit filed by Quidnessett in July centers on procedural concerns with the CRMC review process — as evidence that the country club never intended to comply with state mandated criteria for its shoreline restoration plan.
“Staff conclude that not only did the QCC deliberately, willfully, and knowingly violate CRMC regulations by installing an unauthorized revetment of dumped stone over 600 feet in length, but also does not intend to comply with the Council’s Order to Restore,” the staff report states. “Staff recommend that the Council direct CRMC Legal Counsel to pursue all appropriate enforcement actions to enforce the Order to Restore.”

Much ado about water types
The new lawsuit reprises Quidnessett’s original argument to the CRMC, in which it contended that the existing “Type 1” water classification — denoting environmental conservation areas — was incorrect because there was already residential and commercial development when the Type 1 label was attached to the area in the late 1970s.
Permanent structures are prohibited along all Type 1 shorelines. However, a reclassification to the less-stringent Type 2 waters, as Quidnessett first sought, could potentially allow for permanent structural barriers like a rock wall, or geotextile sandbags.
CRMC staff have maintained that a natural barrier, with a gentle slope and native vegetation, is the only suitable buffer to separate the golf course from Narragansett Bay. But with coastal erosion already consuming valuable shoreline space, the CRMC requirements would also force Quidnessett to cut into the adjacent 14th hole of its golf course, according to the lawsuit. 
The alternative?
“If left unchecked, the erosion will collapse the Course’s 14th hole into the sea and continue to take large portions of the Course,” the petition states. “QCC cannot move the 14th hole of the Course. There is no extra land to relocate the hole, and the loss of the 14th hole would destroy the Course.”
The petition asks a judge to declare the CRMC’s water type designation unconstitutional under the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which protects against the “taking” of private property and ensures a right to due process. The same legal arguments featured heavily in local private property owners’ challenges to the 2023 state shoreline access law. 
“It’s not uncommon for private property owners to assert these kinds of property rights claims in the face of state regulatory regimes,” said Sean Lyness, an assistant professor for the University of Massachusetts School of Law. Lyness previously worked as a special assistant attorney general in Rhode Island. 
But much like failed lawsuits in other states, Lyness didn’t think Quidnessett’s legal claims would hold water.
“The Takings Clause has expressly carved out background principles,” Lyness said. “Private property owners are allowed to do a lot with their private property, but they’re not allowed to do anything they want.”
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, called Quidnessett’s lawsuit “kind of ridiculous.” Thorp pointed out that the country club never administratively appealed the CRMC decision rejecting a change to water type designation administratively before turning to the courts.
“I still don’t know what the heck is going to happen tomorrow night,” Thorp said of the CRMC meeting. “What I hope happens is the council gives a very clear order ordering the wall to come down and the site to be restored. What I hope doesn’t happen is that the whole thing is put on hold while this lawsuit plays out.”

(Courtesy NPS)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials suspect a hemorrhagic disease is the culprit behind several dozen white-tailed deer deaths in northwest Montana, and the department is also following reports of localized outbreaks in deer and antelope in the southeast part of the state.
The department received reports of roughly two dozen dead deer near Eureka and a dozen near Plains. In a press release, FWP officials say that while lab testing has not yet confirmed the viral disease, the outbreak’s timing makes it suspect to one of two common types of hemorrhagic disease.
Both forms of the viral disease — epizootic hemorrhagic disease and blue tongue — are transmitted by biting midges. They primarily affect white-tailed deer, but mule deer and other species, including antelope, can be impacted.
In the southeastern part of the state, FWP official are also receiving reports of localized EHD and blue tongue virus in white-tailed deer and antelope along the Yellowstone River corridor and in prairie habitats. These cases have also not yet been confirmed by lab testing.
The disease is not spread between deer, and there is no known risk to humans.
FWP officials advise hunters that eating meat from animals that appear healthy when harvested is safe when properly cooked. However, hunters should avoid harvesting or consuming animals that appear sick.
Animals with EHD or BTV can appear weak, lethargic and disoriented. They are often found near water sources due to high fever and may drool or foam at the mouth. They can exhibit swelling of the head, neck, tongue and lips, as well as mouth sores. The tongue may appear blue. EHD and BTV are typically fatal, but some deer and antelope survive and develop immunity.
The disease can cause significant losses in localized deer populations, but outbreaks are usually short-lived and confined to certain areas, according to FWP. Hunters around the Yellowstone River are advised that deer densities may be lower than normal due to the localized effects of the disease.
Hunters in Region 7 are asked to help FWP monitor this outbreak by reporting sick and dead deer and antelope to the wildlife manager, Brett Dorak, at brett.dorak@mt.gov.
FWP officials in northwest Montana said it is not necessary for the public to report additional dead deer suspected of dying from hemorrhagic disease.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/46603092555_1e3ad36e6d_k-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-22 15:58:13.683122

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Minnesota Capitol has no security checkpoints or metal detectors and allows guns on its premises, making it an outlier among state houses for its relatively lax security.
Those findings were presented to the Advisory Committee on Capitol Security Monday by the National Conference of State Legislatures, whose researchers delved into capitol security procedures around the country.
State capitol security tends to vary widely; Minnesota elected officials are grappling with ensuring the public can still easily access “the people’s house,” while ensuring everyone’s safety.
Security at the Capitol is top of mind for many state lawmakers and officials who work at the Capitol Complex after the June assassinations of Melissa and Mark Hortman and the shootings of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, as well as the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
“It is a shared value of making sure that people have access to their Capitol, access to their elected officials, and that the people who serve in these bodies feel safe to do so and that the public feel safe to be here and to interact with us,” said Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who chairs the advisory committee.
The NCSL gathered data from 38 states, and it found that 30 states have metal detectors and conduct bag searches. Eight states conduct no screenings at entrances. Minnesota has no metal detectors and doesn’t conduct bag screenings.
The security measures have little to do with the partisan make up of the state legislatures, according to The Council of State Governments. Red states like Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Texas and the Dakotas all have metal detectors.
At least 25 of the 38 states that were surveyed prohibit members of the public from carrying firearms, according to the NCSL. Minnesota Republicans, who are closely aligned with the gun rights movement, have been clear they will oppose restrictions on their right to carry.
The advisory committee will meet a few more times this year to create recommendations for the Legislature to take up once it reconvenes for its 2026 legislative session in February. 
Any solution will need to be bipartisan, given that Republicans and Democrats share control of the Minnesota House and Democrats control the Senate by just a single vote.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250507_0817-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-22 15:58:13.683122

(Screen shot from Iowa PBS livestream)Iowa Department of Health and Human Services Director Kelly Garcia has resigned, the governor’s office announced Monday.
Director of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing (DIAL) Larry Johnson will succeed her in leading the department.
Garcia served as head of the department for six years after Gov. Kim Reynolds appointed her to head the then-Department of Human Services in 2019. Garcia took on the role of interim director of the Iowa Department of Public Health in June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the two departments were officially merged in 2022 under her leadership.
“Serving as the inaugural Director of Iowa’s Department of Health and Human Services has been a profound privilege,” Garcia said in the news release announcing her resignation. “I’m deeply proud of our work to support Iowa’s families, from strengthening child protective services to improving health care access, especially for Iowa’s most vulnerable. I’m thankful to Governor Reynolds for this tremendous opportunity and to the incredible HHS team for their tireless dedication to our state.”
In addition to managing the state’s response during the COVID-19 pandemic, Garcia also played a role in initiatives led by Reynolds on issues like restructuring the state’s behavioral health system and pursuing expansions for Iowa’s medical residencies programs.
Reynolds thanked Garcia in a statement for serving in her administration, saying she made major improvements to the state’s public health and human services infrastructure.
“Since her arrival in Iowa, Director Garcia has led with vision and dedication, driving transformative progress within Iowa’s health and human services systems,” Reynolds said. “Her leadership at HHS has delivered meaningful results for Iowans across our state. From expanding child care opportunities to enhancing health care access in rural communities, her contributions will make a difference for years to come.”
Garcia has not stated where she plans to work next. Her resignation comes as Reynolds has announced she will not seek reelection in 2026. Whoever is elected governor in the upcoming election will have the ability to replace the agency directors appointed by Reynolds.
While Garcia has resigned, she is still working with Johnson, beginning a “weeks-long transition plan, which will include engaging with HHS division leaders, staff, and key stakeholders across the state” according to the news release. Johnson is set to begin his time as HHS director in mid-October.
In addition to serving as DIAL director for six years, Johnson has also served as the state public defender, and as legal counsel for former Gov. Terry Branstad and then-Lt. Gov. Reynolds.
“Director Johnson’s successful leadership of Iowa’s largest regulatory agency has prepared him well for the responsibility of leading the Department of Health and Human Services,” Reynolds said. “A trusted leader known for achieving high performance, Larry will guide the HHS team through full implementation of the agency’s work in progress as we continue to elevate our service to Iowans.”
Aaron Baack, who currently serves as deputy director and chief operations officer at the agency, will replace Johnson as interim director.
Johnson thanked the staff at DIAL for their work during his time at the agency, and said he was looking forward to taking on the HHS leadership role.
“Through alignment, our goal at DIAL was to modernize, standardize and simplify government,” Johnson said. “We accomplished extraordinary results in a short period of time, and I look forward to seeing that work continue and grow.  I am honored, humbled and excited to work with the talented team at HHS and grateful for the past six years at DIAL.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KG.jpg,,,2025-09-22 15:58:13.683122
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-22 19:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,There will be no Mohegan casino in Manhattan as locals reject proposals,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/22/manhattan-casino-mohegan-rejected/,"The 6-acre project, dubbed “Freedom Plaza” and operated by CT's Mohegan gaming company, was denied by a community advisory committee","NEW YORK (AP) — Plans to build the Big Apple’s first full-service casino in the heart of the city have run out of luck.
A local panel on Monday rejected the last of three Manhattan proposals that had been among those vying for a new state license to operate a Las Vegas-style casino in the lucrative New York City market.
The proposal — a six-acre project near the United Nations headquarters dubbed “Freedom Plaza” and operated by Mohegan, the gaming company run by Connecticut’s Mohegan Tribe — was denied by a state-commissioned community advisory committee on a 4-2 vote.
A Jay-Z-backed plan to build a Caesars Palace casino in Times Square and another proposal for a gambling resort on Manhattan’s West Side in the Hudson Yards area were both voted down by two other local boards last week amid local opposition.
As in those votes, committee members in Monday’s decision appointed by Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams were in favor of the Freedom Plaza project, but panel members representing local lawmakers said no.
The local politicians, all Democrats like Hochul and Adams, said in a statement that residents voiced concerns during public hearings about the development’s impact on congestion and public safety in the area.
Michael Hershman, CEO of the Soloviev Group, which was the lead developer on the more than $11 billion project, said in a statement after the vote that Manhattan — the “undisputed capital of the world” — deserved the resort, which “would have attracted visitors while serving the needs of its community.”
Ray Pineault, CEO of Mohegan, argued the review process “did not allow for a recognition of the impact we could have had on the broader community of New York and the many individuals who would have benefited from new jobs, housing, and community benefits.”
Five proposals still remain in the race for up to three gaming licenses.
Among them is a proposed Bally’s casino on a Bronx public golf course once run by President Donald Trump’s company, a gambling hall envisioned for Coney Island’s iconic boardwalk in Brooklyn, and a Hard Rock casino proposed next to Citi Field in Queens, where the New York Mets play.
Two “racinos” — slot parlors built alongside horse racing tracks — that are already located in Yonkers and in Queens are also seeking a license to become full-fledged casinos with live table games such as blackjack and poker.
Local board approval is required for proposals to advance to the next stage in the competition. State gambling regulators expect to make their final decision in December.
Adams, who is running for reelection as an independent, expressed surprise at the demise of the some of the more high profile projects that had been in the running.
“Casinos can bring jobs. It can bring stability, tourism,” he said in a television interview ahead of Monday’s vote. “So, I was surprised at some of the negative votes. Let the final process make the decision. We should not be stopping them at this local level.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25265583788216-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 15:58:13.683122

Ned Lamont's text messages leading up to his veto of HB 5002.,"Some Democratic lawmakers quietly urged Governor Ned Lamont to sign an omnibus housing bill this session — even, in some cases, when they had just voted against it themselves.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Ginny Monk to discuss her article, “Political challenges of CT HB 5002 depicted in Ned Lamont’s texts,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short.
WSHU: Hello, Ginny. HB 5002, Connecticut’s controversial housing bill, passed by the legislature this year, was quite contentious. However, it appeared Governor Lamont supported the bill until he vetoed it. Is that why you decided to request his text messages for the days leading up to the veto?
GM: That is why I decided to FOI his text messages. His staff had been working on the bill, and it was really a surprise to a lot of lawmakers and a lot of folks who had just been tuned into the housing conversation when he started talking about a veto in June.
WSHU: Were you surprised by what the text messages revealed?
GM: I wouldn’t say I was surprised by everything. Certainly, there were some that I didn’t expect. You know, I didn’t know who the governor was reaching out to for advice on the matter. I was interested to see the way in which his staff discussed the opposition and the kind of open conversation between him and his wife about him running for a third term.
WSHU: So it seemed as if his decision of whether or not to run for a third term had a lot to do with his thinking at the time. As a matter of fact, some of the lawmakers who texted him at that time mentioned the third term and whether this would be good or not. What would they say?
GM: Yeah, so certainly it was part of a conversation. His wife, Annie Lamont, emailed him and said, This is what a third term looks like. Some things are going to be difficult. He was being urged by some local politicians and folks involved in politics in Fairfield County to run for a third term. I will say that the governor’s office, in their statement to me, denied that the decision had anything to do with elections or politics, that it was a policy decision.
WSHU: However, Fairfield County towns were vehemently opposed to this bill, and the lawmakers from Fairfield County towns, a lot of them supported the bill but voted against it, while others knew that they had pushback from their constituents but still voted for the bill. Could you just tell us a little bit about how the text messages revealed how different lawmakers ended up where they did on this bill?
GM: Yeah, so I think, you know, you can kind of put them into a few buckets based on the text messages. There were some who were against the bill, voted against it, and said, these are the reasons. There were some who voted against the bill, and then they discussed supporting or texting the governor about how they’d like to see him sign it. And in my conversations with lawmakers, you know, they kind of pointed out there are things that they might believe personally, but it doesn’t work for their district politically, or their constituents feel differently. So they don’t necessarily vote how they feel. They vote how they think their constituents want to see them vote.
WSHU: The most interesting were the ones who actually voted against the bill and then were lobbying Lamont to sign the bill,
GM: Yeah, it is interesting to see what’s behind the scenes there. And you know, a few lawmakers kind of talked about when you might know a bill is going to pass, but you need the political cover. There are all kinds of reasons people vote for and against the bill, and sometimes they’re not policy reasons.
WSHU: Now, some of Lamont’s strongest supporters were very disappointed, and they felt they had an agreement going into this and that Lamont reneged. How could they trust him going forward? Could you just explain that dynamic a little bit?
GM: Yeah, so I you know, when a bill gets before the governor’s office, it is certainly not the first time the governor’s office is hearing about the bill. In the case of 5002, there were staff from the governor’s office, including his chief of staff, who were working with lawmakers, negotiating with them. And you know, even in the final days of the session, I asked his spokesperson, Rob Blanchard, whether the governor planned to sign, and he said yes. So I think you can conclude from all of those things that the governor did have a deal with lawmakers. And then in his post-session press conference, he wavered a little bit in his support. He said he wished he had seen the bill earlier, which I think a lot of lawmakers were really surprised to hear in their minds. You know, his staff and his office have been very involved.
WSHU: We have a special session coming up, and this is the main issue that they’ll be dealing with. Is there a way to salvage the situation, and how do you think it’s going to play out in a special session? Because there were certain issues. For instance, Lamont is concerned that he says the local communities should lead the way. I don’t know what that really means, but then there’s an issue with parking, reducing the number of parking spaces for multi-family housing. So could you just talk about that and what you think will happen in this special session?
GM: Yeah, so you’re kind of there on the two issues that Lamont has said he’s concerned about. One was a measure that divided up the housing need amongst the towns in the state, which told them they needed to plan and zone for this number of units, so we would assign them a number of units. The other was to remove off-street minimum parking requirements for some smaller apartment buildings, with the idea being that it makes it easier to build more housing cheaply, and you can fit it in more places. So those were really the two big issues that towns had, and Lamont said he wanted to work on them. It sounds like he had some sort of compromise. I don’t know what that will look like with those two measures, whether it’ll mean they’re watered down, cut out, or if there’s some easy technical language changes that would make the governor happy. But yeah, it sounds like we’re looking at a special session sometime next month.
WSHU: And bottom line, Connecticut has a housing crisis. Do you think that at the end of the day, we’re going to make progress in trying to deal with our housing crisis?
GM: It’s interesting that you use the word progress. That’s something that House Majority Leader Jason Rojas has talked about a lot: how past bills have sort of been painfully incremental. Process is the phrase he uses. And I think the big question is, 5002, I think, didn’t feel so incremental. It felt big. And will this new bill be just painfully incremental again.
WSHU: Wow. Well, thank you so much. Ginny. Really appreciate you doing this, and great to get a behind-the-scenes look at what the political negotiations are on these bills.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2277-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 17:57:09.317385

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)The United States Department of Justice on Friday announced that it had filed a statement of interest in Enbridge Energy’s case against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. 
Whitmer pledged to shut down the Canadian energy company’s Line 5 pipeline as part of her 2018 campaign for governor.
In 2020, she ordered the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to revoke Enbridge’s permit to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, arguing the company had repeatedly violated the terms of the easement and that its continued operation within the Great Lakes carried an “unacceptable risk” for a catastrophic oil spill. 
In response, Enbridge filed a suit arguing the governor and the DNR hold no authority over pipeline safety, and that the move to shut down the pipeline was in violation of the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty with Canada concerning the flow of oil and natural gas through pipelines across borders. 
Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division raised similar arguments in a statement released Friday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation’s statutory authority,” Gustafson said. “President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.”
In response to a recent motion from Enbridge, attorneys for Whitmer and DNR Director Scott Bowen argued the decision to revoke the company’s easement did not fall under the scope of the federal Pipeline Safety Act and the state’s actions are within the limits of the treaty. 
“Our office does not agree with the legal arguments articulated in this amicus brief,” said Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Attorney General, which is representing Whitmer and Bowen in the case. 
The attorney general’s office will respond to the Department of Justice in further detail, Wimmer said, with the state’s response due by Oct. 10.

Ørsted is co-developer of the Revolution Wind Farm off the Rhode Island coast. (Ørsted photo)Construction on the Revolution Wind offshore wind project off the coast of Rhode Island can resume, a federal judge in Washington D.C. ruled Monday.
Senior Judge Royce Lamberth granted the project developers’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Aug. 22 decision to abruptly halt construction of the 65-turbine project was “the height of arbitrary and capricious actions” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns.
“The Bureau does not point to any factual findings that lead them to believe Revolution Wind is implicated in either of these concerns or that those concerns rise to such a level that warrant work cease immediately,” Lamberth, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, said.
Monday’s ruling now means that work on the $5 billion project already 80% completed is expected to resume “as soon as possible” as the lawsuit progresses, according to a statement issued by Ørsted.
“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” the statement read.
Lamberth’s decision came after a 90-minute hearing that was supposed to be accessible to the public via phone. But audio for the call cut out a little over two minutes into the hearing, just as Revolution Wind attorney Janice M. Schneider was making her opening argument.
“Following no process under statute or regulations, the government changed its position and suspended work on a previously-approved project at a critical stage of construction with no notice, no allegation of violation, no meaningful explanation, no consideration of Revolution Wind’s reliance interest, and no due process whatsoever,” Schneider said at around 11:09 a.m.
Lisa J. Klem, special assistant to the Chief Judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, acknowledged at 11:30 a.m. there was an “issue” with the audio and asked the court’s IT team to fix it without interrupting proceedings.
Audio resumed after 12:30 p.m., when Lamberth announced his decision finding that Revolution Wind is suffering “irreparable harm” as a result of the stoppage.
Danish developer Ørsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration. Attorneys general for Rhode Island and Connecticut filed a similar lawsuit in federal court in Providence pointed at the Trump administration to restart construction — a case the federal government is asking be consolidated with the Revolution Wind lawsuit in D.C.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in a statement said he believes Lamberth’s ruling will bode well for his case, which as of Monday has yet to be scheduled to go before Judge Mary S. McElroy.
“Today’s legal victory in Washington, D.C. reaffirms what we know to be true: this President cannot cancel clean energy projects just because he believes doing so is politically expedient for him,” Neronha said.
In court filings, the developers noted they were losing $2 million a day on work and equipment contracts. Lamberth warned that further delays could allow Rhode Island and Connecticut to terminate their power purchase agreements with the company.
“If Revolution Wind cannot meet benchmark deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse,” Lamberth said.

(Photo provided by National Park Service)In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency released a historic Endangerment Finding, which concluded that six greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution and endanger public health and well-being. This pollution is one of the key drivers of climate change, which can also result in more intense storms, increased drought and wildfires, and risks to human life.
The endangerment finding was reaffirmed in 2016, when the EPA finalized the rule for aircraft, stating that greenhouse gases from a variety of aircraft engines cause or contribute to air pollution that endanger public health and welfare. When these findings were released, it served as the legal and scientific basis for the EPA to issue regulations around emissions and other important health protections.  
On March 12, 2025, the Trump administration made a significant and divisive announcement regarding the endangerment finding: the EPA would be starting a formal reconsideration and potential repeal of the 2016 finding. When this announcement was made, the details were drowned out or under-reported by news media, which has led to a lack of understanding by many Americans and communities of its consequences. 
For Alaskans, the repeal of the endangerment finding will have vastly negative consequences. Without the regulation of pollutants contributing to climate change, Alaska will likely see an increase of intensity in coastal storms and wildfires. Famous storms, like Typhoon Merbok, and other severe weather events in Alaska serve as stark reminders of the devastating impacts of climate change. In a state where 82% of our communities can only be reached either by plane or boat, an increase in powerful storms puts our most vulnerable populations, including Alaskan Native communities, in danger.
If the EPA does proceed to roll back the endangerment finding, we will likely see a sharp decrease in regulations and legal protections, like the Clean Air Act, that protect the health of average Americans. If these protections are repealed, we could see a dramatic rise in adverse health outcomes. Currently, there are approximately 266 million people in the U.S. (8.2 percent of the population) who have asthma, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
There are around 60,000 Alaskans who suffer from asthma, which is the leading cause of school absenteeism and childhood emergency room visits, and is the fourth leading cause of work loss in adults. In 2021, eleven Alaskans died from complications due to asthma. Without regulations to ensure the air we breathe is pollutant-free, we are risking our families’ health.  
Alaskans have the opportunity to submit public comments to the EPA on the endangerment finding through September 22.
Whether a Democrat, a Republican – the health of this planet and your communities should be one of the most critical issues. We all deserve a home where we breathe clean air and drink clean water. The scientific community is standing against the repeal, and the evidence is clear and abundant regarding the findings. If the EPA moves forward with this plan, it will put the health of all Alaskans and Americans in jeopardy.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image2-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 14:58:18.252916

Over the last couple of decades, few if any American economists have played a more prominent role in the national debate over the economy or in actually crafting economic policy than Jared Bernstein. Bernstein served as chair of the national Council of Economic Advisers under President Biden and is currently a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a Distinguished Policy Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.
And recently Bernstein was kind enough to join NC Newsline for a conversation about the current state of the U.S. economy and, among many other things, how the ongoing rise in inflation combined with growth in unemployment signals the arrival of the dreaded phenomenon known as stagflation, and how President Trump’s chaotic policies – most notably the imposition of tariffs on imported goods and services – are fueling what could well be a very destructive and hard-to-reverse economic trend.

Snowpack decline in the Northeast stresses trees and can reduce their ability to sequester carbon, Templer said. (Photo by Emerson Conrad-Rooney/Templer Lab)New England residents know that snow is disappearing from our landscape, and scientists have proven that climate change is to blame. But the effects of snowpack decline go far beyond what’s visible, and researchers working in the forests of New Hampshire and the Northeast are learning more about just how far the phenomenon stretches across seasons and landscapes. Their findings reveal how much tracking snow can tell us about the health of our forests and our world, and what is still to learn.
The average amount of snow that accumulates on the ground throughout the winter season, or snowpack, is shrinking from year to year across the Northeast. While data has captured that effect (and linked it to human-caused climate change), many who live and recreate in the region have noticed it in their own lives — including the researchers who later took up the matter in their work.
“I grew up cross-country skiing with my family,” said Emerson Conrad-Rooney, a doctoral student at Boston University whose work focuses on the effects of climate change on northern forests. Conrad-Rooney, who grew up in western Massachusetts, said the places they had grown up skiing through the winter were, in recent years, open only a handful of days all season long. “That’s been kind of separate from this research I’m doing, but just something that me and my family have seen … We’re, I think, definitely feeling that change,” they said.
Eric Kelsey, a meteorologist and researcher at Plymouth State University, also grew up an enthusiastic winter recreator in Nashua. A love of snow and weather led Kelsey to learn more about the integral role of snowpack to the water cycle. But as he read more, Kelsey was struck by the relative lack of cohesive, long-term snowpack data, especially compared to other weather datasets tracking things like daily high and low temperatures and rainfall.
“We just don’t have a climatology of snowpack — that was surprising to me,” Kelsey said.
The problem, Kelsey said, was not necessarily a lack of data. For more than a century, people across the Northeast have logged information about snowfall, from dam operators attempting to predict how snowmelt would affect their rivers to farmers and ski slope proprietors.

Most tracked snow depth and snow water equivalent (the amount of water contained in that snow, a measure that fluctuates with snow density). Their observations, taken as a whole, are a rich collection of information about snowfall in New England, Kelsey said. But the records were also scattered and disparate, making it difficult for scientists to unlock the information they contained.
Now, Kelsey and Plymouth State graduate student David Zywiczynski are halfway through a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant-funded effort to unify and clean that data, which includes measurements taken over yearslong periods from more than 400 sites. Then, they hope, scientists will be able to use it to make sense of long-term patterns in local snowpack, from general decline to years of snow drought — or abnormally low snowfall conditions.
Because snowpack plays an important role in replenishing streams, lakes, and aquifers when it melts each spring, a tool to identify snow drought with more certainty could help forecasters anticipate the dry conditions that will likely persist later in the year, Kelsey said. The “snow drought index” Kelsey and Zywiczynski are working on to facilitate that may be the first tool of its kind in the nation.
As historic data is put to work at Plymouth State, elsewhere in New Hampshire, scientists are tracking ongoing changes in forests as they unfold.
Just beneath Mount Washington in Pinkham Notch, Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray oversees the collection of daily snowpack depth and snow water equivalent measurements. Data collected in the notch and above at the Mount Washington Observatory stretches back to the 1930s, Murray said, constituting one of the longer sets of continuous snowpack observations available in the region.
Measurements from the two relatively close sites are often very different on the same day, highlighting how difficult it can be to assess snowpack, Murray said. Unlike rain, snow blows around once it falls, clearing off some areas completely and piling up in others. Having data from as many sites as possible is desirable for a more comprehensive understanding, Murray said, so she also works to encourage citizen scientists to measure and submit snowpack data across the region through a smartphone app.
“It’s complex with snowpack, because you have, you know, nooks and crannies across the mountain, and so you have so many ways that snow is distributed differently. Having citizen science data fill in the gaps is something we really value in the mountain ecosystem, where we can’t be everywhere,” Murray said.
Citizen science data also helps keep track of the downstream effects of snowpack decline, including its impact on plant life. Plants rely on natural cues to time their life cycles; when some cues, like the presence of snow, change while others, like day length, do not, they may be negatively impacted, Murray said.
“In climate change, there can be these mismatches of synchronicity,” she said.
Furthermore, as snow melts in spring, the water it releases carries nutrients through the soil, making them more available to the roots of hungry and thirsty young plants. But data shows that the timing of snow melt is changing, too, starting earlier and lasting for longer. Murray hopes citizen data will help shine a light on what that could mean for White Mountain plants, from delicate spring ephemeral wildflowers to alpine trees.
“The snowmelt timing has a strong impact in the spring, and can have a ripple effect over the growing season,” she said.
Understanding those and other ripple effects of snowpack decline is crucial to making informed predictions about what the future might bring for New England, researchers said.
Pamela Templer, chair of the Biology department at Boston University and a researcher who has studied northern forests for more than two decades, established a set of three research plots at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in the White Mountains, about 10 years ago. The goal of the study, entitled “Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment,” or CCASE, was to assess how seasonal changes play off each other in yearly cycles.
Before that study, researchers had shown that in summer, temperate forests experienced some positive effects from growing seasons that were stretching longer, Templer said. Separate studies, including in Templer’s own work, had revealed the negative impacts on temperate forests from warming winters. But Templer wanted to assess those two phenomena together.
“We didn’t know at that point what the net effect of those two changes in climate were on the forest,” Templer said.

To do so, Templer and her team — including Conrad-Rooney and “a village” of other researchers — simulated the freeze-thaw cycle, which can occur in the forest floor when it is not protected by an insulating layer of snow, by removing snow in some plots and heating the ground before allowing it to re-freeze. Precise measurements of the trees within the plot, taken over the 10 years the study has run so far, tracked the forest’s growth and the amount of carbon it was storing away over that period.
The work is a demonstration of one of the many ways snowpack decline can add stress into an ecosystem, said Kelsey, who was not involved in the study.
To a tree, damage from repeated freezing and thawing “is, you know, like getting a cut on your finger,” Kelsey said. “It hurts, it will take some resources from your body to heal it, that could be doing other things… And as we know, if there’s too many stressors on a tree, it will die. So this is just adding another stressor to the trees. That’s not good.”
Ultimately, Templer, Conrad-Rooney, and researcher Andrew Reinmann concluded in a study published this July that the benefits to trees from longer growing seasons were outweighed by the damage those trees suffered from repeated freeze-thaw cycles in the winter. That finding, they said, reveals that previous models projecting forests’ role in helping sequester carbon may have overestimated their role in absorbing greenhouse gas.
“If we think that forests are actually storing more carbon than is actually happening, then that means that, maybe, more carbon would be going into our atmosphere than we realize,” Conrad-Rooney said.
This realization has implications for scientists’ ability to model ecosystem changes into the future. It could also inform land conservation decisions, Templer said.
“We need an accurate accounting,” she said. “If we’re going to use forests as nature-based solutions to climate change in terms of sequestering carbon, then we need to know how much they’re sequestering.”
Researchers expect that as they continue to examine historic and current snowpack data, more effects and ripples of snowpack decline will emerge.
From its role in keeping lakes cool through the summer to protecting the landscape from wildfire, snow impacts the water cycle all year long, Kelsey said. And – as is evident both in the origin of the field’s data and its implications – the study of snow brings together many interests, including those of industry, agriculture, tourism, homeowners with wells, and more.
“It touches our lives in so many ways,” Murray said. “… We hope that people see the science that we’re doing, so that they can understand what’s happening, and how it links to their lives and the outdoors.”

The Trump administration was ordered by a federal judge on Monday to cancel a stop-work order against Revolution Wind, Connecticut’s nearly completed wind farm off the state pier in New London.
The ruling came nearly one month after the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management suddenly halted all offshore work on the project, which was already 80% completed, in a letter citing unspecified national security concerns. 
The project’s developers, which include the Danish energy company Ørsted, sued to overturn the order in federal court in Washington, D.C. 
During a hearing in that case on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the government had provided no new information that could justify its stop-work order, which he called “the height of arbitrary and capacious action.”
In addition, Lamberth cited testimony from Ørsted officials who said the company was losing over $2 million each day the project was halted, and that critical deadlines were nearing to resume work in order to begin supplying electricity by the end of 2026.
“If Revolution Wind cannot meet its deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse,” Lamberth, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, said. “There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm,” he added.
Officials at BOEM and the Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the judge’s decision Monday.
In a statement Monday, Revolution Wind spokeswoman Meaghan Wims said that work on the project will resume “as soon as possible.” 
“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” of the underlying lawsuit, she said. 
Lamberth said his order would allow work to resume at Revolution Wind while the federal government conducts any additional reviews necessary to back up their claims of national security concerns.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-108-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 14:58:18.252916

The vehicle owner is Comanche County school board president Kelly Herd, a member of the board since 2016. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Comanche County law enforcement officials Monday asked for the public’s help investigating an incident in which 10 bullets were fired into the unoccupied, parked vehicle of the local school board president.
President Kelly Herd, and other members of the school board in southwest Kansas, have been embroiled in controversy that led to the suspension of superintendent Ty Theurer pending an inquiry into allegations he sexually harassed and inappropriately touched a student.
The student’s family filed a sexual harassment complaint and police report in the spring, but Herd worked for months to downplay substance of the allegations and to preserve Theurer’s administrative position.
The school board voted Sept. 3 to suspend Theurer with pay after more than 100 community members packed a school board meeting to demand disciplinary action. Many in the audience loudly criticized the board’s handling of the students’ complaint. There was a law enforcement presence at that meeting, but outrage was confined to a series of outbursts by people in the crowd and by Herd.
At 8:30 p.m. Sunday night, the sheriff’s department said, a vehicle parked at a residence in the 500 block of East Cottonwood in Coldwater was struck by gunfire approximately 10 times. Herd has resided at a house in that block for decades.
Sheriff Jacob Bruckner confirmed the vehicle was owned by a USD 300 school board member. He said the Kansas Bureau of Investigation responded to help process the crime scene and assist with the investigation.
“The vehicle was unoccupied at the time and no injuries were reported,” Bruckner said. “The investigation is ongoing.”
In a social media post, the sheriff urged Coldwater residents to check home security systems for video of vehicles or people in the neighborhood around the time of the shooting.
Steve Prusa, a member of Comanche County’s school board, said he was notified of the incident at the board president’s home shortly after it occurred.
The reality of someone turning to firearms to make a point about leadership of a public school district was alarming, he said.
“It’s not just a vandalism,” Prusa said. “It’s definitely to a different level.”
He said members of the school board, who don’t receive a salary, had stepped forward to serve because they sought to be of benefit to the community and assume a role in the education of students. The Comanche County district enrolls about 300 students.
“I am devastated and heartbroken for our community. Violence cannot be an answer to anything,” Prusa said.
Comanche County school board member Dean Yoder said it was wrong to interject violence into debate about education.
“So glad her and her family are OK,” Yoder said. “There is never a need for violence. Ever.”

American Forests, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, announced Franz’s hiring last week. She confirmed Friday that she has no plans to run for higher office. 
“My focus now is on American Forests and working with our amazing team to achieve the audacious goals we have of conserving and restoring America’s forests,” Franz said in an email. 
Franz will start her new role on Sept. 30. Washington state will still be her home base, she said, though she will be traveling frequently to Washington D.C. and other American Forests sites around the country. 
Franz served as Washington’s commissioner of public lands from January 2017 to January 2025. In 2023, she began to run for governor, then dropped out of that race and vied unsuccessfully last year for an open U.S. House seat in western Washington’s 6th Congressional District.
After then-president and CEO of American Forests, Jad Daley, announced in May that he would step down on Sept. 30 at the end of his term, the search team hired by American Forests reached out to Franz and encouraged her to apply for the position.  
American Forests is based in Washington, D.C. The group’s mission of driving forest conservation and restoration, climate change mitigation and community resilience matches the values that guided Franz’s public service, she said. 
“For me, it’s about carrying forward the fight for healthy forests and healthy communities, but with a bigger canvas and more tools to create lasting impact,” Franz said. 
Working at a nonprofit like American Forests, Franz said, allows her to focus on mobilizing government agencies at the local, state and federal level, along with corporate partners and communities nationwide to accelerate forest conservation and restoration. 
“Like Washington state, as a country, we are at a moment of inflection where we must decide if we are going to save our forests or let them disappear,” she said. 
American Forests cited Franz’s work as public lands commissioner, including the development of several state programs related to wildfire response and forest resiliency, as reasons why she was selected to lead the organization. 
“She’s a collaborator and a team builder, and there’s no one who works harder, smarter or with more passion in driving change and progress,” Daley said of Franz.
Franz was the recipient of the organization’s first Forest Resilience Champion Award in 2019 for work on the state’s 20-year Forest Health Strategic Plan, and partnered with American Forests as public land commissioner to launch the Washington Tree Equity Collaborative in 2023.
In July, a former Department of Natural Resources employee sued Franz and the agency, arguing that Franz mishandled abuse allegations that the employee made against the department’s former top lawyer.

The rapid rise of this remarkable technology is reshaping our world in many important ways – some that provide grounds for great hope and others that give rise to profound concerns.
Not surprisingly, AI’s rapid rise is also spurring discussion of a raft of ethical and public policy issues – from questions of privacy and consumer protection to the need to regulate so-called deepfakes, to the very question of how humans assure that they retain control over the technology. Thankfully, some smart leaders have begun to pay close attention to the policy implications of AI, and here in North Carolina, one of those leaders is Mecklenburg County State Senator DeAndrea Salvador. And recently Sen. Salvador joined NC Newsline for a special two-part conversation in which we discussed some of these issues, and how for her, AI is a deeply personal matter.
In Part One of our extended conversation with State Senator Salvador of Mecklenburg County, we dove into a discussion of AI – artificial intelligence – the hopes and fears to which it’s giving rise and, in Senator Salvador’s case, how AI allowed an online talk she had given a few years’ back to be excerpted and manipulated for use in corporate advertising without her consent.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of the important policy implications of AI’s rapid rise, some of the legislation that she and others have introduced to help steer things in what they hope will be a healthy direction, and a new AI leadership council that Gov.

Jim Tressel announced on X Friday afternoon that after much “considerable thought and prayer,” he won’t be part of the 2026 race for governor in the Buckeye State.
“It has been an extraordinary honor of a lifetime for Ellen and me to serve alongside Gov. Mike Dewine and First Lady Fran DeWine,” Tressel wrote in the post. “After considerable thought and prayer, we have decided not to run for Governor in 2026.”
Tressel said he will focus the remainder of his term on giving his full attention to education and workforce issues in Ohio.
Tressel’s decision opens up a more straightforward path through the GOP primary for Vivek Ramaswamy, who clinched the Ohio party leadership’s nomination for governor in May.
As things stand, he’s on track to face Democrat Amy Acton in the general election next November.
Earlier this summer, Ramaswamy sat down with News 5’s John Kosich to about about his vision for Ohio in 2026 and beyond.

Michelle Lujan Grisham appears to have pressured members of the state Water Quality Control Commission to consider a petition reversing a rule the commission passed unanimously in May that banned fossil fuel wastewater from being used outside oilfield work and testing.,"A produced water pond in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM. Aerial support provided by LightHawk.)The administration of New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appears to have pressured members of the state Water Quality Control Commission to consider a petition reversing a rule the commission passed unanimously in May that banned fossil fuel wastewater from being used outside oilfield work and testing. 
The commission’s August meeting marked the first time in years that all four department secretaries on the panel had shown up at the same time, raising eyebrows. Those secretaries then led the push to support a new petition that would overturn a rule whose development entailed more than a year of hearings and scientific debate.

This story was produced in partnership with Capital & Main.

In a statement to SourceNM, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she “encouraged relevant cabinet secretaries to bring their expertise” to the proceedings. In an interview with Capital & Main and New Mexico PBS, James Kenney, the Environment Department secretary and a Water Quality Control Commissioner, said, “The governor did not explicitly ask us to all show up.” And recent reporting by the Santa Fe New Mexican reveals emails between the Governor’s Office, Kenney and other commissioners where they discussed pushing rules allowing wider use of oilfield wastewater “over the finish line.” 
When reached by phone at a bluegrass festival in Winfield, Kansas, on Wednesday, Water Quality Control Commission Chair Bruce Thomson said he was unaware of the email exchanges with commissioners. 
Thompson said he had not received any emails from the governor’s office and offered no comment when asked if he had concerns about the commission’s process. 
Many who supported the original rule are livid with the apparent meddling, explicit or not. “They’re putting politics over scientifically based policy, and that’s illegal,” said Mariel Nanasi, executive director of the environmental group New Energy Economy. State statute requires commissioners to recuse themselves if their impartiality or fairness “may be reasonably questioned.”
In a statement, Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for Lujan Grisham’s office, said, “The administration’s position on water reuse has been public for months. Directing secretaries to attend required meetings rather than send staff does not violate any laws.”
“This is the oddest, most political rule making I’ve seen in 25 years,” said Tannis Fox, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center. For nearly three decades she has worked on water issues while working in or alongside state government, including a five-year stint in the late 1990s as the legal counsel for the Water Quality Control Commission. 
At the center of the debate lies oilfield wastewater — also known as produced water — which is toxic and possibly laced with chemicals that operators consider “trade secrets” and do not have to publicly identify. Projects like the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium have worked for years to perfect industrial-scale wastewater purification. 
The Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance, which represents oil companies, wastewater treatment firms and other, unnamed parties, petitioned the committee to rewrite its ruling. It claimed the science of wastewater treatment had dramatically improved in the past year and the May ruling should therefore be rewritten. Environmental groups, which vigorously supported the original rule, say the rule should stand for its built-in five-year lifespan. 
At the August meeting, the four secretaries — from the Office of the State Engineer, the Environment Department, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health — were joined by the director of the Game and Fish Department and the chair of the Soil and Water Conservation Commission. A representative from New Mexico Tech, another from the State Parks Division and four members at large rounded out the meeting.
Led by Kenney, all but three voted to reverse course and proceed with the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance petition to pursue using treated wastewater outside the oilfields. No future hearings on the matter are currently scheduled. 
Kenney said, “It’s not uncommon for the cabinet to band together around a governor priority.”

That priority is the governor’s 50-Year Water Action Plan, he said. Among many initiatives, it calls for the state to develop a legal path for broader use of oilfield wastewater by 2026. The Water Quality Control Commission’s May vote likely eliminated that possibility.
“I just wish the administration would come out … and be upfront and transparent about what’s going on,” Fox said.
Two things are likely going on. One: Lujan Grisham wants a new source of water for industrial uses in a state suffering through a historic drought. And two: The oil and gas industry has a growing problem with tightly regulated, toxic wastewater it can’t easily dispose of. 
For years, Lujan Grisham and the industry have wanted to see one problem solve the other, with the wastewater cleaned and approved for use outside oilfield applications, currently the only legal use in New Mexico. That was a goal of the governor’s Strategic Water Supply, part of the 50-Year Water Action Plan. The supply creates a new water source for new businesses as the state’s freshwater supplies dwindle from climate change. The Strategic Water Supply bill originally included oilfield wastewater, but the state Legislature stripped out that language, leaving brackish aquifers deep underground as the sole source for new water.
The Legislature balked in large part because oilfield wastewater is highly toxic, hard to clean and difficult to test. Debating the idea before the Water Quality Control Commission switched the forum from the legislative to the bureaucratic realm, where the number of people involved is smaller and nearly all of them have been appointed by the governor.
Kenney has been on the commission since 2019 but until recently sent a representative to the commission meetings in his stead. At his first meeting in July, he supported the petition to remake the wastewater rule, though five of his own Environment Department scientists had previously testified that treated oilfield wastewater could not be safely used elsewhere. When he attended the August meeting, his second, Kenney led the commission to a divided vote to proceed with the petition. 
Kenney said that water treatment science had changed so much even before the commission’s May vote that the petition deserved to be considered. The May rule, he said, was guided by “2022 or earlier science” and the process didn’t allow for subsequent research to be admitted as evidence. Hearings do have cutoff dates after which new information generally can’t be introduced, to give commissioners a fixed set of information to ponder. “We couldn’t introduce new testimony,” he said.
Fox disagreed. “Scientific materials were NOT limited to 2022 materials, and peer reviewed articles and other materials from 2023 and 2024 came into evidence,” she said in an email. “It was possible to introduce into evidence science up through May 2024,” she said in a subsequent phone call. Deliberations ran for a year beyond that.
Fox acknowledged the technology to turn toxic brine into demonstrably safe water is “inching along.” Even so, “There hasn’t been some sort of earth-shattering [scientific] article that says, ‘Hey! We got this one! We got a silver bullet here!’” 
Jennifer Bradfute, president of the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance, disagrees. She said her group has a collection of recent scientific papers showing successful treatment of oilfield wastewater. During the August hearing, she held up as evidence a list of scientific papers she said she found on Google Scholar. 
Fox later dismissed the list, saying, “Some are relevant, some are not relevant, but none are showing that discharge at scale is safe. It’s just a bunch of articles on produced water.”
Pei Xu, a professor in the department of civil engineering at New Mexico State University and a lead researcher at the Produced Water Research Consortium, is at the bleeding edge of several scientific studies currently testing the safety of different water treatment and testing procedures for oilfield wastewater. In a detailed interview, she described current, unfinished studies quantifying any effects of treated water on small animals and plants. She also shared a half-dozen recent papers indicating successful treatment of oilfield wastewater.
Xu said she is confident that wastewater can be treated to safe levels today. However, she said, “If everybody looks for the peer-reviewed publications, I think we still need some time, especially related to all these ongoing studies.” Peer review, the gold standard of scientific research, allows other scientists in the field to critique the work done. It’s a process that can take months after the research has finished. 
In the end, Xu said that it’s not her decision to use treated water outside a testing laboratory — that rests with the state. “I will work on science, and then how they will utilize the data, it’ll be up to the regulators,” she said.

During the August hearing, commissioners asked Kenney if Environment Department scientists could validate the results of any new studies for the commission.
Environment Department scientists had previously testified that research into wastewater purification technology had not advanced to a point that it was safe to use in large scale applications beyond the oilfield.
“I suspect most of the commissioners do not feel they are technically qualified to determine whether the results that are presented by these … new papers and studies, if they are in fact truthful,” said Thomson, chair of the committee. 
In fact, state law says, “The water quality control commission shall receive staff support from the department of environment.”
At the commission meeting, however, Zachary Ogaz, general counsel for the Environment Department, said the department had “no obligation” to make its scientists available. And Kenney hedged, saying that department turnover means scientists would “need to get up to speed” in order to testify before the commission. 
“While I think it’s important to have a regulator validate the science, I think it is the obligation of the parties to present testimony that can be verified and validated,” he said.
On Sept. 4, Mariel Nanasi of New Energy Economy filed a motion requesting that the Water Quality Control Commission require the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance to “disclose the scientific basis” relied on to develop its petition.
On Sept. 19, Bradfute’s group responded, asking the commission to deny that motion, calling it an “extra-regulatory” requirement that should be addressed in a hearing. Even so, the response included a statement from a scientist working at a Texas-based wastewater treatment company outlining the last three years of water treatment science, concluding, “The use of treated produced water can occur in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, provided treatment is robust, monitoring comprehensive, and regulatory safeguards enforced.” It went on to list 16 new and older papers on wastewater science.
***
Oilfield wastewater is a growing, expensive headache for oil and gas producers across the country, particularly in the Permian Basin — the nation’s most productive oilfield — which straddles Texas and New Mexico. Around five barrels of wastewater are produced for every barrel of oil in the Permian Basin, and the total has increased every year as the basin’s production has grown. 
The water is highly saline and loaded with naturally occurring minerals as well as chemicals added in the drilling process. All of that eventually comes back up the well, mixed with the oil and gas. Sometimes the water is contaminated with naturally occurring radioactive minerals, too. 
Neither the federal government nor New Mexico requires drillers to publicly list drilling chemicals considered “trade secrets,” so it’s not perfectly known what goes down and up a well. Colorado does require operators to disclose all chemicals used in fracking, but a recent study alleges that companies there don’t always do so. Chevron, one of the companies named in the study, is represented on the board of the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance. (Since the report came out, Chevron has complied with the Colorado law.)
The overarching issue is what to do with the produced water. A small percentage is lightly cleaned and reused to drill new wells — a process that uses millions of gallons per well. For years, companies have also injected the water back into the ground, but that triggers earthquakes and some spectacular leaks. New Mexico tallies how much wastewater is produced and how much is injected, but it doesn’t track how much is shipped to Texas for disposal. The problems continue there.

Recently, ConocoPhillips said it is producing less oil and more water than expected in a Texas field just south of the New Mexico state line because of wastewater contamination from nearby disposal wells. In a motion filed with the Texas Railroad Commission (the state’s main oil and gas regulatory body), ConocoPhillips opposed Pilot Water Solutions’ plan to drill an additional wastewater well in the area. The motion read, “Pilot is banking on increased regional need for disposal capacity resulting from wells producing waste in other Texas counties and New Mexico.” Last year, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division cancelled 75 proposed wastewater wells along the same stretch of border due to increasingly frequent earthquakes. ConocoPhillips also has a board member at the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance. 
Bradfute, the alliance president, helped write New Mexico’s law on oil and gas wastewater that clarified who had oversight of the water and barred its use outside the oilfield. The law also created the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium to study how to clean and test produced water so it can eventually be used more broadly. Despite years of testing, however, the constantly shifting nature of what is in wastewater raises questions about the treated water’s safety, which is what led the Water Quality Control Commission to nix its broader use in May.
Bradfute formed the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance in September 2024, three weeks after final arguments were made in the commission’s original hearings. She said that timing is coincidental — the original impetus was to promote treating brackish and produced water in response to Gov. Lujan Grisham’s 50-Year Water Action Plan.
Bradfute said there are about 25 members of the alliance, but she wouldn’t name them. “Some of my members have been pretty severely attacked by different interest groups as a result of the rulemaking,” she said. “There’s been false Instagram and TikTok videos that certain groups are putting out there definitely attacking individuals by name,” she continued.
Stephen Aldridge, the mayor of tiny Jal, New Mexico, is an Alliance board member with a history of wrangling over water in his corner of the state. Joining was a quick decision for him.
“If there’s a conversation on water in New Mexico, we want a seat at the table,” he said.
Since becoming mayor eight years ago, Aldridge has tussled with a series of oil and water companies that wanted to tap the town’s aquifers for water to drill oil wells in the surrounding Permian Basin. 
“Yeah, they don’t like me very much,” he said. “But hell, I’ve got two friends I’m not looking for anymore.” Besides, he said, “I’m damn sure an advocate for this community. That’s my job.”
The work has secured the town water for the foreseeable future, but only just. Aldridge says that there isn’t any excess to promote new business growth. That’s why he has his eye on produced water. Truckloads of the stuff rumble through his town every day.
“I’m not without my concerns, but I’m also inquisitive enough to want to see some pilot [projects] up and running, and I would think that others would be too,” he said. In particular he worries about the toxic remains from the water treatment process. Aldridge knows there would be a lot of it: Where would it go?
He’s waited years, watching the water cleaning science improve. He thinks it will be safe, eventually. Meanwhile, “Let’s don’t hurt ourselves in the process of tripping over a dollar to pick up a dime,” he said.  



Key WATR Alliance Players:
The Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance includes several political and industry heavy-hitters: 

John D’Antonio, a produced water consultant; former state engineer (the state’s top water bureaucrat) appointed by Lujan Grisham; also New Mexico Environment Department secretary under Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson
Deanna Archuleta, a member of the Vogel Group lobbying and consulting firm; former Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist for Exxon-Mobil; and controversial appointee to head the state Game Commission by Lujan Grisham
Jason Sandel, a friend and political donor to Lujan Grisham and the head of a Farmington-based oilfield services conglomerate
Tiffany Polak, policy adviser for Occidental Petroleum; a former deputy director of the state’s Oil Conservation Division
Kathy Ytuarte, the former director of administrative services at the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association

(Photo courtesy of attorney general's office)Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas has found probable cause that a Clay County teacher displayed “gross immorality” in posting about Charlie Kirk’s death, he announced Monday as Attorney General James Uthmeier launched a tip line to report “violent extremism.”
The teacher, left nameless by Kamoutsas, could lose her teaching license after she posted to social media, “This may not be the obituary. [sic] We were all hoping to wake up to, but this is a close second for me,” News 4 Jax reported. Kamoutsas said the post included an article about Kirk’s assassination, which occurred at a college in Utah. 
In keeping with his promise two weeks ago to investigate teachers making “despicable comments” about Kirk’s death, Kamoutsas said he found probable cause on four Education Code violations. Either the teacher can forfeit her license, or she can be tried in front of department’s Education Practices Commission or the Department of Administrative Hearings.
The commissioner is seeking the revocation of the teacher’s license. 
Teachers among those answering to employers after Charlie Kirk social media posts

“As these posts continue to circulate, more and more students are exposed to the dangerous and false idea that violence is an acceptable response to differing beliefs, an idea that has no place and will have no place here in Florida schools,” Kamoutsas said. 
The four standards Kamoutsas alleges the teacher breached are gross immorality, failure to protect the health, safety and welfare of students, reduced effectiveness as an educator, and failing to distinguish her personal views from the school’s.
“Holding educators accountable for speech that celebrates violence in schools is not a violation of free speech, it is a necessary step to uphold the standards of the teaching profession and the safety of our schools,” Kamoutsas said. 
Last week, Florida Education Association President Andrew Spar told the Phoenix that the commissioner’s letter to superintendents vowing investigations sends a “chilling effect throughout the profession.”
“For the commissioner to say there’s no longer a second-chance mentality in education and that he’s going to personally investigate and essentially be the investigator, the prosecutor, and the judge and jury in all of these cases is quite concerning,” Spar said.

New portal for complaints
On a broader scope, Uthmeier’s office opened the “Combatting Violent Extremism Portal” “where people will be able to report anything they observe or hear that is a call for violence or a threat for violence against other individuals,” he said. 
“Let me be clear, we respect the First Amendment more than anybody. We’re not going to be the cancel culture that we’ve seen from so long from the Left. We’re not going to believe in silencing individuals. But there’s a big difference when it comes to a threat of violence, a call for violence. That is not protected by the First Amendment,” Uthmeier said. 
Since Kirk’s death, people nationwide have lost jobs for speaking about Kirk’s death in a manner their employer views as disfavored, such as late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.
Teachers are held to higher standards than many other professions, the state officials said.
“It’s never been more important for people to speak up, for us to have safe academic environments where people feel confident to engage in discussion, free from attack, free from violence,” Uthmeier said. 
The portal, not exclusive to education settings, allows people to submit screenshots, videos, or other evidence of threatened violence to Uthmeier’s office, anonymously if they want to.
“We must protect before people are shot, before explosives go off,” Uthmeier said. 
Warning against abusing the portal, Uthmeier said, “We’re going to take everything seriously and, if you abuse this, if you provide something in a dishonest fashion to law enforcement, we’ll hold you accountable as well.”
The campaign in-part mimics the Office of Parental Rights Uthmeier added to his office earlier this year to field complaints alleging violation of parental-rights laws. 
“The First Amendment does not protect speech that is likely and intended to provoke immediate acts of violence, or speech that expresses a serious intent to commit a specific act of violence, but it does protect robust free expression, which includes criticism of the past words and actions of prominent public figures,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said in an online statement last week following the state’s announcement it would investigate teachers.
“Dissent, disagreement, and counterspeech that criticizes political views should not be confused with condoning or encouraging violence,” the ACLU said, and retaliation for such speech “feeds hostility and division.”
After Kirk was killed, the ACLU continued, “Most people likely encountered speech they found despicable no matter where they fall on the political spectrum — that is the nature of a democracy where free speech is protected. While calling for further violence or condoning what happened to Charlie Kirk is wrong, many of the posts being cited for retaliation constitute core protected speech.”

The Ukrainian couple left behind their home and their careers to seek safety after Russia invaded in 2021.
On Sunday, they promoted peace by singing duets at a fundraiser for their fellow Ukrainian families in North Dakota and Minnesota.
“We want peace,” Somkin said. “We also want to say thank you to the Americans for supporting us.”
Somkin is living in North Dakota under the Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed citizens of that country to enter the U.S. under humanitarian parole. 
The continuation of that opportunity, however, is uncertain.

So far, Ukrainians have been allowed to stay in the U.S. until their temporary status reaches its expiration date, according to Global Refuge, a nonprofit that oversees refugee and immigrant services. 
Previously, renewals to this temporary status were common. Changes by President Donald Trump’s administration, however, have slowed document processing, meaning many Ukrainians are at risk of losing their legal status and work authorization.
Somkin was a soloist with the Kyiv Symphony Orchestra and Choir when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2021. On Sunday, his music entertained hundreds of supporters who came to support and raise money for the Ukrainian community. The event was held on International Day of Peace in Moorhead’s Gooseberry Park.
“It’s a terrible situation,” said Michael Southam, co-founder of FM Volunteers for Ukraine, which hosted the event. “The war (in Ukraine) is still going on. It’s not safe for them to return home, but some haven’t worked in several months because their renewal requests haven’t been processed.”
Southam has sponsored seven Ukrainians since the U4U program began. As a sponsor, he helps immigrants find housing and employment. He never anticipated that those opportunities would be shut off.
“Most of us assumed the war wouldn’t last a full two years or, if it did, we’d be able to comfortably respond and figure out how to continue to help them,” Southam said.
North Dakota’s first Ukrainian arrivals came in 2023. Most have filed requests to renew their parolee status and work authorization, but few have received any response, Southam said. Some Ukrainians who came to the states under U4U have been unable to work since June.

An anonymous donor gave a $5,000 matching gift for the event. Overall, more than $10,000 was raised, Southam said.
There were vendors and tables with crafts. There was entertainment and laughter. Somkin led his Bismarck church choir in the singing of the Ukrainian anthem. 
“We’re so happy to be here,” he said. “We have so many in our community who need to be able to work.”
Yaroslav Riazanov of Fargo is one of those who wants to return to work. Over the past two years, he has worked construction and driven trucks. He dreams of opening his own business making furniture.
But for now, he is unable to work. He filed paperwork to extend his work authorization several months ago. He’s still waiting for a response.
“I hope I can get my papers,” he said. “My money has run out and nobody knows what will happen tomorrow.”
He then paused and gestured towards a group of friends. He said he is frustrated that he can’t work to cover his own bills.
“Everyone wants to stay here and help this country,” he said. “We also want to help our families in Ukraine. We just need a chance to do it.”

Susie Gross and her husband, Derrick Gross, attended Sunday’s event representing CATCH, an organization that promotes legal immigration as a way to bolster rural communities.
The U.S. promised safety and security to Ukrainians, she said. The country needs to honor those promises.
“I’m a person of my word,” she said. “I want my country to be, too.”
Legal immigrants are hard-working and committed to their communities, she said. In rural areas, they can fill needed services to keep open institutions like health care facilities and schools. 
For her, the issue is also personal. Gross’s son married a woman who came from Ukraine under the U4U program. Her daughter-in-law’s mother works in health care; a younger sister attends school in a rural area.
“We have seen how immigration strengthens our communities,” Gross said. “Unfortunately, it’s a disorienting and scary time. It’s good to show our support.”
Southam said some Ukrainian families have left North Dakota and more are planning to leave. The uncertainty is too difficult, he said. And yet, the next step is not clear either.
Riazanov said he avoids thinking about where he’d go if he can’t support himself here.
“I don’t know,” he said. “I want to stay here. That’s the problem.”

(Getty Images)For many Granite Staters who rely on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace to access health insurance, premium tax credits from the federal government represent the difference between coverage and catastrophe.
But that lifeline is about to fray.
In New Hampshire, nearly 50,000 residents benefit from premium tax credits that help them afford health coverage through the ACA Marketplace. That’s approximately 70.7% of all ACA Marketplace enrollees in the state. These are Granite Staters who don’t have access to traditional employer-sponsored insurance — like a parent who works part time while their child is in school, the waiter at your favorite restaurant, freelancers, your hair stylist, small-business owners, and older adults not yet eligible for Medicare. Premium tax credits cut average monthly premiums nearly in half — from $469 to $230 — making health insurance attainable for many.
Unless Congress acts swiftly to extend these tax credits, which are set to expire on Dec. 31, Granite Staters will face staggering premium hikes in 2026. According to new data released recently by New Futures, New Hampshire’s leading health policy organization, in conjunction with Families USA, a couple in their early 60s earning $90,000 could see their annual premiums jump by over $14,000. A single individual in their mid-40s making $31,300 would pay $1,344 more per year. Nationally, experts warn that up to one-third of Marketplace enrollees could lose coverage as a result of the expiring tax credits.
For one New Hampshire resident and her family, the enhanced premium tax credits have made health insurance affordable. She works part time while her partner works at a local bakery; neither have access to employer-provided health insurance. Thanks to the tax credits, their family pays $99 monthly for coverage. Without the tax credits, that cost would nearly triple to $291 according to a KFF calculator. This represents a significant jump, and one she says would be challenging for them to cover. “With two young kids, life is expensive, and the expiration of the premium tax credits will set us back at a time when we’re hoping to save up for a home,” she explains. For families like hers across New Hampshire, the stakes could not be higher.
This isn’t just a policy failure, it’s a looming affordability crisis.
New Hampshire is the second-oldest state in the country, and one of only 11 where adults now outnumber children. Midlife and older adults (ages 45 to 64) make up 48% of Marketplace enrollees in New Hampshire, and they are especially vulnerable to premium spikes. A 2024 Altarum survey of Granite Staters revealed the impact of rising health care costs in the state:

71% of respondents delayed or went without care due to cost in the year prior
53% worried about affording prescription drugs
41% struggled to pay medical bills

These numbers aren’t abstract — they represent neighbors, coworkers, and loved ones already rationing care.
Without federal action extending the enhanced premium tax credits, health care will become even further out of reach for many of our residents. More information about the premium tax credits is available at www.new-futures.org.
Health care should never be a luxury. It’s time to protect the progress we’ve made and ensure that every resident can access the care they need when they need it.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acataxcredits-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 12:58:59.408007

Hawkeye Community College announced in a news release it has received a three-year, $407,940 grant from Americorps for its Senior Companion Program, in which volunteers aged 55 years or older are matched with older adults in the area to provide aid and company.

The Waterloo college announced in late June program operations had to end due to its Americorps grant funding — making up $400,000 of the program’s $500,000 budget — being held for review by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
“We are such an incredible part of this community that it hurts deeply to not be able to continue to offer a service that benefits some of our most vulnerable constituents,” said Hawkeye Community College Provost Lynn LaGrone in a previous interview.
Before its pause, the senior companion program involved 52 companions who worked with 81 local clients, according to the college. Now that the program is once again funded, 48 volunteers have or are planning to return, with four more ready to work once they’ve matched with clients, the release stated.
The community college has also rehired a full-time administrative assistant and a part-time van driver, the release stated, and will hire a program manager in the future.
The senior companion program is one of the oldest initiatives still in operation at Hawkeye Community College, LaGrone previously said in an interview, having connected volunteers and seniors since 1976. LaGrone said at the time she was “cautiously optimistic” about federal funding coming back after its review.

Matt Lawless, one of six “local celebrities” who performed in Dancing with the Burlington Stars, says it gave him a chance to “be in public in a different kind of way.”

This story by Briana Brady was first published by the Shelburne News on Sept. 14.
Town managers have a lot of skills when it comes to dealing with town budgets or supporting the selectboard — financial acuity, communication, fluency in local and state laws and, often, patience.
On Saturday, Sept. 13, Shelburne’s town manager, Matt Lawless, got up on stage at the Flynn Theater in Burlington to display a different kind of skill: a willingness to boogie.
Lawless was one of six “local celebrities” in Dancing with the Burlington Stars, an annual fundraiser for the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired. The event pairs each local star with a professional, mostly instructors at local dance schools, to put together a routine and compete in front of a panel of judges.
This year, along with Lawless, the local celebrities included a local pediatrician, an elementary school principal and a TV meteorologist. Spoiler alert: Lawless didn’t end up winning —the title went to Dr. Becca Bell — but he did have a lot of fun.
“It’s nice to be in public in a different kind of way. There’s aspects of performance to being in public service, but you only ever see certain parts of people. It’s a nice reminder that people are complicated and have lots of different interests. I’m happy to show a different side of myself,” Lawless said.
Lawless, who has a background in theater, recalled one memorable community theater role in which he played Satan’s jester, a large cat, gamely hissing on stage and climbing up the walls.
He was paired at the Saturday event with Elizabeth Seyler, also known as Dr. Tango, a dance scholar and instructor who specializes in the Argentine tango. He said the two of them spent a lot of time just listening to music and talking about what kind of story they wanted to tell.
The piece Lawless and Seyler performed was equally theatrical, with Lawless playing a bumbling sous chef to Seyler’s exacting chef de cuisine. The two chased each other around the stage, at one point enacting a kind of swordfight using a rolling pin and a wooden spoon. Eventually, they made up, learning to dance together.
The performances from the rest of the celebrities were equally full of joy. It was easy to see why the fundraising has grown. This year, the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired sold over 800 tickets, with the proceeds going to support its programs.
Lawless said it reminded him how much he loved that kind of creative expression. He plans on finding more ways to dance, maybe with a dance improv group or one of Vermont’s social swing clubs. He might even get back into community theater.
“It’s a really fun, creative way to express yourself and think differently, move differently, that I had been missing,” he said.

Young I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/goldberg-drops-legal-effort-to-prevent-obriens-return-to-ccc/,A judge late Wednesday said Goldberg was not likely to succeed in her appeal and denied the treasurer's request to block O'Brien from returning to her job as CCC chair while the appeal played out.,"TREASURER DEBORAH GOLDBERG is dropping her appeal of Shannon O’Brien’s reinstatement as chairwoman of the Cannabis Control Commission, her office said, a decision that likely spells an end to the two-year legal and political saga.
An Appeals Court judge late Wednesday said Goldberg was not likely to succeed in her appeal and denied the treasurer’s request to block O’Brien from returning to her job as CCC chair while the appeal played out. With that stay denied, Goldberg said Thursday she informed the attorney general’s office that she does not want to press the appeal any further.
“My focus must remain on the people I serve as Treasurer. Our work includes building new schools, strengthening the pension fund for our retirees, and creating new economic opportunities in every community across the state. I also believe that continuing with an appeal will further harm the Cannabis Control Commission and impede their ability to focus on their critical priorities,” Goldberg said in a statement to the News Service. “I remain steadfast in my commitment to fairness, integrity and civil discourse. The most meaningful way for me to honor my values is by focusing on our priorities at the Treasurer’s office.”
When she initially sought to appeal O’Brien’s reinstatement, Goldberg said in a court filing that preventing O’Brien’s return to work was needed “in order to avoid serious disruption to the ongoing work of the Cannabis Control Commission.”
Joe Baerlein, a spokesman for O’Brien said she was “gratified” to hear that Goldberg was dropping her appeal “and that the independent CCC can operate without any further interference from the Treasurer.”
“Chair O’Brien looks forward to continuing her career of exemplary public service and ensuring that the CCC fulfils its statutory obligations so that the CCC can serve the public as originally intended,” he said.
Goldberg had argued that Superior Court Judge Robert Gordon “got it wrong” with his ruling this month that O’Brien was entitled to be reinstated as chair of the CCC with back pay as a result of having been unlawfully suspended and then fired by Goldberg. In her statement Thursday, the treasurer said that she has “profound issues” with the decision she is no longer appealing.
“The decision minimizes the seriousness of Shannon O’Brien’s behavior, and also sends a discouraging message to those who came forward with their concerns. The Judge failed to protect them. Every person deserves a workplace free from harassment, bullying, intimidation, and discrimination. This is not a far-fetched idea and is simply about treating people with respect and decency,” Goldberg said. “When I attempted to have discussions with Shannon O’Brien about her language and behavior, rather than working with me, she responded by hiring attorneys and subjecting us to two years of litigation.”
When she fired her last September, Goldberg charged that O’Brien had “committed gross misconduct and demonstrated she is unable to discharge the powers and duties of a CCC commissioner.” But Gordon determined the evidence that Goldberg relied on “does not remotely suffice” to support O’Brien’s firing.
At the end of his ruling that vacated Goldberg’s termination decision, Gordon emphasized that O’Brien is to be reinstated “effective immediately and without further delay,” putting the last three words in bold and underlined text.
O’Brien’s term as chair of the CCC was set to run through August 31, 2027. The next public meeting of the CCC, which has been led in recent months by Acting Chair Bruce Stebbins, is scheduled for Monday, September 29.
Goldberg’s decision to stop pressing the O’Brien matter in court comes days after she announced that she plans to seek a fourth four-year term next year.
The Mass. Republican Party ramped up its criticism of Goldberg in the wake of the court ruling that said the treasurer was wrong to have fired O’Brien, slamming her for using taxpayer money in the legal fight and for “insulating her politically-connected staffers.” The party, which did not have a candidate for treasurer in 2022, said at least one Republican will announce plans to run for the office by the end of this year.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OBrien-leaving-court-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 12:58:59.408007

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library)The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in North Dakota may not open to the public until July 4, 2026, but the education and virtual learning events for the 26th president begin this week.
The library is hosting a virtual programming series featuring book talks, discussions of Roosevelt’s favorite recipes and a behind-the-scenes virtual tour of the library.
Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer, said the library plans to hold about two virtual events every month, continuing after the facility opens. In addition, the library will hold in-person events once it opens, including single-day and multi-day symposiums, he said.
“You can fully expect a complete schedule from us moving forward,” Briney said.
The first event starts at 7:30 p.m. EST Monday. It will feature David Gessner, a creative writing professor for the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and his book, “Leave It As It Is,” which retraces Roosevelt’s footsteps and conservation legacy.
Many of the virtual events will feature authors who published books on the president that explored a specific time during Roosevelt’s life, such as the 1912 election, his time exploring the Amazon or his time at his North Dakota ranches, according to the event website.

Susan Sarna, senior curator of collections for the library, said those authors provide unique and detailed aspects of Roosevelt’s life, and together give a greater view of the former president’s life as a whole.
With the virtual learning series and exhibits, Sarna said the library is accumulating a one-stop shop of information and artifacts on Roosevelt.
About half of the pieces that will be on display are from private collections and never before seen in a public setting, such as a diary Roosevelt kept after the deaths of his wife and mother occurred on the same day, Sarna said.
“At the library, we really try to start from scratch and go all the way through to after his death and how the world was affected by his death,” Sarna said. “No other site has the time, the square footage, to cover all of this and I think that’s one of the most exciting things is that you are going to get a full picture of this man.”
Construction of the library remains on track for its July 2026 grand opening, Briney said.

An annual report documents the state's failure to make adequate progress for foster kids. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas for the fourth straight year failed to meet legal requirements to improve the severe instability of the foster care system or provide mental health services to children who need them, according to an annual report from an independent evaluator.
The failings include an alarming spike in the number of kids who were stuck sleeping in offices, minimal progress in the high rate in which kids who enter the foster care system are moved from one location to another, and the one-third of foster kids who need but don’t receive mental health services.
The report by Judith Meltzer and the Center for the Study of Social Policy documented the broken promises the state made in January 2021 when it agreed to settle a lawsuit with Kansas Appleseed over severe instability within the foster care system. The state promised to achieve specific outcomes for foster children, such as lowering the rate of placement moves and meeting mental health needs of foster children. The settlement agreement calls for an annual progress report by an independent evaluator.
“The report should be a wake-up call for anyone who cares about the well-being of children in Kansas,” said Leecia Welch, deputy legal director at Children’s Rights, which is part of Kansas Appleseed’s legal team.
“Each of these data points reflects a child whose life is in limbo — not knowing where she will sleep that night, missing school, and disconnected from family and friends,” Welch added.
In the report, which examines performance from the 2024 calendar year, Meltzer praised the state’s commitment to improving outcomes. That includes new contracts for foster care providers KVC Kansas, Saint Francis Ministries, Cornerstones of Care, TFI Family Services and EmberHope that set caseload limits based on national accreditation standards.
“We, along with our partners, have worked diligently to meet eight of the obligations agreed to under the settlement agreement and I’m proud of what we have accomplished and how we are improving the experience for young people in Kansas foster care,” said Laura Howard, secretary of the Department for Children and Families. “But there’s more to do. We remain committed to maintaining these results and pressing forward to fulfill the remaining commitments.”
Most foster kids are in stable placements, the report found.
But the few who aren’t are subjected to extreme instability.
Children who entered the foster care system in 2024 were moved at a rate of 7.24 times per 1,000 days, a slight improvement from the 7.94 moves in 2023 but still much higher than the target of 4.4 that the state agreed to meet when it settled the lawsuit.
About 83% of children experienced one or fewer moves during the year, below the target of 90%.
The report highlighted an alarming increase in the failure to place kids, which refers to a child sleeping in an office, hotel or other unlicensed setting. In 2024, there were 100 children who spent 316 nights without a placement, compared with 57 children with a total of 83 nights the year before. In 2024, almost all of those kids were in the Wichita area.
The report found minimal progress in eliminating night-to-night placements, where a child is picked up in the morning, sometimes as early as 6 a.m., and spends all day in an office or unlicensed center before returning to a placement after 8 p.m. That happened 2,006 times for 824 children.
“Overall findings related to placement stability are consistent with previous reporting — case reviews found that most children in DCF custody are in a stable placement, but children without stable placements continue to experience a concerning number of nights without placement (FTPs) and night-to-night and short-term placements that do not meet the needs of children,” Meltzer wrote in the report. “For a number of children, this placement instability is extreme.”
Just 4% of foster kids account for 50% of the total moves, the report said.
The state showed significant improvement in providing timely mental health and trauma screenings for kids entering foster care, with 94% receiving the initial screen. In 2023, just 69% did.
However, just 66% of foster kids who have an identified mental health need are actually receiving services. That’s an improvement from 52% in 2023, but still below the performance of 70% in 2022, and well below the target of 90%.
The report cited placement instability as a factor in delaying mental health services to kids who need them.
Meltzer identified the new contracts with foster care providers as a reason to be optimistic about future progress. The new caseload requirements, which were only in effect for half of last year, are “very promising” and already leading to “positive results,” she wrote, based on conversations she had with contractors.
The report notes that the Legislature rejected DCF’s request earlier this year to fund more specialized case management teams.
Meltzer said the state should look at investing additional resources in the Wichita area ,where the placement instability is concentrated. That could include adding more behavioral health intervention teams, support for kinship caregivers, and more therapeutic family foster homes.
EmberHope took over the contract for the Wichita area in July 2024. Saint Francis formerly held the contract.
Teresa Woody, litigation director for Kansas Appleseed, said it was concerning that western Kansas, which is still served by Saint Francis, and the Wichita area “continue to have severe, if not worsening, placement problems.”
“It is especially concerning that many of the children in these regions who lack stable placements are children as young as 2 years old,” Woody said.
Kansas Appleseed filed the lawsuit in 2018 on behalf of foster kids who were being failed by the state’s privatized child welfare system, which is administered across three agencies — the Department for Children and Families, the Department for Aging and Disability Services, and the Department of Health and Environment.
The two sides entered mediation earlier this year.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The chair of the House Ways and Means Committee said she will forgo a run for reelection — and a potential shot at speaker of the House — to make a bid for Howard County executive in 2026.
Del. Vanessa E. Atterbeary (D-Howard), in an interview Friday, said she came to the decision this summer after a tough budget session and a milestone birthday — she turned 50 in June. Atterbeary is expected to make a formal announcement at an Oct. 15 event.
“I really love being in Annapolis. I really enjoy making policy.” Atterbeary said. “But at the end of this past session, I just started to think about what I wanted my future to look like.”
Atterbeary joins Howard County Council person Deb Jung and Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard) in a race to succeed County Executive Calvin Ball. The two-term Democrat is term limited and cannot run again. Both Atterbeary and Feldmark serve on the House Way and Means Committee. Feldmark has chaired the revenue subcommittee since 2023.
Atterbeary was named to lead the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022 by House Speaker Adrienne Jones. She was considered a potential candidate to become the next speaker should Jones, who turns 71 in November, decide not to seek an eighth full term in the House.
Jones filed for re-election in June.
“I’m sure the expectation from a lot of people and from myself, frankly, was to stay and try to be the next speaker, whenever Speaker Jones decided to retire,” Atterbeary said.  “A group of folks over well over a year ago approached me about running for county executive. I just put it out of my mind, because, as you know, we were dealing the past couple sessions with some very serious budget issues, and I was just primarily focused on that.”
But Atterbeary revisited the idea after the 2025 session and her 50th birthday in June.
“The more I thought about it, the more I just felt like my time there has come to an end,” she said. “Over the years, I have brought people together and worked really hard on what I felt passionate about. So I feel that there are issues here in the county that need to be worked on, and need to be worked on by a strong, proven leader who has the ability to bring people together.
“And when I looked at who was in the field, there wasn’t just anyone in the field that I felt could do that. And so I decided that this is where I want to focus my effort and my energy and put my name in the race,” Atterbeary said.

BURLINGTON — A Burlington police officer shot at a suspect on Sunday evening after a standoff with police on Riverside Avenue escalated throughout the day. Vermont State Police are currently investigating the shooting, according to a press release. 
While police said in the release that the suspect is currently in custody and receiving medical care for sustained injuries, they did not explicitly say that the man was injured by the officer. The officer who fired at the man remains unidentified and has been placed on paid administrative leave by the department. 
The Burlington Police Department responded to a disturbance at the man’s apartment building at 7:30 a.m. on Sunday, then announced in a later press release that there was an active incident on the road involving a person in crisis. 
By early afternoon, police had blocked off the street between Intervale Avenue and Bright Street. Police officers could be seen standing in the building’s parking lot, crouched over a police cruiser with their guns drawn and pointing toward the back of the building.

Kenna Dwinell, who lives in the apartment complex, heard the suspect “yelling and screaming and threatening the police all day,” she said. 
The confrontation started that morning when Dwinell said she woke up to police presence outside the building. She was asked to leave around 11:30 a.m. noting that since then the situation had clearly escalated, she said on Sunday afternoon. Dwinell was part of a small group of residents and community members who stood across the street and watched as police and first responders swarmed the site. 
Dwinell said she contacted police about the same man on Friday after he appeared to be in a mental health crisis and was destroying her outside Halloween decorations. Before that incident, the man seemed quiet, and she had never heard any complaints from other residents about him, she said. 
The road remained blocked off into the night on Sunday. Vermont State Police Major Crime Unit is investigating the incident, Vermont State Police said in their release.

Northern Counties Health Care's Medical Director has seen a lot of pain, and knows treating it requires more than a visit to the body shop. It requires a mind-body shop.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  People are not cars.","A message from Dr. Tim Tanner, Northern Counties Health Care’s Medical Director and family physician for more than 30 years:
In my career as a primary care physician, I have witnessed a lot of pain. This includes, for example, the sharp physical pain of a nasty strep throat infection, the crushing pain of a heart attack, the burning pain of nerve damage caused by diabetes, and the deep pain of metastatic cancer. It also includes the emotional pain from traumatic life events, the death of a loved one, and the self-blame for past actions or inactions. Even with over three decades of observation, I still cannot explain why we seem to pay more attention to physical pain than emotional pain.
There are various scales to rate the severity of physical pain. (I particularly like the 1-10 scale in which pain level 5 is “Bees?” and level 6 is “BEES!”.)

There is medical jargon used to describe the source of pain such as neuropathic, visceral, or inflammatory. There is not the same level of specificity or quantification when speaking of emotional pain, and maybe that is as it should be. The terms used for emotional pain such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are both broad and nuanced. Although there may not be much benefit in assigning a 1-10 scale to emotional pain, I think it deserves the same level of attention as physical pain. Physical pain and emotional pain can interfere with our daily functions and nightly sleep. Both can consume our attention, force joy from our lives and turn an ordinary day into another 24 hours of survival.
I have often heard, “I can take a lot of pain,” or “I have a high pain threshold.” These statements always are in reference to physical pain. I have never heard anyone say the same about emotional pain. I am sure individuals have different thresholds for tolerating emotional and physical pain. Things have to get bad enough before someone suffering with pain reaches out for help. I have been simultaneously impressed and distressed by how long some people live with their pain before seeking help. There are often several reasons: hope that things will get better with time, cost, fear of what might be discovered, embarrassment that they cannot fix things on their own.
All pain is treatable, although it may not be curable. I break down the treatment of any problem, including pain, into three categories, self-management, pharmacological (medications) and non-pharmacological. Choosing among these categories depends on what is known to be effective and safe, what is available and affordable, and what fits best with the person’s values and priorities. Sometimes treatment may involve self-care such as exercise. It may involve pills. It may involve “talk therapy” or peer support. It’s great when there are good options in all three categories. This is the case for treating emotional pain.
I am very fortunate to work in a setting where I can call on behavioral health colleagues to help manage a person’s pain, be it emotional, physical or both. Our team covers all three categories above. Their expertise adds to the relief of pain that can be relieved, and coping with the pain that remains. Behavioral health professionals work side by side with medical providers in our offices. They are an integral part of our primary care teams, assuring that we fulfill our goal of treating the whole, complicated, physical and emotional person. Maybe its self-flattery, but I like to think we are mind-body shops, not just body shops.

Here are the candidates so far,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/22/field-grows-in-mississippis-2026-us-senate-race-here-are-the-candidates-so-far/,U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith is facing challengers in the Republican primary in 2026. Democrats and an independent are also running.,"Several new candidates have entered Mississippi’s 2026 U.S. Senate race in recent weeks. 
The general election is more than 13 months away, but the deadline to file paperwork to run for federal offices is Dec. 26, according to the secretary of state’s office. 
Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith is running for a second full term in office. She is favored to defend her seat from Democrats, who haven’t elected a U.S. senator in Mississippi since John Stennis in 1982. 
Facing a Senate map that many analysts say favors Republicans, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said he’s looking for ways to break the GOP’s ironclad grip on Mississippi in 2026. 
Democrats have long believed the U.S. Senate was designed to over-represent small states, leading to a structural advantage for Republicans. That and President Donald Trump’s return to power have sparked renewed discussion in Democratic politics about how the party can become competitive in Republican-led states. 
This could prompt the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senate Committee to spend millions on the race in the Magnolia State. At the end of June, Hyde-Smith’s campaign committee had just over $1.4 million in cash on hand. 
Hyde-Smith has also attracted two Republican primary challengers, neither of whom has held elected office. 
Party primaries are March 10, and the general election is Nov. 3, 2026. Here is an updated look at the field and the candidates’ backgrounds. 
Republican Primary
Cindy Hyde-Smith  — The Brookhaven native is the first woman elected to represent Mississippi in Congress. She served in the Mississippi Senate and as state agriculture commissioner before moving to the statewide post. In early 2018, then-Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her to the U.S. Senate to replace Republican Thad Cochran, who opted to retire. She won a special election later in 2018 to serve the remaining two years on the term Cochran started, and she won a full, six-year term in 2020. 
Hyde-Smith is “100% MAGA”, according to Trump, who has already endorsed her. She launched her reelection campaign in late August by highlighting her advocacy for Mississippi farmers, her fight to restrict abortion rights and her close ties to the White House
“I can send a text to President Trump, and he responds,” Hyde-Smith said at her campaign launch. 
In 2018 and 2020, Hyde-Smith defeated Democrat Mike Espy, an attorney and former congressman who served as U.S. secretary of agriculture during President Bill Clinton’s administration. 
Sarah Adlakha  — A physician from Ocean Springs, Adlakha said in her campaign announcement that she was running to “stand with President Trump to secure our border, stop reckless spending, and fight for Mississippi families.” Adlakha also told Mississippi Today she would work across the aisle to improve access to health care in Mississippi. 
“I feel like not enough is being done from our representatives. I think we need people who are more effective and ready to actually go in there and work and legislate,” Adlakha said. “It’s not so much that I disagree with (Hyde-Smith’s) policies. I just feel like she could be doing so much more in the Senate to help our state.” 
In one of her first public events last week, Adlakha called a press conference to urge Trump to send National Guard troops to Jackson, as he did in Washington and Memphis. Standing before a podium emblazoned with a “MAKE JACKSON SAFE AGAIN” sign, Adlakha said such a move would combat violent crime. 
Andrew Scott Smith  —  The Florence resident owns a pork rinds business and calls himself the “Pigskin Politician.” He announced his bid for the U.S. Senate just hours before Hyde-Smith’s campaign launch event. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson in 2024.
Smith said he was challenging Hyde-Smith because she has become disconnected from her constituents. Smith said he considers himself a monopoly-busting conservative in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt, and he hopes to address consolidation in the American economy through index funds. He also wants to focus on the “fiscal future” of the country by phasing out Social Security and federalizing the national debt.
Democratic Primary
Scott Colom  — A native of Columbus, Colom is the elected district attorney of the 16th Circuit Court District in north Mississippi. He is the first Black person elected as the top prosecutor for the district. Then-President Joe Biden in 2023 nominated Colom to a vacant federal judicial seat in northern Mississippi, but Hyde-Smith thwarted the nomination. 
In an interview with Mississippi Today, Colom said Hyde-Smith’s voting record shows she has prioritized “D.C. politics” instead of hard-working Mississippians, including her vote for Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that slashed social safety net programs and provided tax cuts for the wealthy. 
If elected, Colom said he would push for legislation that raises the nation’s minimum wage and exempts law enforcement officers and public school teachers from paying federal income taxes. 
Mississippi Today reached out to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senate Committee for comment on the race. 
Colom is “handpicked by Chuck Schumer and George Soros to push Democrats’ radical agenda on Mississippians,” said NRSC regional press secretary Samantha Cantrell.
The Democratic committee did not respond to a request for comment.  
Priscilla Williams-Till  — The civil rights activist and relative of Emmett Till said on her campaign website that she’s running to enact laws that “will address historical and ongoing inequalities, while representing marginalized communities that work towards an equitable society.”  
“Even the election of former President Barack Obama, immigration controversy, and economic situation, it has become nearly impossible to keep track of hate organizations and the shocking rise in brutal attacks directed against individuals because they are Black, Latino, Asian, Disabled, Gay, or Women,” said Williams-Till, who grew up in Jackson.
Independent 
Ty Pinkins  — The unsuccessful Democratic candidate for secretary of state in 2023 and U.S. senator in 2024 has declared he’s also running for the Senate again in 2026 as an independent. Pinkins will be on the general election ballot without going through a primary.
Pinkins, a lawyer who lives in Vicksburg, announced his departure from the Democratic Party in June and attributed a lack of support from the state Democratic Party as part of the reason for his poor performance in past elections. Pinkins wrote that certain party leaders were “gatekeepers” who attempted to block him from advancing in politics.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22105058/AP25247764817841.jpg,,,2025-09-22 12:00:28.808608

(Photo by Daria Nipot/Getty Images)A coalition of New Hampshire-based nonprofits working on solutions to the affordability crisis in child care announced Friday that it has hired Julie Asher to serve as its inaugural executive director.
Founded in 2021, the New Hampshire Early Childhood Funders Collaborative seeks to connect philanthropic organizations as part of a mission to improve accessibility. This year the organization is working on a study to determine the full cost of providing New Hampshire children early care and education, the collaborative said in a press release. The philanthropic organizations involved include the Couch Family Foundation, the Endowment for Health, Granite United Way, New Hampshire Children’s Health Foundation, and the Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund.
Prior to joining the collaborative, Asher was a partner at Boston-based New Profit, leading the group’s Early Childhood Support Organization Initiative. She’s also worked at Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child and Silver Lining Mentoring. She’s earned degrees at Cornell University and University of California, Berkeley.
The average cost to put an infant or a toddler in center-based child care was $16,040 and $14,870 per year, respectively, in New Hampshire in 2024, according to Child Care Aware of America, which surveys child care prices nationwide. That represents 11% of the median annual income ($150,029) for a married couple and 36% of the median income ($45,086) for a single parent in New Hampshire. Additionally, research released in February from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute suggests New Hampshire businesses lost between $36 million and $56 million in 2023 because of staffing disruptions from employees forced to quit or decrease hours to take care of children. The report also found New Hampshire families lost an estimated $114 million to $178 million in earnings because they couldn’t find suitable child care.
“We are so pleased to have Julie join the Collaborative,” Patti Baum, NH ECFC member and program director at the New Hampshire Children’s Health Foundation, said in a statement. “Her knowledge and expertise will enable the Collaborative to grow our effort to strengthen the early childhood system in New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/earlycareletters-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 12:00:28.808608

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)When the South Dakota Legislature convenes for a special session Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre, lawmakers will again be asked to answer a question that’s swirled for decades: Is it time to close the oldest parts of the state penitentiary?
A “yes” would mean a green light for the most expensive capital project ever funded by the state’s taxpayers.
A “no” could drag debate on the future of the 144-year-old building known as “the Hill” into another legislative session this winter.
Either answer will ripple through a state correctional apparatus that’s been subject to increasing scrutiny for the past four years.
The stakes, the stage
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden needs two-thirds of lawmakers in each legislative chamber to approve his plan for a 1,500-bed, $650 million men’s prison in an industrial area in Sioux Falls. The state Constitution requires a two-thirds majority vote for spending bills. 
Rhoden expects to have enough funding to build the prison without taking on any debt, due to money lawmakers have put into an incarceration construction fund the past several years and interest earned on that money.
On Labor Day, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko told Rhoden she’d resign on Oct. 20. Rhoden said he supported her, but also said he understood that her decision could help the prison win the support of the lawmakers who wanted her gone.

Since then, the governor has released the prison’s layout, added answers to a prison-focused Frequently Asked Questions page and held phone calls with lawmakers to make his case. Last week, he pledged to create a rehabilitation task force if lawmakers say yes to the prison legislation, released a plan that says the prison will cost $154 million less than the one he couldn’t convince lawmakers to vote for in February, and released a letter from contractors guaranteeing a $650 million maximum price.
Ryan Brunner, an adviser to Rhoden, wrote a column addressing what he called “myths” about the project that delved into some of the same areas.
A Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Kadyn Wittman of Sioux Falls, wrote a column urging lawmakers to consider rehabilitation and new models for corrections.
Meanwhile, a cadre of state lawmakers called The Freedom Caucus pledged to oppose the prison, and at least one 2026 gubernatorial candidate — Republican Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden — has done the same. 
On Friday, the Freedom Caucus said Rhoden’s rehabilitation task force should do its work before lawmakers vote on a new prison.
Another lawmaker, former corrections secretary and Republican Rep. Tim Reisch of Howard, wrote a column backing Rhoden’s plan. Three weeks ago, he was one of 19 House members who said they no longer trusted Wasko to lead the charge for a new prison. 
Path to prison began with Noem, but discussion predates her
Rhoden’s Frequently Asked Questions page points to 2021 as the starting line for the current discussions. 
That’s the year former Gov. Kristi Noem terminated penitentiary leadership at the Department of Corrections for alleged nepotism and accusations of harassment. No one was charged criminally, but the move quickened discussions about staff shortages and operational inefficiencies at the penitentiary, which was built prior to South Dakota statehood in 1881.
Governor announces $17 million deal for Sioux Falls prison site, subject to legislative approval

Questions about the building’s age, design deficiencies and capacity predate the Noem administration, however. 
During his first stint in the governor’s office in the 1980s, Bill Janklow successfully pushed to turn the former University of South Dakota campus in Springfield into the medium security facility now known as Mike Durfee State Prison. That decision was driven in part by an order from a federal judge to deal with overcrowding at the penitentiary, but also by the lack of suitable space for lower-risk inmates.
The state added maximum and minimum security units to the Sioux Falls penitentiary’s footprint during Gov. George S. Mickelson’s time in office. Those buildings would remain in service if lawmakers opt to build a new facility. 
In 2013, then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard championed a criminal justice reform package designed, at least in part, to keep enough people out of prison and under community supervision to forestall a penitentiary replacement. 
The state’s prison population never hit the 4,500-inmate figure Daugaard warned it might without his reforms, but growth didn’t cease. By the time Noem took office, the average daily population had hit highs of 3,900 — about 200 more than the 2013 average.
After the 2021 staff shakeup, the state commissioned a facilities assessment from a firm called the DLR Group. It concluded that the penitentiary was outdated, overcrowded and needed replacing. It also called for an additional women’s prison and listed more than a dozen other facility-related needs.
Lawmakers voted to begin putting money into an incarceration construction fund in 2022, and the year after that agreed to build a medium-security women’s prison in Rapid City.
Men’s prison location sparks controversy
The new women’s prison saw little pushback. That project, with a price of $87 million, broke ground in Rapid City on Oct. 16, 2023, and is still under construction.
One of the first whiffs of trouble for the men’s prison came 10 days earlier. That’s the day the Department of Corrections announced it would transfer $8 million to the state’s Office of School and Public Lands to secure title to 320 acres of agricultural land in southern Lincoln County for what it hoped would be a 1,500-bed facility.

The land’s neighbors said they weren’t notified and had no input before the announcement. They’d soon form a nonprofit organization called Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion and sue the state in an attempt to force it to comply with local zoning rules. Its members held public meetings and testified against the project in Pierre, where lawmakers in 2024 continued putting money into the incarceration construction fund and approved spending for water and sewer infrastructure for a men’s prison.
The group of neighbors earned the backing of the lawmakers in their legislative district, including Sen. Kevin Jensen and Rep. Karla Lems, both Republicans from Canton. Lems voted against the 1,500-bed, $825 million prison on the Lincoln County site in February, contributing to a 35-35 tie that sunk the bill in the state House before it could reach the Senate. 
Jensen has said publicly that he plans to vote against the $650 million version on Tuesday.
Task force, consensus, remaining issues
Jensen’s the co-lead of a legislative summer study on recidivism, which aims to find ways to reduce the state’s inmate population by reworking prison operations and rehabilitation programs.
Lems has said that building a new prison without knowing if the state can reduce its need for beds might be “putting the cart before the horse.”
Lems, but not Jensen, served on Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset task force. That group, convened by Rhoden in the wake of the February prison vote failure, set the wheels in motion for the $650 million prison on the table this week. 
State lost $21 million on failed Lincoln County prison site, governor’s office says

The two Canton voices echo concerns raised by several other lawmakers. Among them are Wittman, the Democrat who penned an editorial about the need for a new approach to corrections.
When Rhoden announced his rehabilitation task force last Wednesday, Jensen called it overdue and poorly timed. 
Others question the need to vote this week on a prison they could revisit in three months, during the regular legislative session. Rep. Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, put himself in that camp. Last week, while saying he hadn’t made up his mind yet, he said most lawmakers are “pretty dug in” to their own positions in the run-up to the special session.
Those positions will be revealed Tuesday.
The special session begins when the Senate and House gavel in at 9 a.m. Central time. Rhoden is scheduled to deliver a speech to a joint session of both chambers at 9:30 a.m., after which debate is expected to begin. 



Timeline of prison construction planning
Following are some of the key developments in South Dakota’s recent prison construction efforts.
2021: The state Department of Corrections hires a consultant, the DLR Group, to study prison needs, resulting in a focus on the potential construction of a women’s prison to relieve overcrowding at the existing facility in Pierre, and a men’s prison to replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, which dates to 1881.
March 28, 2022: Gov. Kristi Noem signs a bill into law that creates an incarceration construction fund. She also signs an annual state budget into law that mandates a transfer of $70 million to the fund.
March 20, 2023: Noem signs a bill into law that authorizes construction of a 288-bed women’s prison in Rapid City and appropriates $60 million for it from the incarceration construction fund.
March 27, 2023: Noem signs a bill into law that authorizes planning and site preparation to build a men’s prison, appropriates $52 million for those purposes, and moves $271 million into the incarceration construction fund for future construction costs.
Oct. 6, 2023: The Noem administration announces its selection of state-owned farmland in rural Lincoln County as the site for the men’s prison, angering neighboring landowners.
Oct. 16, 2023: The state conducts a ceremonial groundbreaking for the women’s prison in Rapid City.
Nov. 3, 2023: A group calling itself Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion (NOPE) files a lawsuit in opposition to the men’s prison site in Lincoln County, alleging the project should be subject to county zoning.
March 7, 2024: Noem signs a bill into law that appropriates $2.42 million of federal funds to install water and sewer infrastructure for the construction of the women’s prison in Rapid City, and appropriates $20.89 million more for construction.
March 18, 2024: Noem signs a bill into law that appropriates $10 million of federal funds to install water and sewer infrastructure for the proposed men’s prison and transfers $226 million into the incarceration construction fund for future construction costs.
Nov. 14, 2024: The Department of Corrections tells members of the legislative budget committee that the guaranteed maximum price to build the men’s prison is $825 million.
Feb. 24, 2025: Amid rising outcry from some lawmakers about the price and location of the proposed men’s prison, a bill to authorize its construction, to transfer $182 million to the incarceration construction fund, and to appropriate $763 million from the fund for construction fails on a 35-35 vote in the state House of Representatives.
Feb. 27, 2025: Gov. Larry Rhoden, who was elevated in January 2025 when Gov. Noem departed to serve in the Trump Cabinet, appoints a Project Prison Reset task force, led by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, to restart a study of the need, potential locations and cost to build a men’s prison.
July 8, 2025: The Project Prison Reset task force, after a series of public meetings, unanimously recommends construction of a men’s prison with a $650 million budget at one of two vacant plots of industrial land in northeast Sioux Falls.
July 9, 2025: The state Supreme Court rules against opponents to the Lincoln County prison site in their lawsuit, saying they can’t force the state to abide by county zoning laws. The decision has no practical effect on the project since state officials have already ruled out the site in favor of two potential locations in Sioux Falls.
Aug. 8, 2025: Gov. Rhoden announces a potential $17 million deal to acquire land for a new men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls and trade away the state-owned land 15 miles south of the city that was formerly selected as a prison site in Lincoln County.
Sept. 2, 2025: Kellie Wasko, secretary of the Department of Corrections, delivers a letter to Gov. Rhoden saying she’ll resign Oct. 20. The move is viewed as potentially positive for the prison construction plan, because some lawmakers included complaints about Wasko’s leadership in their opposition to the proposal.
Sept. 18, 2025: Gov. Rhoden’s office releases information indicating that $21 million of the money spent to acquire, study and prepare the Lincoln County site for construction is unrecoverable if legislators move on to the Sioux Falls site.
Sept. 23, 2025: The Legislature convenes for a special session at the Capitol in Pierre to consider a bill that would authorize the Department of Corrections to contract for construction of a men’s prison, to trade away the former site in Lincoln County as part of a deal to buy the new site in Sioux Falls, to transfer $78 million from the general fund to the incarceration construction fund, and to appropriate $650 million from the incarceration construction fund for the purchase of the land and construction costs. The anticipated funding includes $24 million in interest earned by the incarceration construction fund during the current fiscal year and $42 million in projected future interest.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/South-Dakota-State-Penitentiary-e1677103776868-1024x637.jpg,,,2025-09-22 10:57:31.835883

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Larry Rhoden’s opponents should probably hope he doesn’t get his way Tuesday when he asks the Legislature to approve his $650 million prison construction plan.
If the legislation passes, it’ll be another big win for the Republican governor in only eight months on the job.
Whether you agree with Rhoden and his policies or not, he’s proven surprisingly effective at resolving disputes and achieving his goals, and at making himself look like a contender in next year’s election.
When Gov. Kristi Noem departed in January to join President Donald Trump’s Cabinet and Lt. Gov. Rhoden was elevated to governor, Rhoden was viewed as a seat-warmer. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson was expected to easily thwart him in the June 2026 primary.

That scenario would echo the history of 1993-1994, when Republican Gov. George Mickelson died in a plane crash and Lt. Gov. Walter Dale Miller took over, only to lose in the primary to the better-known Bill Janklow (who served four years as attorney general, 16 as governor and one in Congress).
Rhoden is perfectly cast as the new Miller, not only because of the situation both were thrust into and the subordinate role they were expected to play. Miller, who died in 2015, was also a former legislator like Rhoden, was from the same county as Rhoden, was a rancher like Rhoden, and wore a cowboy hat and boots like Rhoden.
Although Miller’s political career ended with his loss to Janklow, being the next Miller might not be so bad, thanks to a bit of trivia that’s been obscured by Janklow’s outsized place in state history: Miller only lost to Janklow by 8 points in 1994.
When South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy released their poll about the 2026 governor’s race in April, Johnson’s lead over Rhoden was 1 point. Since then, Johnson has continued adding to his intimidating pile of campaign cash, which stood at about $7 million as of the most recent filing deadlines for campaign finance reports. Rhoden hasn’t had to file a new report since becoming governor, and there are questions about his ability to gain traction with donors.
Yet Rhoden keeps getting things done.
After taking over in January and applying a reset (his word) to every mess (my word) his predecessor left behind, Rhoden has been wrestling political problems to the ground like rodeo steers. The biggest of those are the three P’s — a pipeline, property taxes and prison construction.
Special session could resolve or inflame years of debate about SD’s pre-statehood penitentiary

The controversial Summit Carbon Pipeline proposal was tearing the state Republican Party apart when Rhoden came into office. He signed a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines into law and put the issue to bed, at least for a while.
Rising homeowner property taxes bedeviled legislators for years before Rhoden became governor, but nobody had come up with a workable response. He needed less than two months to propose, shepherd through the legislative process and sign a bill designed to slow the increases.
Noem left behind a wreck of a prison construction plan, with a site under litigation and a revolt from legislators who didn’t like the price or the location in rural Lincoln County. Rhoden appointed his lieutenant governor, Tony Venhuizen, to lead a task force that came up with a new plan, a lower price and a different location in Sioux Falls for legislators to consider Tuesday.
Rhoden hasn’t declared himself a candidate to keep his job yet, but he has a campaign website and is traveling the state on an “Open for Opportunity” tour that’s really an extended, state-funded campaign trip.
Johnson has won nine statewide races including primaries and general elections, and he’s not likely to be outworked in a campaign. There are other announced Republican candidates — Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, who was at 4% in the April poll, and state House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, at 2% — who could make up ground or play the role of spoiler in the primary.
A Trump endorsement for any of them would probably be a clincher. Failing that, Rhoden’s best hope is completing a successful audition for the job.
Those are the stakes for Rhoden on Tuesday, when he could clean up another Noem mess and rack up another political and policy win, or suffer a setback of his own making.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) at a campaign event for JD Vance in Shelby Twp. on Aug. 7, 2024. | Lucy ValeskiU.S. Rep. John James’ bid for governor in 2026, which has positioned itself as the frontrunner in the race, was knocked down a peg over the weekend after the campaign came in fourth among declared gubernatorial contenders in a Michigan Republican Party poll.
Members of the Michigan’s GOP, from leaders to delegates and activists, gathered this past weekend on Mackinac Island for a biannual conference that allows candidates for governor and other offices to make a splash. The affair typically includes speakers and seminars, this year featuring U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump acolyte Ric Grenell, who serves as president of the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.
The event also featured a gubernatorial forum with declared candidates and those on the cusp of potentially joining the race – of which James was absent, according to The Detroit News.
The Michigan Information & Research Service Inc., known as MIRS, reported that James, of Shelby Township, and his campaign were also missing from a cavalcade of candidates and their supporters greeting Republicans as they made their way to the island.

Making matters potentially worse was the outcome of the straw poll, organized by conservative news outlet The Midwesterner. The poll sampled nearly 500 registered attendees at the event.
Results of the poll shared on social media showed Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township on top of the GOP gubernatorial primary field with 29% of votes cast. Former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard came in second with 23.5%; former Attorney General Mike Cox with 18.5%; and James in fourth with just 14% of votes cast.
Pastor Ralph Rebandt, who recently announced his candidacy and made a play for governor in 2022, came in fifth place with 5% in the poll, while activist Karla Wagner came in sixth place with just under 5%.
Candidate Anthony Hudson garnered just 0.8%, while other names floated by attendees for the poll got a collective 4.4%.
James remained positive about his race and his standing as the largest name among primary contenders, Gongwer News Service reported, but a Washington Examiner piece published over the weekend spelled potential consternation over James’ candidacy and its potential to upend the GOP’s stronghold in Congress.
Rep. John James joins race for Michigan governor, says state lacks “strong, competent leadership.”

U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain of Bruce Township told the latter conservative outlet it was “100% not ideal” that James was leaving behind his Michigan 10th Congressional District seat in pursuit of the governor’s office. McClain said the situation makes it difficult for the GOP to hold its two-seat majority in 2026. McClain later doubled down by saying that James was “absolutely” jeopardizing Republican control of his seat by running for governor.
That said, McClain was upbeat about the candidates that could come forward soon to declare in that race. Robert Llgjuraj is the only Republican who has officially thrown his hat in the ring.
An open seat would cost more money to defend and would require the GOP to spend that money on a new face, whereas it would be easier if James remained in the race, McClain added.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0364-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 10:57:31.835883

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The commission leading Maine’s commemoration of the country’s 250th anniversary has launched a new grant program to support local celebrations of the Pine Tree State’s role in that history. 
The Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, which is chaired by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and coordinates educational and historical events in honor of the anniversary, announced the new program Monday. The grants will be funded by the Maine State Archives and the Maine State Cultural Affairs Council.
The commission will offer grants of up to $10,000 to communities, organizations and institutions to do community-centered research, events or other projects such as museum exhibitions that commemorate Maine’s past or anticipate its future. 
“Mainers are great storytellers, and I expect we will see some memorable and poignant projects result from this grant program,” said Commission Director Sarah Hansen.
“This is an opportunity for groups of all types and from across the state to share Maine’s stories and reflect on Maine’s unique and impactful role in shaping the history of our nation.”
The funding does not require any match or cost sharing; however, groups must submit an application by Oct. 31. Applicants will be notified by Dec. 15, if they have been selected to receive a grant. More details about the application can be found on the commission’s website.
These efforts are in anticipation for the 250th anniversary of signing the Declaration of Independence, which will fall on July 4, 2026.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s high court has confirmed an unprecedented decision by the state Board of Chiropractic Examiners to revoke a license issued to a Fairbanks chiropractor.
The Alaska Supreme Court published its decision Friday, overruling a lower court decision in the process. Writing for the court, which ruled unanimously, Justice Dario Borghesan said that “the troubling facts of this case gave the board a reasonable basis to impose the most severe sanction of complete license revocation.”
Aaron Shoemaker, who received an Alaska chiropractic physician license in 2017, began practicing in Fairbanks in 2018 and opened his own practice, called Advanced Chiropractic. 
In 2022, the state regulatory board revoked his license after accusations of a variety of misconduct including sexually touching a client during a massage, refusing to follow mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, and “being convicted of crimes demonstrating unfitness for practice.”
In June 2020, Shoemaker, then 36, was arrested by Alaska State Troopers after stealing a road compactor and posting images of the theft on his practice’s Facebook page. Court records say he was exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis, and after his arrest he was briefly committed to a psychiatric facility. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for the crime.
The Board of Chiropractic Examiners temporarily suspended Shoemaker’s license in September 2020, and after an administrative hearing, permanently revoked his license a year and a half later.
Shoemaker appealed that decision to Fairbanks Superior Court, which ruled in Shoemaker’s favor in September 2023. The board then appealed the case to the Alaska Supreme Court.
Borghesan, writing on behalf of the state’s highest court, said the board did not abuse its discretion by revoking Shoemaker’s license.
The justice wrote that there was a reasonable basis for the board to rule that Shoemaker’s misdemeanor conviction demonstrated his unfitness, and there was substantial evidence to conclude that Shoemaker “attempted sexual contact” with a patient, in violation of ethical standards.
Borghesan also wrote that there was substantial evidence that Shoemaker violated professional standards by failing to follow the state’s COVID mask mandate during the pandemic emergency.
In a footnote, Borghesan scolded Superior Court Judge Thomas Temple for relying on an opinion column submitted by Shoemaker and ruling that Shoemaker had a reasonable basis to ignore masking rules.
“The sole issue facing the superior court was whether there was substantial evidence to support the board’s finding that … Shoemaker did not wear a mask when treating patients. … it was the board’s role — not the court’s — to weigh and draw inferences from the evidence,” he wrote.

Chellie Pingree hands out red roses to demonstrators at the No Kings demonstration in York, Maine. “People are angry, they want to know what to do, want to do something, they want to fight back,” she said. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree has received several reports that attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-in visits at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Maine. 
In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday, Pingree requested confirmation of whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if it does, its legal justification. 
“Should this policy exist, it raises significant questions about transparency and the right to representation,” Pingree wrote. “I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only state-wide immigration legal services organization, and officials of the town of Scarborough, the location of ICE’s Maine field office, first reached out to Pingree’s office about this issue on Aug. 13. Now, Pingree said on a press call Monday afternoon, it “appears to be a growing trend.” 
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project confirmed to Maine Morning Star that its clients have been denied the right to have their attorneys present at appointments at the field office over the past few months, including during check-in appointments for people who are in immigration court proceedings. Arrests at such proceedings have been reported elsewhere across the country. 
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

“In the current environment, with the federal government flagrantly disregarding due process and attempting to indiscriminately deport as many people as they can, having your attorney by your side during any ICE appointment is beyond critical,” Executive Director Sue Roche said in a statement.  
Pingree, a Democrat, also formally requested a tour of the Scarborough facility in her letter, writing that local town officials have been denied entry after they raised concerns. 
“Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely,” Pingree wrote. “Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”
Pingree requested a written response to her letter within 30 days. She emphasized in her letter that providing casework and acting as an intermediary to executive agencies is one of the most fundamental services Congress provides to constituents. 
“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation — as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” Pingree wrote. 
During the press call, Pingree, who represents Maine’s first district, said that her office routinely meets with asylees in her district who have a variety of questions related to immigration status. 
“We get maybe five walk-ins a day, dozens of calls during the week, on everything from the slow response on getting their work permits, which they’re legally allowed, to problems people have with their green card or family reunification,” Pingree said. “And, now, increasingly, we’re hearing from people who literally can’t find their family member.”
Movement during immigration detention is common and, as immigration attorneys previously told Maine Morning Star, it creates chaos and makes it more difficult for legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch. People are often detained under ICE orders in local jails and then transferred out of state.

Today, he studies environmental and agricultural reform throughout the world, and he sees a need for a cultural shift in the way humans think about their place in the world. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — University of Kansas professor and attorney John Head grinned wryly as he summarized the possibility of agricultural and environmental reforms.
“It’s not pretty from my perspective, but it is promising,” he said on the Kansas Reflector podcast.
Head’s background growing up on a farm in northeast Missouri underpins the way he approaches research on legal aspects of the international environmental crisis.
He also spent decades working in international business law. Before entering the academic world, Head worked on treaties, human rights and international economic affairs through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.


In the past 15 years, he turned to studying international environmental law.
“What I have seen is that although there have been increasing crop yields and more precision farming, more sophistication technologically and all of that, there’s also been a departure from a kind of natural systems approach to farming,” Head said.
That is where he sees the promise — research today that supports a return to natural systems approaches, which include reducing inputs and shifting from annual to perennial crops, he said.
The “not pretty” part of what is happening today, he said, is continuing environmental degradation.
“There is a soils (degradation) crisis. There are also other crises, environmental crises, that I think contemporary conventional agriculture contributes to, and those are the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis,” Head said. “All of those have trajectories that are — well, to say they’re troubling would be a gentle and deep understatement.”
Although researchers worldwide are looking at agricultural reform, the lack of desire to tackle environmental protections makes change difficult, partly because of economic considerations, Head said.
“But also political changes are not very amenable to the types of agricultural reform that I think are promising and possible,” he said.
Ultimately, people need to reconsider their place in nature and let go of beliefs that they are dominant over the natural world, Head said.
In an article recently published as part of a University of Missouri-Kansas City Law Review symposium, Head dove into the topic of global environmental crises.
“I explain in the following pages why I believe that in facing global environmental crises, our species should reconceptualize its place in nature,” he said in the article. “Specifically, we should reject, or at least radically modify, a cluster of closely-held beliefs and world-views, including the anthropocentric perspective that regards humans as outside of nature or in control of nature.”
Redefining how we, as humans, think of nature is necessary, he said.
“The main point there, and it’s not original, of course, with me … is to try to make a shift away from having humans consider themselves dominant in nature and somehow entitled to be dominant in nature, with very little attention to the needs of not only other species, but the whole systems, the natural systems that create the home, that create Earth as a living planet,” Head said.
Much has been written in international law about intergenerational equity, Head said, related to the concept common in many Indigenous cultures that one should plan or look forward for seven generations.
An example would be when Wes Jackson, co-founder of the Land Institute in Salina, and environmental activist Wendell Berry put forward the idea of creating a 50-year farm bill in an opinion article in 2009 in the New York Times.
“There is no way that under the political system or the political environment in which Wes and Wendell were writing or the political environment today that that sort of forward planning would be taken up and dealt with, but I think the forward planning is necessary nonetheless,” Head said.
Such a dramatic cultural shift is possible, although the likelihood of such change is a different topic, he said. He pointed to precedents of major cultural changes, often made in the face of great trauma or during emergencies.
“In climate literature, for instance, there’s an analogy often drawn to World War II and the mobilization of economic power, of personal sacrifice in the United States and other places, as well, which were invaded, such as Great Britain, in order to rise to the occasion,” he said.
After the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, an editorial in Le Monde, a French newspaper, said “we are all Americans today,” Head said.
That recognition of interconnectedness, however, does not seem likely with the current state of the world, he said.
“But the problem, it seems to me, and the reason that certainly in this country, in this year, the likelihood is small for having a cultural change be triggered and implemented, is that there’s not the recognition,” Head said. “And in fact, there is an anti-recognition, if that can be a word, because we see in the federal government, in many aspects, a sort of a closing down of information, removal of website information, dismantling of weather service personnel, and a change in the U.S. Department of Agriculture in terms of assistance for farmers.”
The refusal to recognize the crises that are occurring in the environment doesn’t mean the world shouldn’t be preparing, Head said. Systems can be planned and research continued on ways to introduce natural farming practices, and when the political winds shift, new approaches can be ready to go, he said.
“This is a globalized world,” he said. “There’s no denying that now. So if you have a global crisis — climate crisis, soils crisis, biodiversity crisis — it’s impossible, in my view, to deal with that other than in a global fashion, with international multilateral efforts.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/John-Head-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 09:57:46.850222

“As a civil rights advocate and the son of a small business owner, I know the barriers entrepreneurs face in the marketplace,” said Kreuzer in a press release. “Supporting workers and supporting industry are not mutually exclusive. I’ll fight to ensure workers’ financial needs are met while also providing resources to help businesses thrive.”
The district is currently held by State Sen. Mark Huizenga (R-Walker), who defeated former State Rep. David LaGrand – now the mayor of Grand Rapids – in a close 2022 election, receiving 405 more votes. Huizenga is seeking reelection.
The seat will likely serve as a battleground in 2026 as Senate Republicans look to take control of the chamber, where Democrats presently hold a slim 19-18 majority. 
Also in the race for the Democratic nomination is State Rep. Carol Glanville (D-Walker), who announced her candidacy last week.
Kreuzer outlined priorities including increasing affordable housing supply through sustainable development, investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and fostering collaborative, inclusive communities.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Cari Medina and Anestine Bentick







MASSACHUSETTS’S FRONTLINE HEALTH care workers – doctors, nurses, medical assistants, home health aides, hospital technicians – are watching their profession buckle under worsening pressure. Existing critical staff shortages are colliding with new uncertainties around immigration enforcement and hospital closures, complicating health workers’ efforts to provide care and seek it themselves. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talked with 1199SEIU Massachusetts Executive Vice President Cari Medina and Anestine Bentick, lead medical assistant at South Boston Community Health. The conversation is part of CommonWealth Beacon’s health care access month and its special “Critical Condition” coverage.  
The 1199SEIU represents over 85,000 frontline caregivers in Massachusetts hospitals, nursing homes, homecare, clinics, pharmacies, and areas of the healthcare industry. Many of them are women, people of color, and immigrants.  
The second Trump administration began with a flood of executive actions aimed at reducing the number of immigrants in the United States. Ongoing attempts to revoke Temporary Protected Status – which provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters, or other “extraordinary and temporary” conditions and lets the immigrants apply for temporary work permits — could worsen shortages in home health aides. 
The feeling in the centers is “horrible,” Bentick said. “I had a couple of our co-workers who are Haitian. They were asked to leave because of their status. We were one of the health centers that provided care for most of our Haitian patients, and they’re no longer here because of what is happening.” 
Ramped up immigration enforcement actions are also impacting people’s willingness to seek care.  
“No one wants to come in to keep their appointments, because they heard rumors that ICE was in the neighborhood, which they were,” she said. “That’s really frustrating because we have the most vulnerable patients here in the health center in our community. And it’s very sad that they’re not going to keep their appointment because they’re afraid.” 
Centers like Bentik’s are already trying to do more with less, she said, building out their staff with younger and temporary workers like co-op students while dealing with an increased patient load because of the Carney Hospital closure. 
Medina said closings and uncertainty around the Steward Health Care system bankruptcy were an immediate shock to a health care workforce already dealing with high rates of burnout and staff shortages.  
“The communities were devastated,” Medina said, with a “lack of care, no access, especially in rural Neshoba.”  
The impacts were twofold, Medina said. “Career-long” health care jobs vanished from the region, with the union hurrying to find its members positions in other hospitals.  
“But more importantly, it’s scary because patients have to seek care so far away,” Medina said. “Just even getting prescriptions filled or having a regular doctor’s appointment is a struggle.” 
On the episode, Medina and Bentick describe existing pressures on stretched workforces (1:00), bracing for Medicaid changes (18:28), and how immigration policy bleeds into the health care space (10:00).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 09:57:46.850222

That’s when Californians will be asked to vote yes or no on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional districts in a way that would increase the odds of Democrats’ gaining five seats in the House of Representatives. It’s the governor’s bid to offset a Republican gambit in Texas to gerrymander five seats in favor of Republicans.To help you make a decision on how to cast your ballot, we have a special edition of our Voter Guide out today to help you understand Proposition 50, the lone statewide item you’ll be voting on in seven weeks. 
California voters approved ballot measures in 2008 and 2010 to model less-partisan redistricting behavior for the rest of the country. Several other states followed, but most still stick to the process of having state lawmakers draw maps in a partisan fashion at the close of every decennial census.Enter Texas and Donald Trump. The president, fearing that the slim Republican majority in the House will disappear at the midterm elections next year, asked Texas GOP leaders to redraw their congressional maps this year to increase the odds more Republicans are elected. Texas delivered. So, Newsom and the supermajority of Democrats in the Legislature put together Prop. 50 to suspend the state’s independent redistricting commission until 2030 to try to neutralize what Texas did.Already $90 million in campaign spending has poured into this ballot measure. So far, two polls show Californians are gearing up to approve Prop 50, though many are still undecided.  Learn more from the guide here.

California is known for wonky policy fights that generate big bucks in campaign spending and lobbying. We’re not talking about labor battles or dialysis, though. Today’s edition is about the gambling wars. 
Earlier this month, lawmakers approved a bill backed by casino-operating Native American tribes that would hurt their competitors. Assembly Bill 831 would ban the sweepstakes prizes gaming companies offer to encourage their players to buy more coins in online games, reports CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
The gaming companies say what they offer is safe and isn’t gambling. These games are expected to generate $8 billion in revenue, a legislative analysis said.
The groups backing and fighting this bill spent $1.7 million on lobbying this year.Newsom’s deadline to veto or sign the bill is Oct. 12.

Newsom takes a stand; Trump tightens H1Bs

Newsom signed a slate of laws on Saturday to bolster the state’s position as leader of the Trump resistance, including a contentious bill to prohibit federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks, with some exceptions. The bill raises constitutional questions about states’ abilities to restrict federal operations, report CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich and Jeanne Kuang. 
Other new laws bar schools and hospitals from allowing federal immigration agents from entering unless those officers show a warrant. 
In other immigration-related news, Trump declared last Friday that he’s seeking to increase the price of an H-1B visa from a few hundred dollars to $100,000 for new applicants. These are visas for international workers with at least a bachelor’s degree. California, led by its tech sector, is the largest recipient of these workers.Views on the visa cross party lines. Some say the visas promote U.S. innovation by staffing hard-to-fill positions, including at universities. Others contend the visas permit companies to pursue relatively cheaper labor, limiting otherwise good-paying jobs to U.S. workers — a claim held by the Trump administration. 
Banks and tech companies remain confused about Trump’s visa plans.

Jacqueline Arthur, head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, in a Saturday memo to employees: “We acknowledge that this is an uncertain time for our people on H-1B visas and your families.” 




And lastly: Most expensive CalPERS election, ever





California unions are in disagreement and spending heavily in an election at CalPERS, the pension fund that provides retirement benefits to 2 million people. Public employee unions are typically the only groups that spend money on this, but this time the mostly private-sector trades are weighing in to support an alternative. Now they’re at odds and backing rival candidates. Learn why from CalMatters’ Adam Ashton and Jeremia Kimelman.






California Voices
As election day nears, we have two different views on redistricting:

Former redistricting commissioner Trena Turner argues that the costs of not backing Prop. 50 outweigh any other costs.
Jeanne Raya was the chair of California’s first independent redistricting commission. She says Newsom’s attempt at redistricting is an overreach.

What will California look like in 25 years, when it celebrates 200 years of statehood, wonders D.J. Waldie, former Lakewood deputy city manager and essayist. Our troubles with housing and water will likely persist. Whatever it’ll be, “Californians need to accept the burdens of their history and shape their aspirations accordingly,” he writes.

State authorities are scrambling to grapple with widespread use of artificial intelligence.,"In summary
The court of appeals said 21 of 23 quotes in an opening brief were fake. State authorities are scrambling to grapple with widespread use of artificial intelligence.


A California attorney must pay a $10,0000 fine for filing a state court appeal full of fake quotations generated by the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT.
The fine appears to be the largest issued over AI fabrications by a California court and came with a blistering opinion stating that 21 of 23 quotes from cases cited in the attorney’s opening brief were made up. It also noted that numerous out-of-state and federal courts have confronted attorneys for citing fake legal authority.
“We therefore publish this opinion as a warning,” it continued. “Simply stated, no brief, pleading, motion, or any other paper filed in any court should contain any citations— whether provided by generative AI or any other source—that the attorney responsible for submitting the pleading has not personally read and verified.”
The opinion, issued 10 days ago in California’s 2nd District Court of Appeal, is a clear example of why the state’s legal authorities are scrambling to regulate the use of AI in the judiciary. The state’s Judicial Council two weeks ago issued guidelines requiring judges and court staff to either ban generative AI or adopt a generative AI use policy by Dec. 15. Meanwhile, the California Bar Association is considering whether to strengthen its code of conduct to account for various forms of AI following a request by the California Supreme Court last month.
The Los Angeles-area attorney fined last week, Amir Mostafavi, told the court that he did not read text generated by the AI model before submitting the appeal in July 2023, months after OpenAI marketed ChatGPT as capable of passing the bar exam. A three-judge panel fined him for filing a frivolous appeal, violating court rules, citing fake cases, and wasting the court’s time and the taxpayers money, according to the opinion.
Mostafavi told CalMatters he wrote the appeal, and then used ChatGPT to try and improve it. He said that he didn’t know it would add case citations or make things up. 
He thinks it is unrealistic to expect lawyers to stop using AI. It’s become an important tool just as online databases largely replaced law libraries, and until AI systems stop hallucinating fake information, he suggests lawyers who use AI to proceed with caution.
“In the meantime we’re going to have some victims, we’re going to have some damages, we’re going to have some wreckages,” he said. “I hope this example will help others not fall into the hole. I’m paying the price.”
The fine issued to Mostafavi is the most costly penalty issued to an attorney by a California state court and one of the highest fines ever issued over attorney use of  AI, according to Damien Charlotin, who teaches a class on AI and the law at a business school in Paris. He tracks instances of attorneys citing fake cases primarily in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
In a widely-publicized case in May, a U.S. district court judge in California ordered two law firms to pay $31,100 in fees to defense counsel and the court for costs associated with using “bogus AI-generated research.” In that ruling, the judge described feeling misled, said they almost cited fake material in a judicial order, and said “Strong deterrence is needed to make sure that attorneys don’t succumb to this easy shortcut.”
“We’re going to have some wreckages.”Amir Mostafavi, lawyer fined $10,000 after submitting opening brief filled with quotes fabricated by ChatGPT
Charlotin thinks courts and the public should expect to see an exponential rise in these cases in the future. When he started tracking court filings involving AI and fake cases earlier this year, he encountered a few cases a month. Now he sees a few cases a day. Large language models confidently state falsehoods as facts, particularly when there are no supporting facts.
“The harder your legal argument is to make, the more the model will tend to hallucinate, because they will try to please you,” he said. “That’s where the confirmation bias kicks in.”
A May 2024 analysis by Stanford University’s RegLab found that although three out of four lawyers plan to use generative AI in their practice, some forms of AI generate hallucinations in one out of three queries. Detecting fake material cited in legal filings could get harder as models grow in size.
Another tracker of cases where lawyers cite nonexistent legal authority due to use of AI identifies 52 such cases in California and more than 600 nationwide. That amount is expected to increase in the near future because AI innovation is outpacing the education of attorneys, said Nicholas Sanctis, a law student at Capital University Law School in Ohio.
Jenny Wondracek, who leads the tracker project, said she expects this trend to get worse because she still regularly encounters lawyers who don’t know that AI makes things up or believe that legal tech tools can eliminate all fake or false material generated by language models. 
“I think we’d see a reduction if (lawyers) just understood the basics of the technology,” she said.
Like Charlotin, she suspects there are more instances of made up cases generated by AI in state court filings than in federal courts, but a lack of standard filing methods makes it difficult to verify that. She said she encounters fake cases most often among overburdened attorneys or people who choose to represent themselves in family court.
She suspects the number of arguments filed by attorneys that use AI and cite fake cases will continue to go up, but added that not just attorneys engage in the practice. In recent weeks, she’s documented three instances of judges citing fake legal authority in their decisions.
She’s documented three judges citing fake legal authority in their decisions.
As California considers how to treat generative AI and fake case citations, Wondracek said they can consider approaches taken by other states, such as temporary suspensions, requiring attorneys who get caught to take courses to better understand how to ethically use AI, or requiring them to teach law students how they can avoid making the same mistake.
Mark McKenna, codirector of the UCLA Institute of Technology, Law & Policy praised fines like the one against Mostafavi as punishing lawyers for “an abdication of your responsibility as a party representing someone.” He thinks the problem “will get worse before it gets better,” because there’s been a rush among law schools and private firms to adopt AI without thinking through the appropriate way to use them.
UCLA School of Law professor Andrew Selbst agrees, pointing out that clerks that work for judges are recent law school graduates, and students are getting bombarded with the message that they must use AI or get left behind. Educators and other professionals report feeling similar pressures.
“This is getting shoved down all our throats,” he said. “It’s being pushed in firms and schools and a lot of places and we have not yet grappled with the consequences of that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10092023_CARE-Court_AH_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

Waldie,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/imagine-california-life-bicentennial-2050/,What California will be in its bicentennial year of 2050 is subject to unpredictable conditions.,"Guest Commentary written by

D.J. Waldie
D.J. Waldie is an essayist, memoirist, translator and editor. He previously served as a deputy city manager of Lakewood. His most recent book is “Elements of Los Angeles: Earth, Water, Air, Fire.”


One hundred and seventy-five years ago, our state was the prize in an unjust war whose aim was to extend slavery beyond the plantations of the South to the valleys of California. Fifty years later, those valleys were dominated by corporate agriculture (wheat, cattle, cotton and oranges) and controlled politically by railroad interests. By 1950, the future of California was in the hands of real estate developers. The valleys filled with houses and then with all of us — believers in the golden dream and disillusioned hustlers alike. At the start of a new millennium in 2000, the dreamers still arrived. Not from “back east” but from the Global South and the Asian “far west.” Developers still turned square miles of farmland into tract house suburbia. Big, old-style corporations came and went. New technologies boomed and sometimes busted, but overall, the momentum in the systems of industry, finance and labor that defined California in the mid-20th century had slowed. 
What California will be in its bicentennial year of 2050 is subject to unpredictable conditions. The nation becomes ungovernable; the San Andreas rips; drought worsens in the Colorado River watershed; AI-driven technologies deliver worst-case scenarios: social isolation, broken economies, accidental war. 
Absent these shocks, continuities will dominate California’s tomorrows. Demographic trends underway since 1990 will persist. Californians will be older, with a median age of nearly 42, up from a median age of 38 in 2025. Nearly one-quarter of us will be over 65, troubling the state’s image of youthful hedonism as well as the job market. Ethnic and political sorting will continue to send more Californians to red states and bring immigrants — in fewer numbers — to change the makeup of the political and civic organizations through which power is channeled. By 2050, nearly 50% of us will have Latino roots. The percentage of white non-Latinos will drift down to 25%. This realignment will likely bring a California-style Latino populism that disrupts conventional blue/red political binaries. 
1950s California — young, better educated, risk-taking — excelled at turning Cold War defense spending into new industries and the shiny consumer products that defined a better tomorrow. When defense spending contracted in the 1990s, university researchers and hedge fund managers propelled newer and faster technological advances. The qualities that made California uniquely a leader in innovation are less obvious now, and the global competition is stiffer. 
Forgotten are the cycles of drought that unmade the state’s cattle economy in the mid-19th century and drove titanic projects in the 20th century to bring water to places with little of their own. By 2050, we’ll use the water we have better through wastewater recycling, stormwater capture, limits on groundwater extraction, and agriculture fitted to a harsher climate regime. 
But there will always be too little water in the southern half of the state. Fundamental ecological divides — north vs. south, coast vs. inland, temperate upland forest vs. dry chaparral lowland — will still fragment the California landscape and define Californians’ unique sense of place.
The costs of a California lifestyle — particularly the cost of housing — will widen the gap between households at the top and the low- and middle-income families below. Without new and creative housing programs, less than one-third of Californians will be able to finance a median-priced home. 
Sharp differences in the quality of life between one community and another — begun by redlining neighborhoods in the 1930s — will persist. The conditions that predispose some Californians to become homeless aren’t likely to improve very much, although there may be fewer unsheltered people asleep on city streets. 
Meanwhile, corporate refugees will follow the headquarters of Oracle, Northrop Grumman and Chevron out of the state, along with new technology billionaires and their enclaves of unimaginable privilege.
The challenge for Californians in 2050 will be one of imagination: to see themselves as inheritors of a compromised but still resourceful California.
Popular movements for equity and social justice are maturing. Political initiatives for health care, education, infrastructure renewal, homelessness and housing affordability could follow. The dark magic of AI is a threat to middle-income and low-wage earners, but it could become a platform to deepen our understanding of the environment and improve educational outcomes. A state with too many unaccountable boards, commissions and special districts and too many local governments jealous of their prerogatives could learn the hard lesson that a better future will come from regional coordination — in providing law enforcement, overseeing water management, responding to natural and human caused disasters and planning for economic development.
Californians need to accept the burdens of their history and shape their aspirations accordingly. They need to imagine a different kind of California, a California of shared potential, recognizing what had been lost or squandered in becoming Californian and understanding clearly what Californians can still achieve. 
As hard as it will be to realize, the California we deserve is possible.

How one college is faring,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/09/minority-student-funding-california/,"As the U.S. Department of Education cuts back on grants to colleges and universities that serve Latino, Asian, Black and Native American students, California will lose millions — including money that will soon get sent to other institutions in swing states and states that voted for Trump in 2024.","In summary
As the U.S. Department of Education cuts back on grants to colleges and universities that serve Latino, Asian, Black and Native American students, California will lose millions — including money that will soon get sent to other institutions in swing states and states that voted for Trump in 2024.


In a few weeks, over 100 colleges and universities across California will lose access to essential funding for tutoring, academic counseling and other support services aimed at helping Black, Latino, Asian and Native American students succeed in college. 
The change comes after the U.S. Department of Education said earlier this month that it was ending a grant program that supports “minority-serving institutions,” claiming that it illegally favors certain racial or ethnic groups. 
Every state will lose money, but the Education Department’s decision hits California hardest. The state receives over a quarter of all of these diversity grants, since it has a high percentage of minority students, especially Latinos, and it has more college campuses than any other state.  
The state’s community college system could lose $20 million next year as a result of the funding cuts, said Chris Ferguson, who supports finance and strategic relations at the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office. The Cal State University and the University of California systems, which also receive this money, did not respond to questions about the amount of funding at risk.
Laney College, located just a few blocks from Oakland’s Chinatown and Little Saignon, has used these federal grants for the past 15 years to run the Asian Pacific American Student Success center on campus, helping students improve their English, build community and find work. 
At the end of the month, David Lee, its longtime director, will lose his job. “It’s like a gut punch,” he said, standing in his basement office, which doubles as the Asian student center.  All around him are signs of his legacy — posters on the wall from various campus events, photos of students and staff who treat the center as a second home. 
After CalMatters reached out to the college about the future of the student center, Laney College’s Vice President of Student Services Lily Espinoza sent an email to faculty, saying that the space will continue to be available to students after Lee leaves, although with fewer staff to support it.
Of California’s 116 community colleges, 22 California State University campuses, and 10 UC campuses, about two-thirds receive these diversity grants. Colleges that receive these grants get to decide how they use the money to support students. The grants max out at about $600,000 per school per year. 
Laney College gets much less than that, though. Lee said the school’s federal grant, about $300,000 a year, supports his salary, the salary of up to three part-time counselors and various expenses for events. The state also provides some money, and the college grants access to the basement office and community space for free.

The center is next to the boiler, which emits a loud humming noise for hours each day. A slanted pole runs through the middle of it, hiding wires and breaking up the space, which can only accommodate a few students at a time. 
Still, Lee is proud of the program and the impact it has had. “There’s a lot of history here,” he said. “We’re the only center serving Asian students in Peralta.” Last year, roughly 5,500 Asian students attended one of the four schools in the Peralta Community College District, which includes Laney College, according to state data.
In his budget for next year, which was released in May, President Trump proposed expanding  this federal grant program, known as “minority-serving institutions” grants, but he didn’t say why.  Both Republicans and Democrats have long supported the program, especially those who represent states with large Latino populations such as California, Texas and Florida.
But Trump’s support for the program didn’t last long. In June, the attorney general for Tennessee and a legal advocacy group, Students for Fair Admissions, sued the U.S. Department of Education, claiming that the grant program was discriminatory. In July, the Department of Justice, which is representing the Education Department in the case, told the judge it would not defend against the lawsuit, saying grants to certain minority-serving institutions violate the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on discrimination.  
The Education Department reiterated that reasoning with its decision last week to stop funding minority-serving institutions.  
But some minority-serving institutions, namely historically Black colleges and tribal colleges, are exempt from the department’s decision. McMahon said last week that she’ll use the money that’s earmarked for minority-serving institutions, especially Hispanic-serving institutions, and redirect it toward those exempt schools instead. 
The decision effectively pulls money away from California, which has a high concentration of Hispanic-serving institutions, and moves it to the exempt schools, which are generally located in swing states or states that voted for Trump in 2024. While California has many minority-serving institutions, and even one historically Black graduate school, none are recognized as historically Black colleges or official tribal colleges.
The first Mongolian student club
To be considered a historically Black college, the undergraduate institution must have been established prior to 1964 and have a track record of serving Black students, which is less applicable to a newer state like California. Becoming a registered tribal college is also difficult, even for schools that might otherwise meet the criteria.
As a result, most other minority-serving schools, including many schools with a high percentage of Black or Native American students, apply for a more general federal grant that only asks the institution to prove that it has less money per-student than the average school in the U.S. and that it serves a diverse population. 
Laney College easily qualifies. Its enrollment is almost equally divided among Latino, Asian, Black and white students. The school is struggling financially under the state’s new community college funding formula, potentially requiring it to merge with another local college in the coming years. Its hard-scrabble reputation was depicted in the 2020 Netflix documentary Last Chance U, which profiled Laney College football players and the issues they faced in addition to their sport — including hunger and caring for their kids. 
Laney College uses all of its minority-serving institution grant funding for the Asian Pacific American Student Success center. Colleges are typically only eligible for one of these grants, even when it may have numerous communities that need support. Though the center is focused on Asian students, anyone is technically welcome to the services it provides.
The center is what kept Narmandakh Suurinburneebaatar in school. After moving from Mongolia to Oakland in 2008, she spent years knowing just a few words of English. When she enrolled in an English-language learning course at Laney College in 2013, she wasn’t aware of the Asian student center. She was nervous at the time and struggled to talk with other students and teachers, she said. She dropped out before the end of the semester. She also enrolled in 2016 but dropped out again after the first semester.

In 2022, Laney College offered free classes in light of the decline in student enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suurinburneebaatar’s son had also started moving through the Oakland school system, and she wanted to communicate with his teachers. She re-enrolled again, but this time, a representative from the Asian student center came to her English class, offering interpretation services for Mongolian speakers. It changed her entire trajectory. 
The center offered support, she said repeatedly: support in school, in finding a job, and in taking care of her son. 
In the fall of 2023, soon after discovering the Asian student center, she founded a Mongolian students club with a goal of strengthening the community, including one event that brought over 100 Mongolians to campus. Now Mongolian students from other colleges come to Laney because of its support services, and Suurinburneebaatar works part time at the Asian student center, tutoring others.
Proven success
The Asian center has never been financially secure, even before the Trump administration’s support for minority-serving institutions began to wane. The federal grant is awarded on a five-year cycle and Laney College’s final year was scheduled to end this month.  
Though the college applied again for another five-year grant, and has received the grant for the past 15 years, successfully navigating three different grant cycles, it’s a competitive process and the money is never guaranteed. To receive the money repeatedly, schools need to prove their programs are successful. 
In 2019, Lee co-published a study that looked at how counseling for English-language learners affected their performance. The study found that students who received counseling support were more likely to “return and re-enroll” than those who didn’t, though the study also found that academic performance was roughly the same for both groups.

At Southwestern College, a community college and a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution near San Diego, students were invited to join what’s known as a “learning community,” where they had access to specialized counseling and content tailored for Latinos. An evaluation conducted by the school found that students who participated in the grant-funded learning community were far more likely to stay in school, to graduate and to transfer to a four-year institution, said President Mark Sanchez.  
Because minority-serving institutions have wide discretion as to how they use federal money, evaluating the efficacy of the entire program — including hundreds of institutions and thousands of programs — is tough, said Marcela Cuellar, a professor at UC Davis. Some programs are a mixed bag in terms of results. Nonetheless, Cuellar pointed to a few studies  that show the grants’ broad-reaching impact on increasing students’ retention, reducing their debt, and improving graduation rates. She said the new cuts are “heartbreaking.”
Officials at both the community college system and the University of California system agreed with Cuellar, saying the cuts were concerning or troubling, according to their respective spokespeople. A spokesperson for the Cal State University system said it was too early to comment on the decision. 
Using state funds, which currently represent about a quarter of the center’s annual budget, Espinoza said in her email to faculty that Laney College will replace Lee’s full-time position with a part-time faculty role next year. She also said the college will offer each student worker another campus job.
Lee has already offered Suurinburneebaatar a different campus job, but she said no. She’s taking five classes this semester in pursuit of a goal — to graduate this spring with an associate degree in business administration.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_Laney-College_MO_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

After winning a costly legislative fight last year against rival card rooms, California’s tribes got lawmakers to ban a type of online sweepstakes.


For the second straight year, casino-owning tribes persuaded lawmakers to pass legislation that directly attacks the tribes’ business competitors.
Earlier this month, the California Legislature approved Assembly Bill 831, which bans companies from offering certain types of online sweepstakes that the tribes see as a threat to their exclusive rights to gambling in California.
In an example of how much political clout the tribes have — thanks in part to the millions of dollars they have donated to legislators’ reelection campaigns — the measure easily passed both legislative chambers without any of California’s 120 lawmakers voting against it. 
In total, the groups for and against the bill have spent at least $1.7 million on lobbying the Legislature so far this year, according to filings with the California secretary of state.
Gov. Gavin Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign Anaheim Democratic Assemblymember Avelino Valencia’s bill. It follows a bill Newsom signed into law last year that allowed tribes to sue their rivals, privately owned gambling halls called card rooms, to try to stop them from offering table games such as blackjack. 
The tribes immediately sued card rooms after they won one of the most expensive political fights of the last two-year legislative session. The feuding gambling factions each spent millions on lobbying and on lawmakers’ campaigns. 
The tribes’ case against card rooms is pending.
How the sweepstakes games work
This year’s measure attacks companies offering a style of gaming that’s exclusively online — and already offered in California. 
Players typically download an app to play a game of chance such as slots or cards. 
Each day, they are given a limited number of free virtual gold coins to play. When the players run out of free coins, they can purchase more from the company to keep playing.
Even with a virtual coin purchase, there’s no cash payout for winning one of the games of chance.
But to lure in customers — and keep the ones they have playing — the companies also give out tokens called “sweepstakes coins” that can be used to participate in sweepstakes that are separate from the card or slot games. 
Sweepstakes coins are provided to players as a “bonus” with the purchase of gold coins, through promotions or as complimentary rewards. Those coins are potentially redeemable for real-world prizes or cash, unlike the game-play coins, according to the bill’s analysis. 
At least one of the gaming companies has offered a $1 million sweepstakes payout.
The companies argue that because the game-play coins have no cash value and sweepstake coins are not available for direct purchase, their business model isn’t gambling and their sweepstakes aren’t illegal lotteries since there’s no monetary risk for a player.
The virtual sweepstakes games are exploding in popularity. The so-called “sweepstakes casino” companies raised an estimated $3.1 billion in 2022, and was projected to surpass $8 billion by the end of last year, according to the bill analysis.

The tribes told lawmakers the business model is a dangerous form of unregulated gambling that needs to be banned in California. 
They argue the virtual companies offering the “dual-currency” games are cutting into the exclusive rights California voters in 1998 and 2000 gave tribes to offer gambling at their casinos, which have provided an economic lifeline to disenfranchised Native American communities. 
“Unregulated online sweepstakes threaten this voter-approved system by imitating casino gaming without oversight, accountability or community investment,” Isaiah Vivanco, chairman of the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians, told a Senate committee this summer. “These illegal platforms erase all benefits of regulated gaming while exposing consumers to serious risk.”Vivanco, whose tribe has a casino in San Jacinto in Riverside County, told lawmakers that allowing virtual sweepstakes casinos to continue to operate in California will “destabilize the entire legal gaming ecosystem,” causing economic harm to communities across the state. 
In total, the various casino-owning tribes that supported the measure to kill the sweepstakes casinos have given at least $7.6 million to California’s legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. 
Card rooms and small tribes oppose
By contrast, the companies that have formally opposed AB 831 haven’t given any money to California lawmakers, according to Digital Democracy. 
The online gaming companies argue that their games are safe to play.
“The industry on its own has adopted responsible gaming measures, play limits, has user verification, has age verification,” Bill Gantz, a lawyer representing the Social Gaming Leadership Alliance, told lawmakers this summer. 
Plus, the gaming companies ask: If their business model is illegal, as the tribes claim, why does the state need a law that explicitly makes it so?
“It doesn’t pass the smell test,” said Derek Brinkman, the executive product advisor at Virtual Gaming World, one of the companies fighting AB 831.
If Newsom signs the measure, it would create new criminal penalties for companies offering the disputed sweepstakes, as well as “any entity, financial institution, payment processor, geolocation provider, gaming content supplier, platform provider or media affiliate” that supports a sweepstakes casino, according to the bill analysis. Violators would face up to a year in jail and fines of up to $25,000.
The threat of new criminal penalties, potentially even for players, is why the American Civil Liberties Union opposed the measure.  
Card rooms and the association of cities reliant on the revenue they receive from the gambling halls also opposed it. The bill doesn’t specifically target card rooms, but the tribes’ rival gambling establishments, still smarting from last year’s legislative defeat, worried their competitors would find a way to use the pending law against them.A handful of small California tribes that don’t have large casinos also opposed the measure and hope Newsom vetoes it. He has until Oct. 12 to make a decision.
Since Newsom first ran for governor in 2017, the state’s tribes have contributed more than $7 million to him through his ballot measures, his anti-recall campaign and his various candidate committees.
Eric Wright of the Klestsel Dehe Wintun Nation headquartered in Williams in the Sacramento Valley said some small tribes like his hope to team up with virtual gaming companies to try to generate revenue for their impoverished isolated communities using the sweepstakes games.  
The income would be a pittance compared to what the tribes with “brick and mortar” casinos pull in, he said.
“This is about fairness,” Wright told CalMatters. “In California gaming, the framework has worked for some tribes because of geography. But whole tribes were left out. We didn’t even get a seat on that boat.”

(Photo: Nevada Strategic Growth Initiative)Nevada is the only state in the nation that can deliver on every phase of the lithium life cycle – from mining to recycling.
Industry experts in the state say that selling point has the potential to make Nevada a leader in the lithium battery supply chain that powers everything from electric vehicles to the data centers driving AI growth. 
Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo emphasized the importance of lithium for diversifying Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy at his second annual Nevada Lithium Summit Friday.
The lithium industry, however, has been hammered by falling prices in recent years due to softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally, which has made mining the metal in the U.S. less attractive to investors.
On the second day of the lithium summit, Politico reported the Department of Energy (DOE) was reevaluating a $2.3 billion loan to the Thacker Pass lithium project, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border. The energy agency cited the drop in price as a key factor in their rethink of the loan.
During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.”
Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices. Earlier this year, mining developer Ioneer Corp. lost a $490 million investment to their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County after their investing partner backed out of the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.
Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.
“Commodities ebb and flow,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during a press conference at the summit. 
Despite falling prices, Burns said Nevada’s position as the only state in the nation with a complete “Lithium Loop” that could offer mining and processing to battery manufacturing and recycling gave the state an edge for investment.
More investment from the federal government isn’t off the table, said Burns. President Donald Trump has made reducing foreign critical mineral dependency a major priority, citing national and economic security concerns. Nevada is poised to meet that need, said Burns.
“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” Burns said. “I think you’ll see that in Nevada.”
“Specifically, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy has an interest in making sure those are produced here,” Burns continued.
Nevada Battery Coalition CEO Caleb Cage said industry experts believe the growing demand for lithium and battery storage will increase and stabilize prices for the metal over the next decade.
“Looking at it long term, the remarkable demand for lithium in particular should have the market effect of adjusting that price to make some of these projects more viable,” Cage said. 
“The demand for battery storage is only growing right now,” Cage said. 
Growing battery storage demand has already boosted Nevada’s economy. A decade ago, about 100 people were employed in the battery manufacturing industry, according to GOED. In 2025, more than 14,200 were employed in the industry. 
Manufacturing grew by about 83% in Nevada from 2015 to 2025, significantly more than the 13% national average. That growth was largely driven by the battery manufacturing industry boosted by electric vehicles and clean energy demands. 
Several companies have invested in battery manufacturing and recycling facilities in Nevada, including Tesla and Redwood Materials.
Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.
Electricity demand in the U.S. has continued to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. Those data centers will need battery storage systems to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.
Growing adoption of renewable energy sources, sustainability objectives, and need for energy efficiency is also driving the transition away from traditional lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion batteries in data centers.
In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy to build low-cost energy-storage systems that can meet surging power demand from AI data centers. The company said it’s already powering a modular data center in Sparks, Nevada for AI infrastructure company Cursoe at an energy cost lower than the grid.
“They’ve got that proof of concept out in Northern Nevada right now, and that model is going to be something that they want to replicate,” Cage said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lithiumboom-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Courtesy of Ivory Innovations) Utah’s most expensive housing prices in Summit and Wasatch counties — home to high-end ski resorts and popular mountain towns of Park City, Heber and Kamas — are in the millions. 
In Park City, the median single family home sells for $3.95 million, and condos sell for $1.85 million, according to the Park City Board of Realtors’ latest data. In the larger market areas of Summit and Wasatch counties, the median price of a single-family home is $1.79 million, while condos go for $1.12 million. 
But on the western edge of Summit County, in the small city of Francis — about a 25 minute drive to Park City or Heber — a Utah home builder is trying to help provide more relatively affordable options for working-class people wanting to live in the mountains. And the company says it’s prioritizing selling and renting to “essential workers” including teachers, first-responders, and local small business employees. 
Utah governor doubles down on goal to build 35K homes in 5 years 

“Essential workers shouldn’t have to choose between an hour-plus commute and living in the community they serve,” said Clark Ivory, CEO of Utah’s largest home building company, Ivory Homes.
Ivory Innovations — the nonprofit arm of Ivory Homes and an academic center based at the University of Utah David Eccles School of Business that’s focused on solutions for affordable housing — held a ribbon cutting ceremony on Tuesday for the development, named Innovation Park at Francis Commons. 
Ivory called it the “first step to ensuring that the teachers educating our children, first responders protecting our families and health care workers caring for our community can afford to live where they work.”
“This development proves we can create high-quality affordable housing, even in Utah’s most expensive markets,” he said. 
The Francis Commons project includes 64 townhomes and 30 single-family homes for sale, though all 30 of the single-family homes have already sold. The townhomes are priced below $470,000, while the single-family homes were priced in the low $600,000 range.

Sixteen townhomes have also been set aside as rentals that are income-restricted for individuals making a salary of up to roughly $70,000 or families of three making up to about $90,000, Ivory said. 
Rent for a two-bedroom unit for someone making 60% of the area median income would be about $1,990 a month, according to the development’s website. For someone making 80% of the area median income, rent would be about $2,241. 
That may not seem affordable to many. But the average income of Utah’s median household is about $98,000, according to a report published in April by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. After adjusting for cost-of-living differences between states, the report said that puts Utah’s median household income highest in the country, and nearly 27% higher than the U.S. average of $77,719. 
And those prices are still hundreds of thousands of dollars lower than Summit County and Wasatch County’s median home prices. 
For the owner-occupied homes, Ivory said he’s only selling to people who are living there full time.
“If they’re buying a single-family home or a townhome, they need to commit to us that they’re going to be a primary resident. We’re not selling to investors. We’re not selling to those who want a second home up here in Summit County,” Ivory said. “We’re selling to those that are working here and making it happen in the community.”
The development was created through a partnership with Ivory Homes, the Call to Action Foundation and Francis city leaders as part of Ivory Homes’ larger Francis Commons subdivision master plan.

The partnership has committed to build 1,500 affordable homes across Utah — in support of Gov. Spencer Cox’s goal to build 35,000 starter homes in the state by 2028. The governor has set housing affordability as a top priority for his administration, as the state has faced skyrocketing housing prices, especially over the last five years, while also grappling with a housing shortage that experts have estimated at more than 37,000 units and counting. 
But there’s still a long way to go toward fulfilling Cox’s goal. 
So far 5,801 starter homes have been built — most of which (2,814) are concentrated in Utah County — according to the state’s housing dashboard. 
Cox, in a post on X earlier this month, acknowledged “we know there’s more to do.” He encouraged Utahns to “track our progress” toward the goal on that dashboard. 
Francis Mayor Jeremie Forman said affordable housing has been a “big challenge,” but he applauded the development with Ivory Homes as a “really big deal.”
“The ability to have full-time residents here in Francis that are able to afford to live here, to work here, raise their families here, that builds a sense of community that a second-home community does not build,” he said. “So we’re super excited to have this product here. Hopefully others will follow suit.”

But a 2000 omnibus pay bill that allowed local officials to increase compensation for local officials in the form of expense accounts and at least three Alabama attorney general’s opinions that say expense accounts are not compensation allow lawmakers to raise local officials’ renumeration before they complete a term.
Legislators during the most recent session filed nearly 25 bills that dealt with the compensation of county officials, according to a tabulation by the Alabama Reflector.

18 of the bills, almost 75%, were approved by the Legislature and eventually signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey.
While the bills filed in the 2025 session that focused on pay raises dealt with different offices, the majority of them, almost 80%, were meant to provide increases to either sheriffs or probate judges. Some examples:

HB 452, sponsored by Rep. Kerry Underwood, R-Tuscumbia, increases the expense account for the Colbert County sheriff so that the total compensation for the sheriff will rise from $50,000 per year to $96,000 per year effective Oct. 1, with the money converting to salary in January 2027.
HB 500, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, increases the Lawrence County sheriff’s expense account to ensure the sheriff receives compensation equal to a yearly equivalent of $95,000 from Oct. 1 through Jan. 19 of next year, at which point the money will convert to salary.
HB 431, sponsored by Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, created a $15,000 expense account for the Monroe County Sheriff through January 2027, when it will convert to salary.
SB 339, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, was an explicit salary increase for the Madison County sheriff, raising yearly pay from $154,000 to , $170,000 effective June 1, without a reference to expense accounts.

A message was left with the county commissions of the two counties and Givhan seeking comment.
Advocates for law enforcement said that the salary increases are necessary to attract the best candidates for the job.
“From my personal experience in Baldwin County, I had three, if not four, police chiefs who made more money than I did,” said Hoss Mack, executive director of the Alabama Sheriffs Association. “It is not just about the money; it is about attracting people to run for the office.”
Rep. Randy Wood, R-Anniston, who introduced legislation to increase the compensation of the Talladega County Sheriff that did not pass, said that sheriffs in other counties received pay increases already and that the legislation introduced in the spring was supposed to reduce the disparities in the salaries between other sheriffs who oversee departments with similar populations and a similar geographic area.
Wood said part of the reason for his bill, HB 434, was because sheriffs lost one avenue to raise revenue when the Legislature made it optional for people to purchase a pistol permit for carrying a firearm. Money from the sale of pistol permit fees partially funded the operations of sheriffs offices throughout the state, but were not typically used for salaries.
“That was a large sum of money that kept the sheriffs’ office going,” Wood said. “Talladega was one of the counties that lost it.”
How it works
Amendment 92 to the Alabama Constitution states that “neither the legislature, nor any county of the state shall, by the imposition of new, different, and additional duties or otherwise, increase, or authorize the increase of, the salary, fees or other compensation of any officer of the state or of any county of the state, who is elected or appointed for a fixed term, during the term for which he is elected or appointed.”
But an omnibus pay bill passed by the Legislature in 2000, which established baseline salaries for local officials, allows legislators to “increase the compensation for local officials” by local legislation.
Local elected officials are also “entitled to receive the same uniform increases in compensation, whether the uniform increases are based on a percentage of compensation or a flat dollar amount, that are granted equally to all county employees by the county commission.”
“The work around is to immediately grant an expense allowance and have that roll into the salary at the start of the next term,” said Othni Lathram, director of the Alabama Legislative Services Agency, in a statement.
Most of these increases pass through with little notice. Unlike general bills, local bills are rarely if ever publicly debated on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives or the Alabama Senate. While larger counties like Jefferson and Mobile have committees that hold public hearings on local legislation, most local bills move at the pleasure of the lawmakers who represent those areas.
‘Not compensation or renumeration’
The 2000 omnibus bill set minimum salaries and provided conditions for fixed pay increases while allowing legislators to increase pay for county officials through local law. It also allowed elected officials to receive merit raises given to other employees in the form of expense allowances.
“The omnibus act does not, and cannot, jump over the prohibition against receiving a ‘salary’ increase during your term. The prohibition is in the constitution and we can’t supersede the constitution with a statute,” said Sonny Brasfield, the executive director of the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA).  “This issue gets even more complicated when you start looking at the provisions of local laws that provide immediate expense allowances — not an increase in salary — during the term of office.  The attorney general has issued many opinions making a distinction between expense allowances and salary increases.”
Since at least 1980, the Alabama attorney general’s office has considered expenses separate from compensation. In an opinion that year, then-Attorney General Charles Graddick wrote that “the expenses of public officers in the performance of their official duties are distinct and not included in the compensation allowed them, and therefore the reimbursement of public officers for such expenses is not subject to constitutional prohibitions against the alteration of compensation during the term of office.”
In a 2002 opinion, then-Attorney General Bill Pryor wrote that elected officials were entitled to merit raises awarded under the 2000 omnibus act. Pryor wrote that with the constitutional prohibition, officials “must be paid the increase in the form of an expense allowance until the commencement of their next term of office when that portion of their expense allowance will be converted into salary.”
In a 2005 opinion on the compensation of supernumerary sheriffs, then-Attorney General Troy King cited Graddick’s 1980 opinion, and wrote that expense allowances were “not compensation or renumeration.”
“The constitution prohibits salary increases during the term of office; it does not prohibit expense allowances,” Brasfield said. “Many local laws provide for the elected officials to receive an immediate expense allowance that goes away at the start of the next term and is replaced by a salary increase. This is a long-standing practice and isn’t something new at all.”
Mack added that the sheriff’s office in each of the respective counties has additional responsibilities that police chiefs may not have.
“The sheriff runs the county jail,” Mack said. “They are the only officers of the court for law enforcement, so they are executing all of the paperwork that comes from the circuit and district court. The sheriff is also one of the three managers over all the elections: the sheriff, circuit clerk and the probate judge oversee all of the county, state and federal elections in every county in the state.”
‘What the county commission wants’
Legislators said the requests for compensation increases came from local officials, and not necessarily those getting the added money.
“I didn’t really look at it as playing games with the rules,” said Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, who sponsored legislation to give the Calhoun County sheriff a pay raise. “I think we set it up on information that we had at the time and were looking at a number of other things. We were looking at county expenses, income, and things like that, to retain a consistency there.”
Rep. Reed, Ingram, R-Pike Road, sponsored HB 424, which would have increased the Montgomery County Sheriff’s compensation by $50,000 prior to the completion of his term. Ingram said he goes “by what the county commission wants.”
“It was their resolution and that was the way they wanted it,” he said. “Showing bipartisan support, I felt like they had already vested it out. All we do is carry the bill.”
HB 424 was not enacted into law, a casualty of the time limit on the Legislature.
Mack said the practice was the only way to provide sheriffs with a pay raise without having to wait until the start of a new term.
“The timing is on a case by case issue. In some cases the sheriff may not have had a pay increase in years and may have worked with the local legislative delegation to start the process,” he said in a statement. “Sometimes it may take 1-3 years to get the legislation passed.  It may get held up in committee or not placed on the calendar for a vote due to other legislation being considered or a filibuster. This system is not perfect because you are dealing with 67 counties with various populations and very different budgets.”
Mack said that the increase in the expense account does not apply to retirement, and the sheriff will not get credit for the additional pay until the following term of office.
Brasfield said the law was “a recognition that individual salary increases should be decided on a county-by-county basis.”
“Because the responsibilities of the elected officials vary so much and because the financial condition of the county commissions are also very different, we felt these issues could be more effectively addressed with local legislation,” he said in a statement.
The ACCA supports the current process as the local bills to raise salaries were negotiated among the county commissioners, the body that funds the salary increases, and the legislators who introduced the bills.
“That process has served the taxpayers very well.” Brasfield said. “I think it has also served the elected officials very well. That legislation came from inside our organization as a way to try and eliminate what, at the time, was an almost constant fight in the Legislature over elected official salaries.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Statehouse-0747-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Trump administration officials, looking at the possible impact of large insurance premium increases for millions of next year’s Obamacare customers, want more people to consider plans with less generous benefits and high deductibles.
The agency that oversees the ACA announced early this month that it would expand eligibility for “catastrophic” plans sold in Affordable Care Act online marketplaces. The plans require people to spend more than $10,000 a year on deductibles before the policies pay most medical costs but carry lower monthly premiums than other Obamacare policies.
The move reflects growing concern among Republicans about political backlash if Congress doesn’t extend larger tax credits put in place during the covid-19 public health emergency to help consumers pay their premiums. The extra subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year, resulting in an average 75% increase in the amount people pay for coverage, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
A small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced legislation to extend the enhanced covid-era subsidies for one more year, which would keep them in place through midterm congressional elections in fall 2026.
But the fate of that legislation is uncertain, with many Republicans opposed to extending the extra tax credits, with a permanent change costing at least $335 billion over 10 years. Without an extension, tax credit amounts would revert to pre-pandemic levels.
“They spent the last 15 years against the ACA, so a lot will be steadfast, but others are worried about the effect of massively spiked premiums on their constituents,” noted a Democratic Senate staffer who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.
Republicans currently control Congress by slim margins, raising the stakes if voters who lose their ACA tax credits blame them at the ballot box.
Catastrophic plans are a little-known type of Obamacare policy that have previously been limited mainly to people under age 30. While they come with lower monthly premiums than other types of ACA plans, the coverage has higher annual deductibles, which are set at the out-of-pocket maximum for the year: $10,600 for individuals in 2026 or $21,200 for families.
A deductible is the amount patients must spend on health care before insurance plans pay for most services. Catastrophic plans do cover three primary care visits a year without having to pay the full deductible and, as with other ACA policies, policyholders pay nothing for preventive services such as some cancer screenings and vaccines.
The catastrophic plans will automatically show up on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, for consumers who lose tax credit coverage entirely next year due to their household income. Another category of consumers — people who continue to qualify for tax credits but not for subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs — may also be eligible but would have to send in paperwork.
“By expanding access to catastrophic plans, we are making sure hardworking people who face unexpected hardships can get affordable coverage that protects them from devastating medical costs,” Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement.
It isn’t clear whether the policy changes will make the plans more attractive to consumers. Catastrophic plans aren’t available in all states, and the size of the deductibles can be off-putting.
“It’s a ton of money,” said Louise Norris, a health insurance analyst and broker who writes regularly about the ACA. “A full-price catastrophic plan is still more expensive than some people can afford, but they’re doing this to offer a slightly more affordable option.”
Catastrophic plans have had limited appeal, with only about 54,000 out of Obamacare’s 24 million enrollees currently opting for the coverage, according to government data, Norris said.
“Uptake has always been quite low,” said Katie Keith, director of the O’Neill Institute’s Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. “It’s not a bad option if it is the only option you have. I question whether consumers are looking for this kind of coverage.”
CMS plans to grant people a “hardship” designation to enroll in catastrophic plans if they lose eligibility for ACA tax credits next year. Most likely to qualify are people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate ($62,600 for an individual this year, or $106,600 for a family of three), who will lose access to all premium subsidies if Congress does not extend the current enhanced tax credits. It’s also unclear how much premiums will cost. Insurers, reacting to the new administration guidance, might seek to recalculate their rates based on what they estimate may be an influx of older people into the plans, Norris said.
AHIP, the insurance industry lobbying group, is pushing hard for the larger tax credits to be extended. It did not comment specifically on how the new guidance might affect catastrophic health plan premiums. Still, AHIP spokesperson Chris Bond said that “while catastrophic plans can provide important coverage for specific needs, they are not a replacement for affordable comprehensive coverage.”
There are other hurdles. Norris said insurers don’t offer plans at all in 10 states: Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming. And where they are available, options are few. This year, for example, a 25-year-old in Orlando, Florida, had a choice of 61 “bronze” plans, the cheapest level of coverage available to all ACA shoppers, but just three catastrophic plans.
Policy experts say the expanded eligibility for catastrophic plans makes it more important than ever for consumers to consider all options when shopping for ACA coverage during the annual open enrollment period, which starts Nov. 1. In addition to the catastrophic and bronze plans, there are also “silver” and “gold” plans, each with varying premiums and deductibles.
Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but the highest deductibles; the average bronze deductible this year is $7,186, which is still lower than the catastrophic plans, according to KFF.
Catastrophic plan deductibles, while high, are comparable to some bronze plans, Norris noted. People who choose catastrophic plans are not eligible for any ACA tax subsidies to help pay monthly premiums.
A pending court battle may provide lawmakers concerned about voter pushback on Obamacare changes an unintended reprieve.
In late August, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily put on hold some changes the Trump administration had ordered for next year. Those changes, included in a June regulatory filing by the administration, would have added additional verification paperwork requirements for some people enrolling in ACA plans, and were challenged by several cities, which cited government estimates that the changes could cause up to 1.8 million people to lose their insurance in 2026.
The court ruling stayed several provisions of the Trump administration rules, including income verification requirements that would affect people below the poverty level and those without tax return information. The move also paused verification requirements affecting people who apply outside the annual open enrollment period and blocked a $5 monthly charge for people who are automatically enrolled into plans in which subsidies cover the entire premium — unless they contact the marketplace and confirm their selection.
The Trump administration is appealing the decision, but the case may not be settled until next year, said Keith at Georgetown University.
That makes it likely that the pause of the new requirements will stay in place for this year’s open enrollment season.
Keith said the ruling was a “bigger deal” than expanding eligibility for catastrophic plans. “Consumers all across the country won’t have to deal with red tape the Trump administration rushed to put into place ahead of the new plan year,” and the ruling also “helps people keep their coverage.”

(Photo courtesy of USC)COLUMBIA — The University of South Carolina is seeking a partner to help run its new $30 million brain health clinic scheduled to open in March in downtown Columbia.
The center will house the most powerful MRI scanner in the state and be staffed by neurologists and radiologists with the necessary training to diagnose the most complicated cases of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia, said Julius Fridriksson, USC’s vice president for research.
The state’s largest university system is looking for a management company to staff and run the clinic on a day-to-day basis.
The center is located in a renovated 75,000-square-foot building the school owns on the Prisma Health Richland Hospital campus. It will be the main hub in a network of seven clinics already set up across the state in an effort to increase access to brain-related disease research and cutting-edge treatments, even in rural areas.
Since opening its first clinic in partnership with Prisma Health more than a year ago in Winnsboro, the USC Brain Health Network has seen more than 1,000 patients, and the number of visits keeps increasing, Fridriksson said.
What USC’s planned $350M neurological hospital could mean for SC

While awaiting the new center’s completion, USC medical school doctors have been booking appointments more than four days a week in university-leased space within the neurology department of Prisma’s Richland Hospital.
“So the Brain Health Center can’t come online fast enough,” Fridriksson said.
Also at the center, those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s will have the option to undergo treatment with recently approved drugs meant to slow the disease’s progression.
While Alzheimer’s makes up less than half of all dementia cases in South Carolina, those that are diagnosed early with the disease could greatly benefit from the state-of-the-art drugs, which received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval just last year.
“The drugs are good,” Fridriksson said. “I mean, if it was me or a family member that was starting to show signs of cognitive decline and the workup revealed that it is most likely Alzheimer’s disease, I’d do it in a heartbeat.”
The center will have six infusion rooms where patients can get their monthly treatment. The Medical University of South Carolina health system and Prisma offer these injectable drug treatments but on a smaller scale, Fridriksson said.
USC building $30M brain health center for Alzheimer’s, dementia treatment

“I think it’s the first time in my time as a researcher that we’ve had any significant improvement in managing Alzheimer’s disease,” he added. “And I hope that as many people can get those drugs as possible.”
But the drug does not come without risks, including a chance of stroke.
Part of administering it is having a powerful enough MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanner and a team of specially trained physicians to be sure the patient has Alzheimer’s rather than a different form of dementia that wouldn’t benefit from the treatment.
At the center, that will include a 7-tesla MRI scanner with a magnet strong enough to generate images of the brain with minute detail, as well as a 3-tesla scanner.
Tesla is a scientific term for the strength of a magnet. By comparison, most hospital MRI machines are just 1.5-tesla.
USC has collected bids from companies interested in joining in the center’s operations and receiving a share of the revenues. According to the public procurement schedule, the winning bid will be posted online Dec. 16.
If a suitable partner isn’t found, the school will consider running the center itself, Fridriksson said.
After all, it’s a sector of health care that does not generate a profit.
SC hospitals to give dementia patients more extensive care with federal program

“The Brain Health Network wouldn’t be needed if there was a lot of money to be made,” Fridriksson said. “There’s a reason why the big players are not rushing into this space.”
The network — with locations in Sumter, Seneca, Orangeburg, Lexington and Darlington, in addition to Winnsboro and Columbia — is run using $5 million in taxpayer dollars annually. So, while a potential partner isn’t likely to earn much, it won’t risk losing money.
The real benefit, according to Fridriksson, is the prestige of partnering with a major state research university. He said the relationship and the potential for participating in college-run research and clinical trials could be a recruiting tool for health care providers trying to hire the best doctors.
“So, for a hospital, if you want to attract physicians and nurses who want to be involved in cutting-edge stuff, partner with us,” Fridriksson said. “Even though these new drugs are coming online, there’s a lot more work to be done.”

The brain health clinic is located a half mile from the site of USC’s new $300 million School of Medicine campus, set for completion in 2027, and a $350 million neurological hospital and rehabilitation center planned for downtown Columbia’s BullStreet District. The Legislature provided $150 million this year toward the specialized hospital for neurological diseases.
The broader plans are another selling point for doctors and researchers considering a career in South Carolina.
Fridriksson imagines technological advances within the next decade that could help quadriplegics control their limbs and walk using brain implants and exoskeleton. Those suffering from locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that causes paralysis of all muscles except for those that control eye movements, could be able to speak through a computerized voice machine controlled by implants.
“We know that treatment is advancing with artificial intelligence and neuroscience,” Fridriksson said. “Rehab is going to be very different five years from now. And having the hospital be in the thick of that, the timing could not be better.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/braincenter-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)To Christopher Roberts, president, Auburn University:
Last week, you announced that you fired Auburn employees over “insensitive” social media posts. But you left a lot of unanswered questions, such as:
1. How many employees were actually fired?
2. What was the point of not disclosing the number of employees you had sacked? Was there some personnel issue here? Not doing so would suggest an attempt to intimidate Auburn workers.
3. What exactly was posted that led to these firings? Were these done by people speaking in their positions as Auburn employees, or as private citizens expressing their opinions?
4. You wrote that “actions that endorse, glorify or trivialize violence . . . have no place at Auburn.” Agreed. So if these posts did so, why not quote them or show the kind of speech you see as condoning violence, to ensure people are clear on what condoning violence is? Keeping them in the dark would appear to create uncertainty and compel silence from the people who work for you.
5. You made this announcement after U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville spent Wednesday morning away from the nation’s business to make Facebook posts complaining about public comments in the wake of far-right activist Charlie Kirk’s killing. Did Sen. Tuberville influence your decision? He sure seemed happy with your announcement.
6. Speaking of which, you said the posts were at odds with “Auburn’s values of respect, integrity and responsibility.” So I have to ask: Considering your belief in those values, will Sen. Tuberville be barred from speaking on campus?
7. Do I have to remind you why? Just in case:

        a. In 2022, Tuberville said at a Nevada political rally that descendants of enslaved people “do the crime.”
b. In 2023, Tuberville took months to condemn white nationalism, often retreating to claims of victimhood when challenged.
c. In 2024, he said most immigrants “are garbage.”
d. Last June, he referred to people who live in urban areas as “inner-city rats.”
e. In the same interview, he said Muslim-American immigrants in Alabama would “overwhelm us” and that “we have to fight back.”
f. And if none of this seems like a problem to you, you might note that Tuberville last year said U.S. Sen. Katie Britt — a former Business Council of Alabama CEO and the soon-to-be senior senator from Alabama — delivered the response to then-President Joe Biden’s State of the Union because she was “picked as a housewife.”

8. You’re aware that this is just a sampling of some of the despicable things Tuberville, now running for Alabama governor, has said?
9. So would you allow someone to speak on campus who has repeatedly shown zero respect to nonwhite Alabamians and little responsibility in what he says? Or is there a different set of standards for people like Tuberville?
10. Do you remember when white nationalist Richard Spencer spoke at Auburn in 2017? Boy, was that a mess. Auburn somehow let Spencer rent a hall, then tried to cancel his appearance. Not because Spencer believes in the creation of a white ethnostate; advocates ethnic cleansing and spreads false, hateful rhetoric that white people are more intelligent than other races, but because of “public safety.” Spencer got an injunction against the university and spoke regardless.
11. So, just curious: Considering your concerns about “respect, integrity and responsibility,” can you make a guarantee to the Auburn student body, particularly the women and minorities in it, that Auburn will oppose any speaker on campus who would call for anyone’s forced exclusion from public life because of some innate characteristic? Or who calls for their forced expulsion from the country of their birth? Or will you stand by and shrug about “free speech” as your students and colleagues get threatened?
12. Oh, speaking of which: When posting that letter about firing employees, did you take the time to email Auburn’s workforce? I mean, if you’re going to make a major decision about the employment status of their colleagues and the university’s policies about what can and can’t be said, you should have the courtesy to first inform the people most affected by it, right?
13. Or was this whole thing — the vagueness, the menace, the veiled threats — done for Tuberville?
I fear that I already know the answers to these questions. After all, you and your colleagues at the University of Alabama folded faster than a raincoat when state officials began menacing Black and LGBTQ+ students on your campuses. Whenever there’s been a clash between a better future for our state and bowing to the petty hatreds of the political present, our universities’ administrators have shown a distressing tendency to go for the latter.
But if Auburn is going to start obsessively monitoring employees’ comments on public events, you should at least let your workers know what is and isn’t free speech. And who gets to speak freely at Auburn, and who doesn’t.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Auburn-University-04-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-22 08:57:01.829038

(Courtesy New Mexico Historic Sites)Just after a Civil War infantry re-enactment during Fort Stanton’s annual celebration, as Mescalero Apache dancers suited up for a warrior dance, the fort’s manager Oliver Horn stepped onto the stoop of the site’s old guardhouse in order to address a few dozen people gathered there — some of them costumed like Union soldiers.
“There was a real chance that we would have lost this amazing location of such rich New Mexico heritage and culture and history if it wasn’t for them,” Horn said, gesturing to a group of firefighters from different agencies lined up on either side of him. “We would not be here.”
Horn’s words on Aug. 23 referenced the Camp Fire, which had burned during Memorial Day weekend a few months prior and threatened to destroy the historic site. 
First established in southeastern New Mexico in 1855 as a base to ward off Mescalero Apache raids, Fort Stanton since that time has hosted an array of historical figures like Billy The Kid and Kit Carson. Buffalo Soldiers posted there; tuberculosis patients received treatment in its halls; and the United States interned German sailors there during World War II.
This year’s annual celebration acknowledged much of that history, but Horn also took a moment to honor more than a dozen firefighters from local, state and federal agencies who represented the 150 or so who responded to the blaze. He presented them with plaques commemorating their “exemplary actions in protecting and preserving the culture and history in New Mexico,” in an effort he said amounts to the largest firefighting operation to save a cultural resource in New Mexico history.
After honoring the firefighters, Horn walked from the guardhouse across the fort’s courtyard, where the Buffalo Soldiers regimental band once practiced, and entered its chapel, first built in 1913.

There, amid the periodic booms of cannon blasts from the other side of the courtyard, he presented to a handful of attendees his approach to keeping the fort resilient to wildfire despite being in one of the most “fire-prone areas in New Mexico.” 
While the firefighters’ work on the Camp Fire was crucial, the fort still stands today, Horn contends, due to a multi-agency effort over the past few years to protect it from wildfire and counteract mistakes made over the last couple centuries. It’s an effort he thinks serves as a model for others trying to protect cultural resources amid increasing wildfire risk, and has improved safety ratings, he said, for the area’s volunteer fire department, which keeps homeowner’s insurance affordable in a county where prices are skyrocketing elsewhere. 
“Essentially our water system, our infrastructure, helps protect nearly a billion dollars in private property in this county,” he said. “What I’m hopeful for is that if we can execute this project, it will be a model for other communities across New Mexico to establish defensible space for themselves.”
While the project Horn embarked on is making significant progress, he said, much is left to be done, including restoring an acequia irrigation system surrounding the courtyard and removing a stand of dead and dying Siberian elms: “noxious weeds” that can catapult any wildfire into the historic buildings Horn is trying desperately to preserve. 
So Horn said he panicked when he got the call about the wildfire barreling toward Fort Stanton. His mind flashed to the elms. He thought to himself, “I just need a few more years.”
Holding the fort
It was about 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 24 when a nearby landowner spotted smoke at the Fort and called 911. Jake Canavan, chief of the volunteer Lincoln Fire Department, showed up a few minutes later, followed by Lincoln County Manager Arron Griewahn, who took over command of the situation.
According to public records, firefighter accounts and Horn’s eyewitness testimony, Griewahn and Canavan then paged firefighters across the county, reporting that a northeasterly wind pointed the blaze directly at the fort. About 50 local volunteers arrived quickly, and the State Forestry division, which is building its own teams of professional fire crews, dispatched two engines from its headquarters in nearby Capitan.
Federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, heard about the fire over the radio and dispatched teams from the nearby ranger office in Ruidoso. One of those teams was a helitack Hotshot crew from Mississippi that was deployed to high-fire-risk areas.
About 150 firefighters ultimately mobilized to fight the blaze, which quickly spread more than a mile toward the fort, crawling along the Rio Bonito valley lined with dry grass, junipers and piñons.

Within hours, the blaze descended one side of a valley, rushed toward the Rio Bonito and destroyed three historic buildings, including a gymnasium used by interned German soldiers and two wooden structures the Civilian Conservation Corps built in the 1930s. 
If the fire had kept going up the other side of the valley, it would have fed on an outcropping of dead or dying Siberian elms that were first introduced during the Dust Bowl, launching it further toward the fort. 
Just beyond the elms sat the rest of Fort Stanton’s historic buildings, many of them with wood shake roofs. Canavan said a single ember on one of those old roofs could have destroyed the entire fort. 
“It would have caught some of those wood shake shingles on fire,” he said. “Once one of those buildings goes, it’s gonna be a bad day.”
But no ember made it past firefighters, Canavan said. They stood on the edge of the ridge with the blaze below them and the fort behind them. They had quick access to all the water they needed, thanks to the hydrants, and the helicopter pilot from Mississippi had access to a nearby dip site Canavan previously staged there. 
Even with the blaze only 4% contained on May 26, incident commanders reported that fire lines had held, sparing the fort any further damage. By May 29, the blaze was 87% contained and largely out.
The fire burned about 875 acres. Its cause is still being investigated. 
A fire ‘170 years in the making’
Once the fire was out, Horn — who was born and raised in Albuquerque but drawn to Fort Stanton after getting  a Ph.D in history from Notre Dame — wrote an essay laying out what he saw as the long threads of history that culminated with the Memorial Day weekend conflagration, a fire he sees as “170 years in the making.”
Horn maintains that the buildup of fuels in the area has largely been uninterrupted since Carson’s troops forced the Mescaleros to Bosque Redondo in 1862. The thinning and other work in the area is vital, he says, to restore the landscape to the way it looked for thousands of years, when the Mescaleros regularly used fire on the landscape.

A photograph, circa 1870, shows a band of Mescalero Apaches outside the newly built fort. Open grassland surrounds it. Horn attributes that emptiness to the longstanding Mescalero practice of setting fire to the grassland, which burned dead plant material, provided nutrients and prevented large-scale fires. 
The Mescaleros were enduring “hellish” conditions at Bosque Redondo between 1862 and 1865, according to Horn, and never returned to the grasslands after they left the forced reservation. Instead, the Mescaleros moved into the safety of the mountains nearby, what is now the town of Mescalero. 
In doing so, they surrendered the grassland below to ranchers, who introduced tens of thousands of cattle to the landscape. 
“And so what the cattle did is they started feeding the grass, and they tore up the grass, which created space for those saplings to take root and expand. And these forests, whether piñon-junipers down here in the lowlands, or the Douglas fir forests up in the mountains, started to increase in density,” Horn said during his presentation. 
Enter the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, which prompted the United States Agriculture Department to introduce the drought- and cold-resistant Siberian elm, which has since reproduced around the fort.
Today, a photographer capturing an image from the same vantage point as the photographer did back in 1870 would see a landscape cluttered with piñons and junipers, along with a build-up of Siberian elms around the fort’s perimeter, all desiccated by drought or riddled with disease and, as a result, rendered highly combustible.
“The USDA had the best of intentions at the time in terms of planning these Siberian elms,” Horn said. “Today, communities across New Mexico are trying to figure out ways to get rid of these trees. They are highly, highly invasive.”
 ‘It felt good to win’
The state’s Department of Cultural Affairs has invested about $8 million in capital projects recently, including $3.5 million on upgrading the water system. Improvements include replacing the visitor center’s old wood shake roof with synthetic material and installing 17 fire hydrants; and they have a plan and a $300,000 federal grant to replace invasive Siberian elms with native oaks. 
The Bureau of Land Management has also conducted multiple thinning and prescribed burns in the area in recent years, including in the area where the Camp Fire burned between May 25 and 30. According to a Source New Mexico review, the BLM has done more than 140 fuel treatments in the area since 1995; more than a third of those were in the last five years. 
Subsequently, Fort Stanton’s survival stands in stark contrast to other recent Lincoln County disasters. The McBride Fire in 2022, along with the South Fork and Salt Fire last summer, continue to wreak havoc on the Ruidoso area about 20 miles south of the fort, where deadly post-fire flooding occurs each monsoon season and homeowners insurance rates are growing increasingly unaffordable.

Canavan told Source that, as a result of fire hydrants and recent investments, a half-dozen homeowners approached him this summer and told him that they’d actually gotten rebates from their insurance companies, “which is unheard of,” he said. 
In addition to the recent investments, Canavan cited the quick mobilization of firefighters as the reason they were able to save the fort. 
And he and Griewahn also noted the thinning in the area, which helped them hold the fire “in check” and “get around it,” Griewahn said, pointing across the Rio Bonito, at a sparse array of slightly charred junipers and a landscape that bears the closest resemblance in the area to Horn’s old pictures of the pre-fort desert.
Griewahn, who has been in the thick of those natural disasters, told Source that the fort’s survival is worth celebrating. 
“I don’t want to use the wrong term, so to speak. But it felt good to ‘win,’” Griewahn said as he looked out over the Camp Fire burn scar, which stopped a few hundred feet from where he stood. “For us to get a fire stopped, and for us to meet our objectives and save all these buildings, it felt good to finally win.”
After looking at the burn scar, Griewahn and Canavan returned to the fort’s courtyard, taking shade under an antique fire truck next to a group of Civil War re-enactors, who were taking down their tent at the end of a long and festive day.
They watched children playing tag across the historic courtyard, running under an American flag lightly flapping in a mild breeze.

Health department officials last week added Maryland to a coalition of Northeastern states setting their own policies on vaccines, in the face of vaccine skepticism from the Trump administration. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Public health advocates are hoping Maryland’s participation in the newly formed Northeast Public Health Collaborative will help bring clarity to ongoing “confusion” around vaccine recommendations under the Trump administration — but how well that  group messaging works is yet to be seen.
“Time will tell – I hope it clarifies,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition. “I hope that a group of experts advises this coalition of states so that what they put out is trustworthy. Vaccines are critical for public health and we think it’s absolutely critical that everybody be able to get a vaccine if they want it.”
Maryland has joined a newly formed coalition of states trying to counter the Trump administration’s effort to restrict certain vaccine use — challenging longstanding public health wisdom that vaccinations are safe and effective.
The Maryland Department of Health announced its participation in the cohort of states last week. Other states involved in the collaborative include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. New York City is also a major player.
The state health department also released a set of vaccine recommendations for various respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

“These actions follow recent federal changes made to increase confusion and undermine proven public health protective measures,” the department said in a written statement Friday.
In recent months, federal health agencies operating under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have limited recommendations on who should receive certain vaccinations – going against the guidance of many medical societies.
Public health advocates say the administration has contributed to a climate of confusion around vaccinations, and report that patients are not sure who to trust.
The Northeast Public Health Collaborative hopes to counter that confusion by developing vaccine recommendations and other public health guidelines. But it’s not clear yet if the collaborative’s messaging will cut through the noise or add to it.
Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, thinks Maryland’s participation in the group is an imperfect step in the right direction.
“We think it’s a good idea,” he said. “Vaccines should be based on science. Is it a perfect solution? No, but it’s a step in the right direction.”
Matthew Celentano, executive director of the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland said it’s “too early to tell” if the collaborative’s effort will be effective in countering the Trump administration’s messaging.  But he agrees the effort is worth pursuing.
“They (the collaborative) want to replicate the public health work that’s been done for generations in the United States — and not bend to the will of political posturing that seems to be happening in the public health world right now,” he said. “If that leads to improved Marylanders’ health — that’s worth engaging in.”
In addition to joining the collaborative, the Maryland Department of Health has also released 2025-26 guidance for the flu, RSV and COVID-19.
Those recommendations largely reflect guidance from major medical societies such as the  American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
CDC panel opts against requiring prescription for COVID shot, wants greater emphasis on risks

Maryland’s COVID-19 recommendations also reflect guidance issued by the Northeast Public Health Collaborative last week as well. The group has not released guidance on RSV or the flu.
Essentially, Maryland’s recommendations suggest that most everyone get vaccinated for COVID-19 and the flu. The COVID-19 vaccine recommendation is “especially important” for those 65 years old or older and those who are at increased risk of severe infection.
Meanwhile, the RSV vaccine is recommended for those aged 75 and older or those aged 50 and older who are at an increased risk of severe disease.
Before the state joined the collaborative, Gov. Wes Moore (D) assured Marylanders that access to vaccinations would be protected in the state for the time being. In May, he signed legislation that required insurers to cover vaccinations that had been recommended by federal health officials as of December 2024, avoiding any change to coverage based on recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). That law took effect June 1.
“The Maryland Department of Health is focused on using evidence-based science to make decisions that best serve the people of our state,” state Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said in a written statement. “Research continues to show that vaccines are an effective way to keep our communities healthy. We encourage everyone to talk with a health care provider who can help assess your personal health care needs and determine if a vaccine is right for you.”

It's unclear what Democrat Mikie Sherrill would do. (Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)As Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill vie to become New Jersey’s next governor, Ciattarelli has used countless public appearances to tout how he’ll shift state policy on immigration, while Sherrill has been largely quiet about her own plans.
Ciattarelli has said if he is elected governor in November, he’ll move on “day one” to rescind the state order that provides sanctuary to undocumented immigrants, the Immigrant Trust Directive. The order from the state attorney general, which dates to 2018, restricts when state and local law enforcement can assist federal immigrant agents and from asking someone’s citizenship status if it’s not related to an investigation.
“Executive order No. 1 is ‘no sanctuary cities,’ and we will not be a sanctuary state,” he said at an event in Elizabeth on Thursday.
Sherrill, a congresswoman since 2019, has previously praised the directive without explicitly saying whether she’d seek to continue it if she’s elected. Asked during a Sunday gubernatorial debate whether the directive would remain in place if she is elected governor, she declined to answer.
“What I’m going to do is make sure we’re following the law and the Constitution, so that’ll include due process rights and the Constitution,” she said.
New Jersey has become a key battleground in the nation’s political war over immigration. The Trump administration worked with private prison firm Geo Group to open a migrant jail in Newark, Delaney Hall, earlier this year, the first immigrant detention center to open in President Trump’s second term and the largest one on the East Coast. The Trump administration is also eyeing Fort Dix as a potential home for migrant detainees.
The Trump administration has sued four New Jersey cities and their mayors over their local sanctuary policies, while acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is reportedly investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin, both Democrats, over the Immigrant Trust Directive. Murphy is leaving office in January after two terms.
A Quinnipiac University poll from last week said immigration is a top issue for likely Republican voters, second only to taxes, while the issue ranked less important for Democrats. In a November 2024 poll of New Jersey voters, the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University found that independents and especially Republicans named immigration as their second most important issue, while for Democrats, many other issues ranked higher.
Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton-Rutgers poll, said it’s not a surprise Sherrill has highlighted other topics on the campaign trail, like affordability and rising utility bills.
“These candidates are defining who they are, who they are not, and talking about those affordability issues in a way they think will best resonate that will best resonate with voters,” she said. “I don’t think we’ve seen a lot on immigration, and time will tell if we see this issue come to light and get a spotlight.”
Nearly 1 in 4 New Jerseyans are immigrants, and the state is home to more than 400,000 undocumented immigrants.
Sherrill’s public comments on the Immigrant Trust Directive have shifted in recent months.
During the campaign preceding June’s primary, when Sherrill faced five other Democrats also seeking the state’s top spot, she called the Immigrant Trust Directive “a plan that’s working.” Earlier this year, she characterized the directive  Politico New Jersey as “important protections.”
Her support of the directive was muddier when she spoke at a New Jersey Policemen’s Benevolent Association event, where an officer asked what she’d do about illegal immigration and whether she’d allow New Jersey cops to assist federal immigration officers. She responded as she did at Sunday’s debate — saying, “I’m going to follow the law and the Constitution” — comments that were met with some groans from the officers in attendance.
“I am a federal prosecutor. I’m the only one in this race who’s actually deported people for breaking the law,” she responded. “And I get that, that’s what I do. That’s what many of us want to see.”
She added: “We don’t want lawbreakers here. But at the same time, we also need our officers to follow the law, and that’s what I’ll require. Following the law and the Constitution.”
Her comments have frustrated immigrant advocates like Amy Torres, the executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. Torres said after eight years of Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, championing rights for immigrants, she’s concerned the state is “certainly not going to see more protections for immigrants” under either Ciattarelli or Sherrill.
“It’s not that there aren’t people who understand and realize the importance of this issue. It’s just that, unfortunately, of the two people that are running for governor, one understands it’s an issue, the other seems to think it doesn’t exist at all,” she said.
Torres noted that even though Ciattarelli lands on a different side of the fight than she does, she knows where he stands, unlike with Sherrill.
Torres criticized the comments the congresswoman made at the PBA event and said she wants to see Sherrill forcefully stand up for immigrants.
“I don’t want to hear the words ‘diversity’ or ‘belonging’ or ‘community.’ I want to hear, ‘This is a state of immigrants and we will defend them, which we’ve been doing for the last eight years,’” Torres said. “It’s impossible to tell where she is.”
Sherrill’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-22 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"New CT laws taking effect Oct. 1: E-bikes, towing, Sunday hunting",Gabby DeBenedictis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/22/new-ct-laws-oct-1-2025/,Over seven dozen Connecticut laws concerning a range of issues will wholly or partially take effect. Here's a look at some of them.,"Over seven dozen Connecticut laws concerning a range of issues, from regulations around e-bikes and helmets to hunting on Sundays, will wholly or partially take effect on Oct. 1. 
Connecticut laws are passed by the General Assembly during the legislative session each year — this year’s ran from Jan. 8 to June 4 — or in a special session. They typically take effect on Jan. 1, July 1 or Oct. 1.
Here’s a look at some of the laws that will be implemented next month.
Towing laws overhaul
An overhaul of Connecticut’s century-old towing statutes takes several steps to make it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow.
State law allows tow companies to begin the process of selling a towed vehicle with a value of $1,500 or less after 15 days, among the shortest windows in the country. The new law still allows towing companies to start the sales process after 15 days, but they will now have to take more steps to give the owner a chance to claim the vehicle and the actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
It also requires towing companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles immediately just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic or fire hydrants or are parked in a handicapped accessible spot.
The bill was passed following an investigation by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that showed how state towing laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of vehicle owners. 
A Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles working group is poised to examine portions of the state’s towing law that range far beyond its original mandate, potentially leading to more extensive reforms.
Sunday hunting
As of Oct. 1, Connecticut will permit hunting on Sundays — with some limitations.
The new law allows Sunday hunting, but limits it to private property and prohibits any hunting within 40 yards of a blue-blazed or federally designated hiking trail. The bill also prohibits the hunting of migratory birds on Sundays.
Hunters fought unsuccessfully for decades to overturn the state’s ban on Sunday hunting, which they have described as the last of Connecticut’s historic “blue laws.” In 2015, lawmakers partially repealed the ban for bow hunters.
Helmets
A new law raises the age under which motorcycle drivers and passengers are required to wear a helmet from 18 to 21, with a minimum $90 fine for infractions.
That law also requires that children under age 18 wear a helmet while riding vehicles like bicycles, scooters and skateboards. Previously, only children under age 16 were required to wear a helmet.
E-bikes
Another new law classifies some e-bikes, which previously lacked regulation around licensing and registration, as motor-driven cycles or motor-driven vehicles.
The law classifies e-bikes without pedals and with batteries over 750 watts as motor-driven cycles, which require a driver’s license to operate but are not required to be registered with the state.
E-bikes with batteries over 3,500 watts will be classified as motor-driven vehicles. It’s essentially the same classification as motorcycles and requires that vehicles be registered and insured.
Additionally, since e-bikes can be easily modified to reach speeds upwards of 60 miles per hour, the new law generally requires people who change an e-bike’s speed capability to label the vehicle with the appropriate modification.
Handcuffs on children
Police officers will now largely be prohibited from putting handcuffs on children under age 14, except in cases where handcuffing is necessary for public safety or the child is using or threatening physical force against an officer.
Existing law states that restraints like handcuffs be removed from a child before and during a court appearance. That law was unchanged.
First-cousin marriages
Connecticut law will now prohibit first cousins from knowingly marrying each other. Children born to first cousins are at an increased risk of genetic disorders and birth defects.
Existing Connecticut law, which remains in place, prohibits a person from marrying their parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent’s sibling, stepparent or stepchild.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_064-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Photo by Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)ATLANTA — The top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Friday to change long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed.
If approved by CDC leaders, the recommendations will also place a new emphasis on the risks of COVID-19 immunizations, despite the agency’s own data demonstrating that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people.
The panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. Several states —including Georgia, where the CDC is headquartered — have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, allowing the panel to play a key role in determining which vaccines are covered by insurance companies and how accessible immunizations are for the general public.
Though the panel did not withdraw an existing CDC recommendation that individuals between the ages of six months and 64 years get vaccinated, it does require “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and lowest for individuals who are not at increased risk.” For adults ages 65 and older, vaccine recommendations will be “based on individual decision-making.”
COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Americans is currently much lower than that of other immunizations, such as the flu shot. Only 13% of U.S. children were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines as of April, according to Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, who serves as the acting chief medical officer for CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Among adults ages 65 and older, that number hovers around 43%.
The CDC’s own data showed that COVID-19 vaccines reduced serious disease and emergency department visits among both children and adults. But during Friday’s meeting, some ACIP officials questioned — without evidence — whether COVID-19 vaccines provide any advantage to the people who choose to get them.
“What is the true efficacy and true benefits that these vaccines provide?” said Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Robert Malone, an ACIP member and biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” also pushed back on data showing that COVD-19 vaccines provide protection for the general public.
“There is no established correlative protection for COVID, period, full stop, and stop saying otherwise,” he said in a tense exchange with a fellow committee member.
Other public health officials criticized the proposed rule change that would have required patients to obtain a prescription before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
“If we start asking for prescriptions for vaccines, which are again, a primary prevention public health strategy, we are going to overwhelm physicians’ offices,” said Dr. Amy Middleman, who serves as a liaison member on behalf of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. “It’s alarming to me that for a primary preventive strategy, we are actually adding access concerns and barriers, rather than diminishing them.”
The committee also signaled that it would be open to revising current CDC recommendations that advise all pregnant Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Current guidelines state that mRNA vaccines are safe and effective for those who are pregnant, and can help provide immunity to babies under 6 months of age, who are too young to get vaccinated.
But Levi, who delivered a presentation that centered on the risks of COVID-19 vaccines, argued that current guidelines do not fully underscore the risk of adverse effects from vaccines.
“We decided not to bring it to a vote today, but we do hope that the FDA and the CDC will look much more carefully into this,” he said. “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence for not only pregnant women, but their babies.”

Mikie Sherrill (D) met at Rider University on Sept. 21, 2025, for the first of two scheduled debates between the two gubernatorial hopefuls. (Photos by Dana DiFilippo and Amanda Brown)Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Rep. Mikie Sherill (D) met on Sunday night for the first gubernatorial debate of the general election campaign, a 90-minute session that occasionally veered into testy but never devolved into an outright slugfest.
The event was a town hall-style debate, with questions from three moderators — including our own Sophie Nieto-Muñoz — and from audience members gathered at Rider University in Lawrenceville. Here are my takeaways, in no particular order:
 Joke of the night

Usually, candidates in a debate try to land jokes, but on Sunday, the debate’s host, Laura Jones with On New Jersey, easily had the best barb of the night when she said David Wildstein was not responsible for the bumper-to-bumper traffic headed onto the Rider campus before the event. Wildstein, editor of debate sponsor New Jersey Globe, was an architect of the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane closures that caused days of traffic jams in Fort Lee and led to state and federal investigations (Jones noted that Wildstein gave his OK for the joke).
 Did you know that Sherrill was a U.S. Navy helicopter pilot?

Sherrill had the microphone for all of nine seconds before she noted that she was once a Navy helicopter pilot, in case you missed that bit of biographical info from her campaign ads and her campaign logo and her million tweets about it.
 Political violence

In addition to being the day of this year’s first one-on-one gubernatorial debate, Sunday also saw the funeral for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose Sept. 10 killing sparked widespread condemnation and renewed calls to investigate and punish political violence. Asked whether they’d sign onto new GOP-led state legislation to label political violence a hate crime, Sherrill declined to answer, while Ciattarelli said he would and noted Sherrill’s evasive response.
Ciattarelli also used the moment to attack Sherrill for voting in favor of a House resolution honoring Kirk on Friday and later posting a message to social media condemning Kirk as racist.
“I think that was wrong,” Ciattarelli said.
“That’s a neat trick to say you don’t want to divide people, and then in your answer, bring up something that’s very divisive,” Sherrill responded.
 Jersey roots

Ciattarelli likes to remind voters that he’s a Jersey native and Sherrill is not (she’s from Virginia). He made a pointed reference to this on Sunday in a dramatic moment that saw him stare directly at her while he tied incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy’s support of offshore wind energy to the Democratic governor’s status as a Jersey transplant.
“Now if he was from New Jersey, and anybody who was from New Jersey would know, that the Jersey Shore is sacrosanct here in this state. Nobody wants wind farms off our Jersey Shore, male, female, young and old, Republican, liberal, conservative, liberal, for different reasons,” he said.
 Taxes

Wildstein asked both candidates a yes or no question: Would you commit to not raising the state’s 6.625% sales tax as governor?
Ciattarelli answered, “We are not raising the sales tax here in New Jersey.”
Sherrill (eventually) answered, “I’m not going to commit to anything right now, because I’m not just going to tell you what you want to hear.”
Her answer was notable because Sherrill spent a lot of the debate hammering Ciattarelli over some votes he made in support of raising taxes as an elected official. Her campaign has also circulated a misleading audio clip of Ciattarelli to claim he’d support raising the state’s sales tax to 10% and slapping it on food and clothing.
 Unanswered questions

Despite valiant efforts by the debate’s moderators and members of the audience to ask basic questions, the candidates skillfully avoided answering them when they didn’t feel like it, though it felt like Sherrill did this more than Ciattarelli.
The most obvious example came when the candidates were asked whether they would continue the Immigrant Trust Directive, an order from our attorney general that restricts when state and local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.
Sherrill answered by saying she would not allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to walk around masked and accused Ciattarelli of supporting policies that allow people in the United States legally to be detained. When pressed about whether she would continue the directive, Sherrill again declined to answer.
“What I’m going to do is make sure we’re following the law and the Constitution, so that’ll include due process rights and the Constitution,” she said.
Ciattarelli, who liked to remind the audience when Sherrill evaded a question, said, “I don’t think she answered your question. Executive Order No. 1 on day one, we’re getting rid of the Immigrant Trust Directive.”
 Segregated schools

The Sherrill campaign and her allies are making a lot of Ciattarelli’s answer to a question about segregated schools, one they claim reveals something far more sinister than I think it does.
The question was, would you as governor continue to fight a lawsuit filed by a group of parents and activists who allege the state’s school districts are unconstitutionally segregated and what do you think the state can do to achieve less segregated schools?
Neither of them initially answered the first part. Ciattarelli said he would focus on improving schools with “high-impact curriculum.” Sherrill said county-based school systems would help, as would high-intensity tutoring and phonics-based reading lessons in third grade. I’m not convinced these answers include a legitimate solution, though county-based schools might help if a Gov. Sherrill could get buy-in from towns (a gigantic if).
It was the initial part of Ciattarelli’s answer that won quick condemnation from Democrats.
“We do have the most segregated schools, but I wonder if we would be having this discussion if the performance of schools with predominantly Black student populations were outperforming schools with predominantly white populations. We need to get back on day one to improving all of our schools, and I intend to do that with a high-impact curriculum,” Ciattarelli said.
When I heard that, I heard him arguing that the problem is not segregation but terrible schools in districts that serve Black students. But a Democratic super PAC posted a clip of his comments — sans the bit about improving curriculum — and said, “Jack Ciattarelli defends racial segregation in schools,” a sentiment that appeared to be shared by some of Sherrill’s allies. Sen. Andy Kim (D) called the comments “shameful,” while Sherrill said Ciattarelli “doesn’t care about” segregated schools.
 Boos

No one asked about the issue of trans students in sports, but that didn’t stop Ciattarelli from shoehorning the issue in.
Ciattarelli, who has told voters on the campaign trail that he would ax a state policy that allows school officials to keep students’ gender identity changes from their parents, interjected his thoughts on this when answering a question about vaccines.
Sherrill said she’s worried that declining vaccination rates will lead to the spread of serious illnesses. Ciattarelli said he also finds the rise in measles and mumps cases concerning.
“The obligation of any governor on day one after they take their oath of office is the public health and safety, and we’ll do that under Governor Ciattarelli,” he said, then added, “I just wish my opponent showed the same concern when it came to biological males participating in female sports. We should be protecting all students.”
To my ears, the comment elicited the loudest set of boos of the night.
If the idea was to bait Sherrill into a response, it did not work. In her response, she attacked Ciattarelli for not criticizing Trump health appointees.
The two candidates will meet for one more debate in about two weeks.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ciattarelli-sherrill-2-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Via Karla Hernández-Mats)Educated We Stand, a national education organization founded to combat the influence of the conservative Moms for Liberty, have announced a new chair dedicated to tackling what she believes to be a “fascist playbook.”
That’s Karla Hernández-Mats, ex-president of the country’s third-largest teachers’ union and a former Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. The organization was founded in 2024 to promote the importance of public education, school board races, and taking on “far-right extremists” in the education sphere, their website says.
“I truly believe in public schools being the cornerstone of democracy,” Hernández-Mats told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview. “But we are seeing so many MAGA extremists attacking its foundation.”
Hernández-Mats, who takes over on Monday, condemned Republican officials for “spreading fear” by banning certain books in schools and “censoring” teachers and professors who have criticized conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on social media following his assassination. Although she denounced any speech inciting violence, noting that “senseless” attacks are dangerous to democracy, she stressed that expressing harmless opinions is a First Amendment right.
“I think if we just study history and we make sure that we’re not censoring history, that we are teaching it with authenticity, we will see that fascism has a playbook,” Hernández-Mats, 45, continued. “It’s occurred in many countries, and they attack education and they ban books, and they censor — this is part of the fascist playbook.”
Her comments came as dozens of public school teachers and university professors nationwide have been suspended or fired for either celebrating Kirk’s death two weeks ago or denouncing the conservative views he had held. 
It also follows a broader conservative education push from Gov. Ron DeSantis, who paved the way for the nationwide crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in higher education; pushed for legislation banning school books deemed inappropriate; and waded into school board races during his second term in office, overhauling the former non-partisan races into political affairs.
This gave rise to Moms for Liberty, a conservative parental rights organization that’s supported DeSantis’s agenda at nearly every turn. Founded in 2021, DeSantis has appointed two of its three co-founders to state commissions. He appointed another member to the State Board of Education. 
‘Front line fighting for democracy’
Hernández-Mats is a first-generation American of Honduran descent who credits her father, a farmer and carpenter, with teaching her the importance of getting an education.
“Education is the key to success, and that’s how you break cycles of poverty,” she said. 
The new chair has been highly involved in both the education and politics throughout her career, including teaching special education at a South Florida middle school, becoming Teacher of the Year in 2010, and serving as the President of United Teachers of Dade for nine years — the largest teachers’ union in the Southeast and the third-largest nationwide.
In 2022, she ran alongside former Gov. Charlie Crist as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.
Hernández-Mats hopes that Educated We Stand can expand into more states, highlight the importance of city and county school boards by endorsing candidates aligned with public school values, and quash right-wing advances into education.
“We need to make sure that people understand how school boards, which are often overlooked, are really the most important right now because they are on the front line fighting for democracy and for our children’s future,” she said.
She will take over the post from Jennifer Jenkins, founder of Educated We Stand and a Democratic candidate hoping to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody. 
Jenkins, who upset Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich in a 2020 Brevard County school board race, started Educated We Stand in 2024 specifically to combat that organization, whose growing conservative influence had stretched to 25 states and resulted in a roughly 40% win rate in school board races during 2022 and 2023. 
Educated We Stand has since raised over $375,000 in the past six months and has lauded its 78% win rate across endorsed races nationwide, boasting 27 school board incumbents on its website who won their races with Educated We Stand’s endorsement. During Florida’s 2024 election, 10 of 17 backed candidates won outright on election night. 
“We’re going to continue to raise flags and raise awareness so that we can be that stop gap in these moments where we’re seeing so much anti-public education rhetoric, and we’re seeing an attack on teachers, an attack on public schools,” Hernández-Mats said.
“We are about sharing dialogue. We are about sharing ideas and thoughts and opinions, and making sure that people are safe and are learning from that process.”

Lawmakers now anticipate costs to replace the bridge, which does not meet modern earthquake standards, could be around $10 billion. (Photo by Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)The torturously slow pace and increasingly expensive price to replace the Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River have some Oregon and Washington lawmakers growing uneasy and frustrated.
After years of planning and lining up billions of dollars in state and federal funding, it continues to be an educated guess when construction will start, how much the project will cost and what the new bridge will look like when traffic finally drives over it. 
Project planners had estimated the price tag for replacing the bridge would range from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with a likely figure of around $6 billion. But legislators said last week that they now expect the total could reach $10 billion as costs have escalated 30% on transportation projects in the Seattle and Portland regions in recent years.
None of this sits well with members of a bi-state and bipartisan committee tasked with keeping tabs on the megaproject’s progress. Meeting last Monday for the first time in 10 months, several didn’t hide their pique as they pressed the administrator of the Interstate Bridge Replacement Program for answers.
One Washington lawmaker is even suggesting that the project may need to be ended or dramatically narrowed, and has contacted the Trump administration to suggest pulling back previously awarded federal funding. 
In the meantime, the existing bridge is in danger of collapse in a major earthquake, and one of its spans is over a century old. Supporters of the project predict fewer crashes, faster commutes and more transit options when the new bridge is done.
A final environmental review for the project was supposed to conclude this year, Oregon state Sen. Khanh Phạm, D-Portland, told the committee. Completion is now expected in 2026. 
“I’m just concerned because this is driving up costs for Oregon and Washington taxpayers, and when we miss our deadlines, it really does have an impact on our transportation budget as we try to find the funding to make up for the increased costs,” she said.
Program administrator Greg Johnson acknowledged the timeline slipped, noting the environmental analysis must be finished before required federal permits can be obtained. He estimated it could be the middle of next year before initial work begins.
“There are complex issues we are dealing with. We cannot skip steps,” Johnson said.
If required approvals are in hand in 2026, as planners anticipate, cars could begin driving across a new bridge in 2032 or 2033.
Ever-changing price tag
Project planners now say that an updated cost estimate for the project should be completed before the year’s end, as staff examine “100 risk factors,” including inflation and tariffs.
Oregon lawmakers are in special session and expected to pass a major transportation package to raise $4.3 billion over the next 10 years for maintenance and operations of the state’s roads by the end of the month, pending one Democratic senator leaving the hospital. Nothing in the legislation is dedicated to covering increased costs for the interstate bridge.
In Washington, the Legislature enacted a six-year, $3.2 billion package for its transportation system earlier this year. It also contained no money for any escalation of the bridge’s costs.
At this point, financing is coming from several sources. Each state has committed about $1 billion. Tolls — which will be imposed in both directions on the existing bridge starting in 2027 and managed by Washington — are relied on for a minimum of $1.2 billion. Oregon has a moratorium on any tolls other than the bridge.
Federal grants totaling $2.1 billion were awarded last year under the Biden administration. Planners are pursuing $1 billion from the Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment Program. This would help pay for a 1.9-mile extension of light-rail from North Portland to a future station near Evergreen Boulevard in Vancouver, Washington. A decision on that funding isn’t expected until the project is further along.
Joe Cortright, the chair of the Oregon Governor’s Council of Economic Advisers, testified in opposition to the project during last week’s meeting. He said federal funding isn’t guaranteed as the Trump administration cracks down on federal grants. 
“It’s reckless to embark on this project before you know whether you’re going to get some or any of the billion dollars you’re counting on from the federal government,” he said. 
Washington state Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, in an interview afterwards, preached patience.
“I’m not thrilled,” he said of the slowdowns and unresolved issues. “This is a big, complicated project. There are going to be complicating factors. It’s the way these things go.”
Responding to concerns the Trump administration or the U.S. Coast Guard could make decisions that reduce federal support and add costs, Liias said, “We’re in the figure-it-out stage.”
Resources will be there to replace the bridge, Liias said, even if it means other pieces of the sprawling project are delayed. There are nearly 30 separate items — from new bus shelters to off-ramp improvements — in this endeavor.
Fans, foes and the future
Because the height of the bridge could affect ship traffic on the Columbia River, the U.S. Coast Guard is one of the federal agencies with sway over permitting. And the bridge’s final design may hinge on the Coast Guard’s input about accommodating vessels.
There are two main configurations under consideration for the replacement bridge. One design is for a single-level bridge with fixed spans, and the other is a single-level bridge with a movable span, similar to what exists today.
If the new span is a drawbridge, the vertical clearance will be 178 feet, as it is today. But the other potential design of a fixed span would have only 116 feet of vertical clearance. That would prevent vessels with clearance requirements greater than 116 feet from traveling under the bridge, absent some kind of mitigation.
Johnson, the program administrator, said a movable span would add roughly $400 million in costs.
Khanh Tran, an advocate for Oregon businesses owned by people of color, told the committee that replacing the bridge would benefit communities that have historically been left out of projects at this scale.
“A new bridge strengthens Oregon’s ties with Washington, supports interstate commerce and ensures we remain as a region a competitive global economy,” he said. 
But Washington state Rep. John Ley, R-Vancouver, an ardent opponent for years, said the lack of answers supplied as of last week solidified his stance that the project needs to be sharply scaled back — or even ended.
He said he reached out to U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to encourage him to scrutinize the project and consider clawing back the $2.1 billion in federal grant dollars — almost all of which has yet to be sent to the states. 
That could force leaders of the two states to reset expectations. Oregon and Washington could go it alone, he said, but it would mean ditching light rail and other bells and whistles.
“I think this is so far gone that the only way to stop this eight to 10 billion dollar boondoogle is to kill it,” Ley said.
Liias, the Washington senator, remains optimistic about the bridge replacement. “We are going to get to the finish line,” he said. “Leadership in both states are committed to getting it done.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/i5-bridge-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)It felt like a combination of a fast-casual restaurant, a health store and a mall pop-up shop, except at this retailer, you can buy what you need to get high.
Customers packed into the Brooklyn Park location of RISE dispensaries on its first day of adult-use cannabis sales on Sept. 17, one of the first non-tribal pot shops to open about two years after the Legislature fully legalized cannabis in 2023.
“I’ve been waiting for them to make it recreational ever since they opened,” said Elijshae Washington, a 29-year-old, stay-at-home mom who lives nearby. “It took way too long.”
Around 40 people stood in the adult-use line, which led to a long counter manned by nine staff members. The medical marijuana line had at most one or two customers at a time.
As those who have been to recreational dispensaries in other states can attest, the experience is about as far from buying weed from a guy in a gas station parking lot as you can get. It even stands in contrast to how THC gummies are sold at a gas station store, which is to say, just like how regular candy gummies are sold at a gas station store.
At a dispensary, however, “there’s more of the process of making sure it’s safe and everything. You kind of take a risk with it on the street, a little bit,” Washington said.
Prices, which ranged from $40 to $50 for an eighth of an ounce, are “a little high, but you don’t have to wait for anybody,” said Heather Hiivala, 54. “You can just come and get it, you know?”

The scene at RISE last week was just one of many all over Minnesota, where cannabis aficionados over 21 lined up at the first non-tribal recreational marijuana dispensaries. Though the state’s stoners have, for years, been able to legally grow weed, possess marijuana and buy THC edibles at thousands of breweries, gas stations and head shops, it was the first time non-tribal retailers could sell the real, green stuff — THC flower — at a dispensary to adults without medical cards.
The wait since the drug was legalized — edibles and drinks in 2022 and for real in 2023 — has been long. So far, two dispensary franchises have started selling recreational weed — Green Goods and RISE, which both previously sold only medical cannabis products. They join a handful of tribal dispensaries, such as NativeCare in Red Lake, which got a head start in selling non-medical cannabis thanks to compacts between Minnesota and tribal nations.
RISE delivered a streamlined experience complete with self-service kiosks and staff walking around with QR discount codes, dressed in purple tie-dyed shirts that read “Best Buds Forever.”
Customers perused one of several curated brand displays featuring empty product packaging — the drugs were kept behind counters — and merch on mannequins, including a dog hoodie on a dog mannequin. The store was oddly odorless.
It was a true 21st-century commercialized experience that almost makes you forget the real possibility of addiction and the risk of various side effects like respiratory problems (when smoking), lower neurocognitive functioning, especially for young users, and even psychosis.

Jesus Muñez, 24, usually buys THC edibles at a smoke shop in Blaine. Muñez said he feels more at ease with the process in the dispensary, which includes an ID check and sign-in upon entrance.
“I like that they’re able to show you the percentage of THC in it, too,” Muñez said. “A lot of places you go, it’s like: this is what we have, take it or leave it.”
Customers also said they were curious about the quality of the products.
“I’m kind of trying to see what this is like to see how good the flower is or not good it is, but we’ll see,” said Ray Lawrence, 41, who grows his own weed.
Lawrence expressed some pessimism on how the government will handle the nascent legal marijuana industry.
“I’m just waiting for them to screw this up,” he said, anticipating a rise in taxes.
As of a new law that took effect in July, Minnesota’s cannabis tax is 15%. After adding the state’s sales tax, the total tax rate for cannabis is around 22%, and higher in many metro cities. That’s the fourth highest in the nation, according to the Star Tribune. The hefty levy has some industry watchers concerned that if taxes and prices are too high, people will opt for the black market, which would partially defeat the purpose of legalization. 
On quality and taxes, the jury’s still out. (Feel free to write the Reformer a review of dispensary weed: AChen@minnesotareformer.com.)",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_1245-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

(Getty Images)Childhood obesity in Indiana is rising, and the latest data show a challenge that is both urgent and complex.
According to the report “Weight Trends Among Children and Adolescents within Central Indiana,” more than one in five Hoosier children between the ages of 2 and 19 were living with obesity, and nearly 4 out of every 10 children in the region were overweight or obese. The share of overweight and obese children rose steadily over the last decade, with much of the rise occurring during the pandemic years. While the data for this report focus on central Indiana, these findings mirror trends found across the state.
Of particular concern is that the highest increase in obesity prevalence was found in our youngest children. Obesity prevalence among children ages 2 to 5 grew by 83% from 2014 to 2023, with most of that increase occurring during the pandemic. Boys in this age group saw the sharpest rise. Racial and ethnic disparities are also clear, with Hispanic and African American youth experiencing the highest increases, highlighting broader social and economic factors tied to health.
The impact of obesity extends well beyond the weight itself. Children living with obesity face greater risks of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and orthopedic problems, along with psychosocial challenges such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and social isolation. These concerns ripple into schools and communities, affecting attendance, focus, and participation in activities. Without intervention, childhood obesity often persists into adulthood, compounding the risks for lifelong chronic illnesses.
The economic stakes are also high. Children living with obesity face an estimated additional $19,000 in lifetime medical costs compared with their healthy-weight peers. These expenses burden families and the health care system, while the human cost in lost health, confidence, and opportunity, is even greater.
It is important to recognize that obesity is not simply the result of personal choices. Research confirms that it is shaped by multiple factors: genetics, access to nutritious food, neighborhood safety, sleep quality, and opportunities for physical activity. Food deserts, limited access to recreational spaces, and economic pressures often overwhelm families’ best intentions.
Tackling the issue requires a broad, community-wide approach, and it must be done without shaming or blaming children or families. Every child deserves support, encouragement, and access to the resources that foster health.
What works
Evidence points to several strategies that can help reverse these trends:

Start early: Healthy patterns begin before birth. A mother’s diet and activity during pregnancy influence a child’s future weight and metabolism. For infants, feeding and sleep routines matter. Soothing without food and promoting adequate rest reduces risk.
Family-based approaches: Studies show that when parents and children make lifestyle changes together, results are more sustainable. Eating meals as a family, being active together, and modeling healthy behaviors support healthier outcomes. Family-based programs have helped children and parents maintain weight loss for up to a decade while also improving mental health.
Nutrition and access: Offering fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing processed snacks and sugary drinks has long-term benefits. Schools and youth-serving organizations can provide healthy meals, educate youth about food choices, and ensure that healthier options are the most affordable and accessible.
Physical activity: Children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of movement each day, yet only 23% of Indiana high school students meet this standard. Expanding safe spaces for recreation, partnering with parks and community centers, and weaving short movement breaks into classrooms and after-school programs can help.
Sleep and screen time: Insufficient sleep is linked to higher obesity risk even in infancy. Encouraging consistent bedtimes and reducing screen use improves both weight outcomes and mental health.

Working together
Reversing the childhood obesity trend in Indiana will require coordinated action among families, schools, health care providers, policymakers, and community organizations. Parents can model healthy choices, share family meals, and limit screen time. Schools can facilitate and promote daily activity and ensure that food served in cafeterias supports health. Youth workers can integrate play, healthy snacks, and positive conversations about wellness into programs. Health care providers can screen for obesity early and connect families to resources. Policymakers can address systemic barriers ranging from improving nutritious food access to investing in safe recreational spaces, to helping children access preventive and other health care services.
Indiana Youth Institute is proud to partner with Jump IN for Healthy Kids on the latest data brief that makes this growing problem clear. While these trends are troubling, solutions exist and are within reach for Hoosier children when we work together.
Childhood obesity is a statewide issue, but it is also a statewide opportunity. Indiana can create an environment where every child has access to nutritious food, safe spaces to play, and supportive adults who reinforce healthy habits. By working together and rejecting shame and blame, we can give every child the foundation for a healthier, brighter future.

Mike Braun, then the governor-elect, assembles the majority of his cabinet in December 2024 at the Indiana Statehouse. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun’s decision to give two of his top officials additional leadership posts has revived a longstanding constitutional question in Indiana: when can one person legally hold two government offices at once?
Last month, Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner was confirmed as the state’s next higher education commissioner, while also keeping her K-12 role. 
Just weeks later, following the abrupt resignation of Jennifer-Ruth Green, Indiana State Police Superintendent Anthony Scott was tapped by Braun to take on a second job serving as the secretary of public safety. 
Green stepped down amid an ongoing ethics investigation by the state inspector general into alleged ghost employment and misuse of state property. It’s now up to the State Ethics Commission to decide whether she violated state law — and what sanctions, if any, to impose.
Jenner’s salary will remain the same $275,000, according to the state’s online transparency portal. Scott’s compensation is expected to rise from $184,842 to about $275,000 — the same pay as other cabinet secretaries — Braun’s office confirmed.
Administration officials say the appointments reflect Braun’s broader push to make state government leaner and more effective.
“Gov. Braun campaigned on streamlining government and making it work better for Hoosiers,” said Griffin Reid, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. “Combining these roles is a common sense move that will save taxpayer dollars and improve service.”
What Indiana’s Constitution says
Indiana governors have occasionally consolidated power by stacking responsibilities on top officials — a practice sometimes referred to as “dual hatting.” 
Braun’s predecessor, Gov. Eric Holcomb, named then-Public Safety Secretary Rob Carter to also lead the Department of Correction in 2017.
And under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, some cabinet secretaries simultaneously headed state agencies such as the Department of Workforce Development and the Office of Management and Budget.

The Indiana Constitution prohibits most public officials from holding more than one “lucrative office” — meaning a public post created by law that carries a salary or other fixed compensation — at the same time. 
Article 2, Section 9 states that “no person may hold more than one lucrative office at the same time, except as expressly permitted in this Constitution.”
But that provision — in place since Indiana’s 1851 Constitution — leaves gray areas. 
Not every government job qualifies as a “lucrative office.” 
Some positions are created in statute with sovereign powers and a set salary, making them clearly covered. Others are more administrative, created by the governor without legislative definition, making them less likely to trigger the constitutional ban.
A “Dual Office Holding Guide” published by Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office lays out a four-step analysis to evaluate whether someone can legally hold two public positions at once.

Are both positions “lucrative offices” under Article 2, Section 9? If yes, the dual role is unconstitutional and must end. If not, move to step two.
Would holding both violate separation of powers? Indiana’s Constitution bars one person from exercising powers of different government branches simultaneously.
Are the positions incompatible or do they create a conflict of interest? Dual service is improper if one job is subordinate to the other or the responsibilities clash.
Is the combination prohibited by other law? State or federal statutes — including the federal Hatch Act — can separately bar some officeholders from taking another role.The guide cautions, however, that even if a dual role passes all four tests, it still may pose “public policy concern[s]” or risks of conflict that should be carefully considered.

Although the education secretary and the higher education commissioner are paid positions, which would normally raise red flags under step one, Jenner is continuing with one salary rather than drawing two paychecks. As such, the governor’s office held that the arrangement does not amount to holding two lucrative offices. 
Steps two and three also pose little conflict for Jenner, given that both of her roles fall squarely within the executive branch and share the same policy goal of overseeing Indiana’s education system. Additionally, no other state or federal law blocks the overlap, clearing step four.
For Scott, the position of ISP superintendent is created by statute and is clearly lucrative, while the secretary of public safety is a cabinet designation crafted by the governor. That makes it more akin to an advisory role than a separate office. 
Like Jenner’s case, Scott’s appointment passes the separation of powers test, and the governor’s team contends there is no inherent conflict since both positions share the same public safety mission. Scott, too, will be paid one salary, not two.
The governor’s rationale
Braun’s office has maintained that Jenner and Scott’s new assignments comply with this framework. Administration officials confirmed both appointments were reviewed under the four-step analysis.
Jenner, who now oversees both K-12 and higher education policy, additionally defended the combination as an opportunity for alignment across sectors. 
“Presently, in Indiana, about 60% of our budget is devoted to education,” she said shortly after her commissioner role was confirmed last month. “The opportunity we have in Indiana is to ensure we’re getting the best return on investment for those dollars,” she told reporters. “What is really working? What is moving the needle? Let’s invest more in that.”

Dan Peterson, chair of the Indiana Commission for Higher Education board, praised the move, too. 
“When you’re a great leader, you get more and more responsibility,” he told reporters. “This move, which helps bring the education vertical as close together as possible, makes a ton of sense.”
Scott, in a Sept. 9 message to state police staff, called his appointment “an opportunity [that] goes far beyond me as an individual and would not have been possible without ISP’s well-established commitment to professionalism, excellence of service and public trust.” He emphasized that greater collaboration across Indiana’s “public safety vertical” would benefit from the standards of the state police.
Still, Scott asked for patience as he learns to balance both jobs: 
“As your Superintendent, my commitment to you and to the Department will never waiver,” he wrote. “I do ask for your patience as I continue to navigate the responsibilities of this new position.”

At the League, we know kids and their families come first when making budget and policy decisions, and the Michigan they inherit will depend entirely on the investments we make today in their schools and neighborhoods as well as in workers and our economy. 
While the pandemic era saw incredible investment from 2020 to 2024 to help kids, families, and young adults cope with the disruptions, state and federal policy in 2025 has reversed course in a big way. The federal megabill signed into law in July saw the largest cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on record, programs that 43% and 23% of kids in Michigan rely on, respectively, to access health care and nutritious food. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The new Kids Count in Michigan data shows declines in infant mortality and teen births, high rates of health insurance coverage and improvements in access to prenatal care and lead testing, but these bright spots in the health domain may prove tenuous as the bill’s worst cuts take effect. The bill will devastate state funding with nearly $2.2 billion in Medicaid cuts alone while ripping away health care from over a million Michiganders in the coming decade. 
In addition, the bill cuts SNAP by over 20% over the next 10 years, taking away vital food assistance even as food costs and childhood food insecurity continue to rise. An estimated 74,000 Michigan adults — including 35,000 with children ages 14 to 18 — are at risk of losing food assistance because of new work reporting requirements. 
Federal budget cuts are not the only risk to a vibrant future for children in Michigan. The continued failure to pass a state budget threatens to deepen these harms.
Lawmakers in Lansing have neglected to pass a state budget on time, held up by an ongoing conflict on how to fund road repairs. But the solution to Michigan’s long-decaying roads cannot come at the expense of kids. The impasse continues to delay a state budget even as students across the state have returned to schools that remain in the dark about their funding future. 
While Michigan sees improvements in childhood health, education outcomes raise concerns

And now is not the time to ignore the needs of Michigan students. Education is the Kids Count domain that continues to see the worst outcomes, with third-grade reading and eighth-grade math scores down and fewer students graduating college-ready. In addition, the new data shows an all-time high number of students eligible for special education services, but the state continues to employ an inequitable funding formula that reimburses schools just 28.6% of special education costs. 
If we envision a future where families want to raise their children in Michigan, we need to be investing in a truly pro-kid policy agenda. This includes meeting families’ care needs, such as funding the true cost of early care and education as well as enacting paid family and medical leave for all workers.
A pro-kid agenda will also prioritize children’s health by offering continuous Medicaid coverage for young children, improving access to mental health services in public schools and increasing state spending on tobacco prevention and cessation. It will prioritize education by fully funding the Opportunity Index for schools with high levels of concentrated poverty and adopting universal free community college to help the state reach its Sixty by 30 goal.
A pro-kid agenda will also include young adults, who face the highest poverty rate of any age group but are currently left out of the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit. It will reexamine life without parole for emerging adults as research shows they are still in a phase of heavy brain development.
Finally, a pro-kid agenda will provide economic security for all families through the adoption of a Michigan Child Tax Credit and by improving access to the Family Independence Program, Michigan’s primary cash assistance program for families with very little or no income. 
The official deadline to pass a state budget is disappearing further into the rearview mirror with no compromise in sight, but now is not the time to forget the needs of our youngest residents. The 2025 Kids Count in Michigan Data Book and Profiles reminds lawmakers to look at the data when making decisions and provides recommendations into how we can prioritize kids in policymaking.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-979587826-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 07:58:01.039754

My first political contribution was supposed to be free — Minnesota promised to give the money back. Instead, I found myself staring at a paper form, dreading months of waiting for the check. I donated but never claimed the refund. If the process discouraged me, as an eager first-time voter, it’s no wonder so few Minnesotans use it.
The Minnesota Legislature created the political contribution program in 1974, a post-Watergate reform to curb the influence of big money and amplify the voices of everyday Minnesotans in state elections. It began as a tax credit and was converted in 1991 into the Political Contribution Refund, or PCR, with added spending limits for participating candidates. 
Fifty years later — and 15 years after Citizens United unleashed billions into politics — the PCR feels outdated: overlooked, underfunded, and sustained only by modest tweaks. 
Budget shortfalls repeatedly suspended the program from 2009 to 2017, and earlier this year, Gov. Tim Walz proposed eliminating it altogether as a cost-saving measure. But the PCR has survived, thanks to rare bipartisan support. Both Democrats and Republicans have long recognized that empowering small donors is common-sense politics. Last year, lawmakers raised the refund from $50 to $75 for individuals (and from $100 to $150 for couples). In 2025, the program is moving into the digital age with direct deposits for refunds, and a pending bill aims to create an online application system.
As Minnesota just begins to modernize PCR, 14 states and more than two dozen cities now offer some form of public campaign financing — ranging from Maine’s Clean Election Act, which lets campaigns run entirely on public dollars, to New York’s small-donor match that multiplies grassroots contributions, to Seattle’s Democracy Voucher Program, which gives every resident four $25 coupons to direct to candidates. 
Across the country, public financing has energized grassroots campaigns and opened politics to new voices. 
In New York, Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral campaign was powered by the city’s 8:1 match, multiplying small-dollar contributions that propelled his long-shot victory in the Democratic primary. 
In Seattle, democracy vouchers have drawn thousands of first-time donors, particularly younger, lower-income, and racially diverse residents — and just last month, voters overwhelmingly chose to renew the program. 
In comparison, Minnesota’s PCR has fallen short. Participation has plummeted: the share of eligible contributions refunded dropped from 58% in 2007 to just 13% in 2021; and in 2022, fewer than 1 in 100 Minnesotans claimed it. Even for those who know about the program, the hassle of upfront costs and paperwork keeps many on the sidelines — something online filing alone won’t fix.
In 2022, the Coalition for Integrity ranked Minnesota 13th in its State Campaign Finance Index. For a state that prides itself on clean and accessible elections, it’s a reminder of the room for progress, and the influence big money continues to hold on our state politics. 
From 2000 to 2022, independent expenditures in Minnesota rose from $3.7 million to over $63 million; in many races, and particularly the most important races, outside spending now outpaces candidate fundraising. 
At a time when Americans are more disillusioned by politics than ever, Minnesota can invest in reforms that level the playing field and restore confidence in our elections. 
The good news is this won’t require breaking the bank. The PCR costs under $2 million a year — a rounding error in Minnesota’s $66 billion budget. Seattle funds its Democracy Voucher Program at about $3 million annually, or just $8 per homeowner. For a modest investment, cities and states have delivered outsized returns: higher civic engagement and campaigns powered by people rather than wealthy networks.
Minnesota can follow Seattle’s lead, introducing a new model for public campaign financing. Instead of clinging to the rebate model, lawmakers should flip it: an up-front voucher system where voters direct coupons straight to campaigns. Minneapolis DFL Rep. Emma Greenman’s “Democracy Dollar” proposal pointed the way, though it stalled in committee in 2023. The bill didn’t pass, but it lays a roadmap for what’s possible. 
And lawmakers can go even further. That could mean pairing vouchers with a small-donor match to reward candidates with broad community support, or extending public financing beyond state races to city elections in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where outside money often drowns out the voices of residents. The goal is to evolve PCR into a broader system that makes participation easier and puts small donors at the center of every election. 
Minnesota once set the standard for fair elections. We can do so again — by reimagining the PCR to put power back where it belongs: in the hands of everyday Minnesotans.

By that time, signatures are due for the group seeking to force a referendum on the new congressional district map, intended to hand Republicans the 5th Congressional District. Missourians will also be voting at some point next year on new majority requirements for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative, and by that time the political alignments and funding for the upcoming campaign will be clear.
Finally, before the end of the year at least some of the court challenges being heard in Cole and Jackson counties will likely be through the trial courts and in the hands of appeals court judges.
Judge hears arguments in case seeking to toss Missouri’s new congressional maps

Richard von Glahn, a veteran of four initiative campaigns on minimum wage, is leading the effort to put the new congressional map on the ballot. If the campaign committee People NOT Politicians collects about 110,000 signatures by Dec. 11, the law revising the state’s eight congressional districts will not take effect until there is a statewide vote.
“In less than a week since this map was passed, we’ve had over 2,200 Missourians sign up to volunteer to gather signatures,” von Glahn said. “I’ve obviously been through this a couple times, but I’ve never seen the sort of groundswell we’re seeing now.”
The final verdict on the Legislature’s work will come next year, when voters would see the referendum, if successful, on a statewide ballot. The election would be held in November 2026 unless the General Assembly sets an earlier date.
That is also when voters will act on the measure targeting initiative petitions and perhaps a second proposal on initiatives, proposed by petition, to counter the one passed by lawmakers.
During the 10-day special session, Republican leaders changed the rules and shut down debate in the state Senate to pass the legislation. Now they must face the people, von Glahn said.
“It’s so clearly politicians not focusing on what Missourians want and need, but simply on what politicians want,” he said. “I think you’re going to see a huge outpouring of anger.”
Along with volunteer sign-ups, People NOT Politicians has raised $805,000 for the petition effort, including a $500,000 check from Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, a 501c4 nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors.
“I feel very confident, and we’re going to turn in the signatures needed by December 11,” he said.

 Initiatives campaign

The measure passed by lawmakers to change majorities for initiative proposals will appear on a ballot as Amendment 4. It will go before voters in November 2026 unless Gov. Mike Kehoe sets an earlier election date.
There are two campaign committees ready to oppose it, one supporting it and another trying to get an alternative on the ballot.
It would change the way majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition. Instead of just a statewide majority, initiative proposals would need both a statewide majority and a majority within each of the state’s eight congressional districts.
As few as 5% of voters could defeat initiative petitions under Missouri GOP legislation

That would allow as few as 5.3% of voters to control the outcome. Recent election results show that Missouri would not have legal marijuana, Medicaid coverage for working-age adults, sports betting or legal abortions if the proposed new standard were already in place.
The most powerful group, financially, working to defeat Amendment 4 is the Missouri Realtors, who in their internal blogging set themselves apart as a separate political party. They are building a campaign under the name Missourians for Fair Governance.
The Realtors have used the initiative process twice, in 2010 to prohibit sales tax on real estate transfers and again in 2016 to prohibit sales tax on services.
The initiative process safeguards industry and empowers voters to protect their rights, a recent post stated. 
“Efforts to weaken it or limit it are bad policy,” the post read. “They threaten the balance between lawmakers and the people they serve, while limiting Missourians’ ability to directly shape laws and constitutional protections.”
There are 25,000 Realtors in Missouri and fundraising by the organization’s PAC shows their financial strength. In the second quarter, the PAC raised $395,000, with donations from 648 realtors or affiliated employees.
Sam Licklider, lobbyist for the Realtors, told legislators in his testimony that the entire network would be activated to work against the initiative changes.
“We have somewhere in the neighborhood of $8,317,000, so we are well-positioned to ensure our arguments reach the public,” Licklider said.
The other opposition committee, in formation, is the Will of the People Coalition. Denise Lieberman, director of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, said it will bring together all the groups opposed to Amendment 4.
“The fate of Missouri democracy is on the ballot next year,” Lieberman said.
The committee supporting passage of Amendment 4 is Protect MO Voters, led by Andy Bakker, executive director of Liberty Alliance USA, one of many not-for-profit political organizations backed by the foundation established by the late St. Joseph business owner Stan Herzog.
The proposal on the ballot also bans foreign contributions to Missouri ballot campaigns, something prohibited in a law that took effect Aug. 28, and tightens rules for collecting signatures.
“We look forward to working with a broad coalition of Missourians who want to protect our initiative petition process from signature fraud and safeguard our constitution from foreign adversaries seeking to undermine it,” Bakker said in an email to The Independent.
The name chosen for Bakker’s committee is almost identical to the social media handle and hashtag identifier for Lieberman’s group. She said she expects a lot of traffic to her sites because of the similarity and welcomes the chance to get the opposition message out.
“So if you look up Protect Mo Voters, you’re going to get to the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, which is working to protect the citizens in this process,” she said.
Bakker, however, said the committee is just adopting the name for the amendment included in the legislation.
“Any confusion is being caused by liberals who oppose these common-sense reforms,” Bakker said.
The measure that will be Amendment 4 goes further in giving a small portion of the state a veto over the whole than proposals in previous years. A measure debated up to the final days of the 2024 session would have required a majority in five of the eight districts.
James Harris, a long-time Republican consultant and lobbyist, backed the 2024 proposal and this year’s measure for clients FGA Action and State Shield. He said the argument that will work best is one highlighting portions of initiative proposals that were not well known at the time of passage.
“Citizens will likely support this ballot measure because it will make common sense to them,” Harris said. “I have sat through focus groups, and when you tell them a little more about what they voted on, they are irritated by what they learn.”
The initiative proposal that would counter the legislative amendment is being circulated by a committee called Respect MO Voters. Instead of making it harder to pass an initiative, it would make it harder for lawmakers to change one after it passes.
Missouri Republicans shut down Senate debate to pass abortion ban, repeal sick leave law

Last year, voters approved an initiative that increased the minimum wage and required employers to provide paid sick leave. Republicans in the state Senate shut off debate to pass a bill repealing the paid sick leave and a provision adjusting the minimum wage for inflation that had been law since 2006.
Under the Respect MO Voters proposal, passage of a bill changing anything in a successful initiative would require support from 80% of lawmakers in both chambers and be subject to another statewide vote.
The Republican plan to increase the majority requirement found no support at the 25 town halls the campaign has conducted, campaign director Benjamin Singer said.
“What we kept hearing from people across the political spectrum at these town halls and listening sessions was that they wanted it to be as difficult as possible for politicians to repeal or change what the people decided,” Singer said.
The campaign is operating on a small budget, raising only about $280,000 so far. It is relying heavily on volunteers to circulate petitions, Singer said.
The similarity of names in the coming campaign may confuse voters, von Glahn said, but the issues should not.
“It doesn’t actually matter what political party you come from, Missouri voters like having power themselves. They want things that encourage accountability back to our needs and desires,” he said. “I’m not worried about people being confused by the different things, because a lot of it is actually from the same framework of a power grab by politicians.”

Proposition A, approved by nearly 58% of voters in November, gave workers one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked — about seven to eight days a year for a full-time employee. The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the law in April, rejecting a lawsuit from business groups that claimed it was unconstitutional and too costly. 
By repealing Proposition A, the Missouri legislature overrode both the will of Missouri voters and the state’s highest court.
At a time when communities are still recovering from the lessons of COVID-19 and other infectious outbreaks, repealing paid sick leave is dangerous. 
During the pandemic, I worked as an ICU nurse. We were eventually told we could come to work COVID positive if we had no symptoms, as long as we stayed masked. That decision kept hospitals staffed in a pandemic, but it spread risk to patients and workers. 
What we learned was simple: when sick workers can’t stay home, everyone is at risk.
Missouri has already seen the consequences when staff cannot stay home sick. By late October 2020, 1,241 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in the state’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities — nearly 46% of all COVID deaths at the time. State reports pointed to staff working across facilities, weak infection control, and policies that allowed asymptomatic employees to remain on the job. With residents already at high risk, outbreaks spread quickly and proved devastating.
Missouri voters expanded paid sick leave. The GOP undid it, and the repeal just took effect

Paid sick leave helps stop outbreaks before they spread. The CDC has found that it reduces infection in the everyday community spaces Missourians rely on — schools, daycares, restaurants and nursing homes. When that protection is taken away, families who depend on these places are more vulnerable.
For many Missouri households, two incomes are essential to make ends meet. Nationally, nearly two-thirds of mothers are primary, sole or co-breadwinners, according to the Center for American Progress. Without paid sick leave, parents risk lost wages or even their jobs if they stay home with a sick child. In rural areas, limited providers and long travel times make the strain even greater. 
Voters across party lines supported paid sick leave in Missouri. A 2022 Navigator survey found that more than 70% of Republican and independent voters supported paid family and medical leave. According to the National Partnership for Women & Families, more than a dozen states already guarantee paid sick leave, making it a standard workplace protection Missouri briefly adopted.
Missouri faces growing disparities in access to health care. 
Without paid sick leave, workers delay care and arrive sicker. Studies show that access to paid sick days increases use of primary care and reduces avoidable ER visits.
Rural Missouri is home to nearly one-third of the state’s population, and nearly a quarter of residents rely on Medicaid, compared to just 15 percent in urban areas. These pressures fall hardest on the state’s 35 Critical Access Hospitals, many chronically understaffed and underfunded. 
According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, From 2014 to 2023, 19 hospitals closed across Missouri, including 12 in rural counties. Those closures left 50 rural counties without a hospital, forcing residents to travel long distances for treatment. The facilities that remain operate on tight budgets and short staffing, and all 19 closures occurred in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas, underscoring how limited access to care already was in rural Missouri.
Supporters of the repeal offered two main objections. 
The first was practical: small businesses argued that even modest sick leave mandates increased payroll costs and complicated scheduling, a challenge felt most acutely by restaurants and nursing homes with shallow hiring pools. 
The second was philosophical: opponents insisted that the government should never mandate benefits, regardless of their effectiveness. 
Small business concerns deserve attention, but the long-term costs of high turnover, preventable outbreaks, and lost community trust outweigh short-term adjustments. Evidence from Connecticut, New York and California shows no negative effect on overall employment. 
Employers absorbed modest costs, often offset by reduced illness and higher retention. The business community itself was divided: Gina Meyer, owner of J E Meyer Construction Co. in Jackson County chose to keep offering sick leave voluntarily, while trade groups pressed for repeal. That split shows compliance was possible, yet organized opposition pushed ahead anyway, discarding evidence and experience to roll back a vital protection.
Health economists and Missouri health policy leaders warn that rural hospitals are already operating on razor-thin margins. Any spike in uncompensated care could tip them into collapse. 
Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president of health policy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, says many of the state’s 67 rural hospitals “operate on the financial edge” and are at risk of closure if coverage decreases. Without paid sick leave, more patients delay care or rely on emergency services, which adds costs to hospitals least able to absorb them.
Paid sick leave could have been phased in gradually or paired with targeted support for the smallest employers. Instead, lawmakers chose a full repeal, stripping away a safeguard against public health risks.
If the pandemic taught us anything, it is that sick workers forced onto the job do not just endanger themselves. We all pay when staff work sick. Hospitals absorb the costs, families absorb the risks, and outbreaks become a community-wide concern. 
Repealing Proposition A will not save jobs. It trades short-term payroll savings for higher infection risk, higher turnover costs and preventable harm in Missouri.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally10-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-22 06:58:21.388585

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
ICE arrests in Wisconsin from January to the end of July this year increased 22% compared to the same time period last year and most of that increase has come from federal authorities arresting people who have been charged with but not yet convicted of a crime, according to federal data compiled by the Deportation Data Project. 
Advocacy groups say the increase in arrests has sown fear and confusion among the state’s immigrant communities, and the intensity of ICE’s tactics have drawn attention and controversy across the country. But Wisconsin has thus far avoided the full brunt of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown compared to the state’s four midwestern neighbors. 
Iowa, which of the five states had the lowest number of ICE arrests last year under President Joe Biden, has seen arrests increase 293% this year under Trump. 
Illinois, where Chicago has become a focus of federal law enforcement and ICE activity, has seen ICE arrests increase 46% this year. 
Minnesota, despite its similarities to Wisconsin in  total population and number of Hispanic residents, has seen ICE arrests increase 95% this year. 
Last year, Michigan and Wisconsin had nearly equal amounts of ICE arrests. But under Trump, Michigan ICE arrests increased 152%. 

Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for Voces de la Frontera, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the administration’s tactics have caused fear to spread through immigrant communities across the state — even if the total number of arrests hasn’t increased as much as in other places. And while the numbers haven’t increased substantially, local law enforcement across the state has shown an increased willingness to devote resources to the federal immigration crackdown. The number of county sheriff’s offices participating in a federal collaboration program with ICE has jumped from nine to 14 this year. 
“In many ways it is like a psychological warfare that this administration has launched,” Velasquez said. 
Tim Muth, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Wisconsin, said the data can’t be used to predict future ICE activity in the state, but in the first eight months of the Trump administration, ICE is working with local law enforcement in ways that have terrified immigrants. 
“We don’t want to speculate on individual statistics or on what the future plans of the Trump regime may be, but we can say that increased collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE is instilling a sense of fear and instability in Wisconsin’s immigrant communities,” Muth said in an email. “We know they are ramping up their deportation agenda, and they are relying on local authorities to make it happen.”
Trump was elected after running on a platform of “mass deportations” and taking advantage of a backlash against a spike in the number of people making claims for asylum at the U.S./Mexico border under President Joe Biden. But Velasquez said it feels like ICE’s increased role is doing nothing to address the real challenges of immigration policy.
“There isn’t this thoughtful, strategic conversation, to really solve these issues,” he said. “It has been very radical, the way that it’s been enforced. So on the ground people have lost that kind of sense of let’s talk about solutions. It feels very reactive. People are not shopping, with school started again, there’s fear about ICE going into schools. It’s charged with anxiety and fear. It’s unnecessary suffering that is being caused statewide.” 
He points to instances in which people living in the country without legal authorization  have been arrested after showing up for court dates or been accused of bizarre crimes by the federal government. 
“What people are sensing in one way is this is a system that doesn’t make sense. It’s not working for us,” he said. “And then, on the other hand there’s people who are saying, ‘Well, I can be accused of any crime, and then I could just be detained.’”
The Trump administration and Department of Homeland Security officials have regularly claimed ICE is targeting “the worst of the worst,” rooting out violent criminals and gang members. But NBC5, a Chicago TV station, reported this week it could find no criminal record for people the department arrested on immigration charges, claiming they were violent offenders. 
Across the Midwest the increase in ICE arrests has been driven by targeting people who have been charged but not  convicted of crimes — a tactic that experts say violates due process and makes communities less safe. 
In Wisconsin, under Biden, 56% of those arrested by ICE were convicted of a crime and 9% had pending criminal charges. This year under Trump, 60% of those arrested have been convicted of a crime and 24% have pending criminal charges.

That data includes cases such as Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the Mexican immigrant who had appeared for a court date in Milwaukee County in a misdemeanor battery case when federal agents from ICE, the FBI and DEA arrived at the courthouse to arrest him. That arrest led to federal authorities charging Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan with a felony for allegedly obstructing the arrest. 
Nationally, 70.8% of people in ICE custody have no criminal convictions, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. 
“ICE will continue to prioritize the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have committed violent crimes, ensuring our children are protected and justice is served,” the agency, which did not respond to a request for comment, said in a news release on Wednesday about its arrests of six individuals without legal documentation convicted of sex crimes in six different states. 
While the administration emphasizes justice when it says it is targeting dangerous criminals, Muth said arrests of people not yet convicted damages the criminal justice system. 
“Picking up persons on ICE detainers while charges are still pending subverts the criminal justice system and deprives persons of their right to trial,” he said. “We also remain deeply concerned about the ongoing erosion of due process, as immigrants across the country have been abruptly rounded up by masked agents, detained and arrested without explanation, all while their families are kept in the dark about what’s happening to them. These horrifying scenes point to the federal government’s willingness to ignore the rights of immigrants and betray fundamental principles of our immigration system.”
Luca Fagundes, a Green Bay-area immigration attorney, says ICE operating in courthouses is the “easy road” for rounding up immigrants because people have little choice to avoid a court date — even if the crime is as simple as driving without a license, which immigrants without legal authorization to live in the country are unable to obtain in Wisconsin. 
“People are showing up to traffic court, and when their case is called their identity is confirmed, which makes it very easy for an ICE officer to detain them after leaving the courtroom,” Fagundes said in an email. “That person, who showed up for court (again, for perhaps something as simple as driving without a license) is now being arrested and detained by ICE. They will then be transferred to an ICE facility where they wait weeks or months for a bond hearing with an immigration judge. While in ICE custody waiting to see the immigration judge, they typically then miss the next court appearance they may have on their traffic court matter, and that results in a warrant for their arrest on that simple traffic matter.”
“It’s a domino effect of catastrophe for that individual,” she added, “and, if applicable, their family.” 
Velasquez said the modest increase in arrests here in Wisconsin has triggered fear. But he said successful organizing efforts to protect migrant farm workers and prevent more law enforcement from signing agreements with ICE may have helped stave off raids on farms and, for now, helped keep Wisconsin’s immigrant workforce safer than workers in other states. 
“There’s people who are being detained, so people are feeling it, regardless of the data,” he said. “But I do agree [about] the power of local communities being able to reject and say that we know  what’s best for our local communities. We’re not going to be seduced by money, by this administration. … We know our local communities better, and we don’t want our workers to suffer.”
“I think that there are powerful alliances that are being built across Wisconsin,” he continued. “That may be the reason why we haven’t gotten hit. But who knows — that could dramatically change tomorrow, right? So we do recognize the small victories, and this is good news, right? But at the same time, I think we need more dialogue. We need more common sense policies. We need more conversations of what we agree on.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)More of Indiana’s state agencies are earning approval for their mandatory expense-shrinking strategies — albeit with varying levels of enthusiasm.
Some have warned the effective 10% cuts could jeopardize statutorily required work, while others concluded their filings with cheery mantras.
“We realize that it is not about equal giving but equal sacrifice across our great state government agencies because we are ‘#INThisTogether,'” Department of Revenue leaders wrote. “We appreciate the partnership with the State Budget Agency and understand the monumental task that has been thrust upon you to provide the necessary guidance that will ultimately help stabilize our state government’s finances.”
A grim May revenue forecast prompted lawmakers to cut most agency appropriations by 5% in the latest budget — and authorized the State Budget Agency to withhold another 5%.
Agencies were required to describe how they’ll meet that target in “strategic spending reduction plans” due at the end of June. Gradually, they’re nabbing the go-ahead, and their filings are being uploaded.
Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute President Stephanie Wells celebrated the reports’ public availability.

“More transparency is always better — more data and more information on the decisions of Hoosier government is our preference,” Wells said, though she noted that “some are a little bit more informative than others.”
There’s a long way to go, however. Indiana is less than three months into its two-year budget; the fiscal year began July 1.
“I hope that they continue to report on the impact the holdback has made to the delivery of government services over the course of the biennium,” Wells said.
Personnel preoccupations
Many agencies with labor-intensive responsibilities noted almost all their budgets are spent on employees — leaving little room to slash expenses without reducing headcount.
The Office of Inspector General, for instance, reported that salaries and benefits account for 92% of operational costs. The office advises and investigates alleged wrongdoing to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in Indiana’s executive branch agencies.
“Despite efforts to minimize the impact, these budget cuts will inevitably affect the OIG’s ability to fully serve its core mission,” leaders wrote. 
OIG successfully requested an exemption from the 5% reserve standard.
Others are taking the hit.
Analysis: Latest Indiana budget drops spending 7% — with cuts ‘telling’

The State Personnel Department — the government’s human resources arm — and the Office of Administrative Law Proceedings also expend 92% of operational dollars on staff.
They planned to meet the reserve requirement with stringent, near-identically worded “position management strateg(ies).”
“Newly vacant positions will undergo formal review by (agency) leadership to determine if the position is critical or non-critical to operations,” their spending plans read. “Where appropriate, we will attempt to collapse the responsibilities and functions of vacant positions into existing positions, programs, or teams” before seeking to fill the roles.
Critical jobs can be filled — but first, must be vacant for at least 30 calendar days before posting.
“This will ensure at least 60-90+ days of cost savings,” the plans read.
Non-critical positions will be “deactivated” or kept vacant. If empty roles are still considered non-critical after 90 days, they’ll also be deactivated.
It’s unclear if all agencies are subject to this policy.
“Agencies weren’t directed to include a position management strategy in spending plans specifically. However, they were asked to address staffing with the expectation that requests for compensation or classification reviews would be factored into spending plans,” an SBA spokesperson said. “SPD is focused on helping agencies with strategic workforce management.”
The Department of Workforce Development is also downsizing.
It was dealt a whopping 27% cut in the budget, according to a Fiscal Policy Institute analysis, before the additional 5% reserve requirement. It also had a “sudden and unforeseen” federal funding drop.

Leaders, in their plan, explained that DWD’s funding and workload run “countercyclical” to the economy.
“In times of economic downturn, federal funding increases significantly; in times of economic growth, federal funding tapers off,” they wrote. “However, the associated workload of economic downturns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, often last(s) well beyond” the extra money’s end.
The agency’s workforce peaked in 2022 at about 1,300 employees but has since dropped. “Further reductions” are coming.
Leaders estimated a staff of less than 900 in 2025, but are “targeting pre-pandemic staffing-level costs.” Headcount hit a low of about 800 in 2020.
“That’s sort of indicative of how much — not all — of government works: you have to hire individuals to do the work,” Wells said. “… Personnel is, I wouldn’t say, the easiest place to cut, but it’s the most logical place to cut.”
The role reductions and vacancy policies are “very reminiscent of what was done during the Great Recession at a state level,” she said. She worked for former Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration during that time period.
“What I’ll be interested to see is when that stops — when we get back to the baseline, and then we slowly start to bring folks back into government and replace open positions in a more standard way,” Wells continued. “And that may not be this biennium. We’ll just have to see.”
Uniquely enough, the Public Access Counselor’s Office is betting on past underspending to “cut” costs. The office provides guidance on state public records and open meeting laws.

Former Counselor Luke Britt said his longtime deputy and administrative assistant left partway through 2024. He resigned in February this year. Gov. Mike Braun appointed new Counselor Jennifer Ruby in March.
“This office should not have fully used its payroll allocation,” Ruby wrote, but will need to spend to address its backlog.
Other savings strategies include having the Office of Administrative Law Proceedings pay for a part-time, temporary legal intern, and a part-time paralegal through next June.
Still, she asked for a waiver from the 5% reserve in order to pay for a senior attorney — who would “still be paid below average.”
Meeting that requirement would force the salary to an entry-level amount, Ruby explained. “This … would leave our office with no deputy PAC to support the operations to meet our requirements under Indiana law.”
Other entities primarily make grants. In its plan, the Commission for Higher Education celebrated that administrative costs are just 2% of spending in fiscal year 2026 — “well below the 4-5% industry standard.”
Contractor considerations
Agencies were required to take a hard look at their contract expenses in their spending plans. Some brought contracted tasks in-house.
The Department of Revenue, for instance, will take over paper check scanning for the Department of Child Services when its current vendor agreement expires in November, saving between $200,000 and $300,000 annually. 
DOR also plans to seek legislation “dramatically” reducing mailing requirements, like limiting the number of attempts to resend returned mail, and by letting Hoosiers opt into e-notices. The agency hopes to cut $1.75 million from its annual $3.5 million in mail expenses.
But there’s still plenty of uncertainty.
“A potential risk to our plan” is the legislator-authorized tax amnesty program, which is to be conducted before the end of next year. DOR asked for an exemption from the 5% reserve to fund that. “An additional risk” is that the agency may absorb all administrative functions for the Child Support Bureau.
Meanwhile, data-centric Management Performance Hub doesn’t have enough money to cover Informatica functions past March.

“We will be discussing ownership with (the Indiana Office of Technology), and agency stakeholders to determine the best way forward,” leaders wrote.
MPH also requested to hold $350,000 from the amount reverted to the General Fund at the end of last fiscal year. The agency is rushing to migrate its databases from one vendor to another before the end of the year to avoid pricey consequences. The move is expected to cost $400,000 to $600,000.
Missing that deadline would cost MPH an additional $490,000 to $610,000 in annual renewals. But to finish it all in time, the agency might need to lean on the vendors or other contractors — to the tune of between $200,000 and $250,000.
The State Board of Accounts was also hard-hit. The auditing entity’s workload increased 30% during the pandemic, and that won’t let up until the end of 2027, according to the spending plan.
That’s because the influx of federal spending came with new federal audit requirements and push many local governments past a federal spending threshold that triggered more audits.
“Reduced funding will directly lead to a reduction in the number of examinations that the SBOA can complete,” agency leaders warned.

To deal with the work, SBOA contracted private examiners. But to complete all statutorily required audits without contractors, the agency would need about 30 more field examiners. 
The spending plan listed challenges: a “significant reduction” in college accounting majors, the lowest number of Certified Public Accountant candidates in over a decade and experienced accountants leaving the field.
 SBOA also reported struggling to stay competitive with private sector starting salaries — and dealing with the “targeted recruitment of our most experienced auditors by private firms and other governmental units.”
The agency has no layoffs planned. It’ll keep hunting for new additions instead, and any reductions in staff will be based on attrition.
Exemption efforts
Requests for exemptions from the 5% reserve or other fiscal requirements were commonplace among the spending plans approved thus far.
For Wells, that’s to be expected.
“Of course, you’re going to ask for exemptions, as an agency director, where you can,” she said, “so that your operations can continue to function at a high manner.
“You might shoot your shot, as it will, and see what you can get.”
The Indiana Department of Health successfully requested an exemption to fund the licensing and surveying of healthcare facilities, according to the spending plan. That includes 173 hospitals, 157 ambulatory surgery centers, 225 residential care facilities, 246 home health agencies, 97 hospice agencies, 43 blood centers, seven birthing centers, and approximately 3,000 personal care services agencies.
The agency also makes recommendations on certifications for about 510 nursing homes, 6,900 laboratories, 161 end stage renal disease facilities, 46 outpatient rehabilitation facilities, 151 rural health clinics, and much more.
IDOH leaders said the agency wouldn’t be able to complete high-importance surveys quickly enough for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — “which could lead to them cutting agency funding to even lower levels.”
Not every waiver request is granted.
IDOH asked for an exemption from the Statewide Cost Allocation Plan, citing cuts in the federal funding that typically makes up a lot of the agency’s budget. The agency expects to owe the state $1.5 million in fiscal year 2026 because it is two years in arrears and because personnel expenses have increased.
The Indiana State Police also submitted a spate of exemption requests — some of which were granted, some in-progress and some seemingly denied.

ISP was one of the few agencies that got more money out of lawmakers. But some of its accounts still got cut, including Forensic and Health Sciences Laboratories, the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center and Indiana Operating/Motor Carrier Inspection. Those escaped the 5% reserve requirement.
Some money for drug interdiction and DNA sample processing will be held from the agency’s planning budget.
Leaders submitted several pages of detailed expense-cutting strategies, like bringing radio repairs in-house; fueling at ISP posts “when practical,” “avoiding excessive idling” and “always using 87 octane fuel.”

“Oconomowoc is a great place,” Kevin Ellis, an alderman on the Common Council and a member of the private fundraising committee, told Wisconsin Examiner. “It’s a great city. It’s one that I’m glad that I found 21 years ago.” 
While Oconomowoc — the city’s name is derived from a Potawatomi word meaning “where the waters meet” — isn’t known for gun violence, a member of the city’s fundraising team compared the purchase of the gear to buying insurance. During an incident in July, for example, a Shorewood officer’s ballistic vest reportedly prevented serious injury by gunfire. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
By the end of its fundraiser, Oconomowoc’s police department had far exceeded its $40,000 goal, according to a column in the Oconomowoc Enterprise by council president Matt Rosek.
While the new body armor has the potential to be lifesaving, some remarks about crime and unrest made by supporters of the fundraiser weren’t supported by data, records and past reporting reviewed by the Examiner.
Oconomowoc gun crime claims lack data support
Oconomowoc city officials announced their ambitions to augment protection for officers by fundraising for rifle-rated body armor inserts and pistol-rated ballistic helmets in early June. According to a budget priorities memo in May, Police Chief James Pfister said that with the right equipment, Oconomowoc officers can confidently respond to dangerous situations involving an active assailant. Officers could quickly assist victims, perform life-saving evacuations and effectively manage threats, “ultimately saving lives and reducing risks.”   
As the fundraiser was announced, however, members of the public took to social media to question the department’s efforts on Facebook. 
“I think more people would be happy to donate to the cause if we could have some background information,” one commenter, Morgan Murphy, wrote in a June 5 post. She asked what situations call for the new gear and how frequently those situations arise.
“If it’s a common occurrence shouldn’t there already be some on hand?” Murphy posted, wondering whether concern about such situations is increasing, and if the public should be concerned. 
City officials described the present moment as a “time of continued unrest and potential for escalated violence in our community and those around us” in a letter to potential donors, which the police department provided to the Examiner in June.

“Over the last five years, communities have seen a variety of incidents of unrest,” said Lou Kowieski, fundraising team member and former council president, when asked about the letter. He said he didn’t know if this would happen again, but that he wants the police department to be prepared. 
In a separate letter posted to Facebook, Police Chief James Pfister said the department had been responding to more gun-related calls over the past three years and that this was “a stark reminder of the growing challenges our officers face in keeping our community safe.”  
Wisconsin Examiner reviewed gun call data from the department’s dispatch center for June 2022 to June 2025, which did not show a definite increase in calls involving a gun. The number of “10-32” calls — police shorthand for gun-related calls — stayed the same from June 2022 to June 2025 at just under 40 calls or less. In order to give a more complete picture, the police department also provided data on all calls in which the word “gun” was mentioned, which rose slightly from 108 calls annually in the 2022-2024 years, to 119 in 2025. It is not known whether a gun was found at the scene in any of these calls. Neither data set includes information on the types of guns referenced in the calls.
Oconomowoc PD Captain Brad Timm said Pfister’s statement referred to the chief’s personal knowledge of “major gun calls specially from Target and Roundy’s,” and Timm said the equipment would be used for those types of calls. 
A shooting at the Roundy’s distribution center in Oconomowoc left the shooter and two co-workers dead in 2021. In a separate incident, a Milwaukee man was charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide earlier this year. The man reportedly pulled a gun out of his pocket and pointed it at a co-worker and a security guard at the Target warehouse in Oconomowoc, later telling police that he pulled the trigger and his gun jammed.
Wisconsin Examiner also requested crime data from the police department for June 2020 to June 2025. As requested, the data appears to break down reported crimes into 13-month periods, from the beginning of June of each year  through June of the following year.
The department reported more aggravated assaults recently, up from two in 2022-2023 to five in 2024-2025. An aggravated assault involves either the offender using a weapon, the offender displaying a weapon in a threatening way or the victim suffering obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury. It was unclear how many of those assaults involved a firearm. The department reported seven aggravated assaults in 2020-2021. 
The most recent data reported fewer weapon law violations than in past years. The weapon law violation definition involves the offender breaking a rule relating to a deadly weapon, such as a rule about the possession, manufacture or use of the weapon. The department’s data reported no murders or non-negligent manslaughters after two incidents that occurred in June 2020-June 2021.
 
 

 
According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, if a murder or assault involved a deadly weapon, it could also be counted as a weapon law violation. However, a murder, for example, would not be also counted as an aggravated assault. 
 
By comparison the police department for Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s most populous city, reported 132 homicide offenses in 2024 and has seen multiple gun-related officer deaths since 2018. The Milwaukee Police Department declined to provide the rating for officers’ standard body armor due to security concerns. 
Ricky Burems, who retired from the Milwaukee Police Department in 2014 with 32 years of experience, told the Examiner over text message that he used a vest that was resistant to AR-15 rounds. 
“A vest doesn’t make you impervious to gunfire,” wrote Burems, who worked as a plain-clothes drug unit officer and as a homicide detective. “It really hurts to get shot even if you’re wearing a vest. I recall a couple of officers who were killed when bullets went between the panels of their vests. But vests definitely help.” 
Oconomowoc’s Capt. Brad Timm said the rifle plate inserts the city was fundraising for are rifle rated, while the ballistic helmets are pistol rated.
In July, Timm said that most officers had a level-two bulletproof vest that protects against pistol-caliber firearms. He said at the time that when officers are hired, they are given a level-two vest, and the cost of more resistant level-three body armor would be the officer’s responsibility. Police departments in Madison and Milwaukee also allow officers to purchase more protective equipment on their own. 
Why did Oconomowoc pursue the gear this summer?
Wisconsin Examiner asked Timm what led to the fundraising push for more protective gear this summer. Timm said that “it was brought up to better equip our officers with higher rated ballistic head protection and vests, essential gear for high-risk situations.” 
In his June 5 column Rosek, the Common Council president who also recently announced he is running for mayor, said the fundraiser’s goal was to protect officers from high-power, large caliber rifles. While Oconomowoc is a safe place to live, there had been “several significant tactical situations over the last several years,” he wrote.
Rosek mentioned a bank robbery, a shooting at a Kroger’s, and a shooting incident on the overpass at Interstate 94 and Highway 67. Since Roundy’s is a subsidiary of Kroger’s, Rosek, who did not respond to the Examiner’s requests for comment, might have been referencing the 2021 shooting at the Roundy’s distribution center. Waukesha County court records show that the bank robbery incident involved suspects with pistols, which the department’s standard body armor should be rated to withstand.

In the May 6 budget memo, Pfister said that “recent events, like those at the Oconomowoc industrial facilities, sadly underscore the urgent need for advanced gear to keep our officers safe.” 
While the Target distribution center incident took place earlier this year, it appears the bank robbery, overpass shooting and Roundy’s shooting occurred prior to 2022. Lou Kowieski, a fundraising team member and former council president, told the Examiner that he didn’t think there was a correlation between the incidents mentioned by Rosek and the police department’s request for protective equipment. Kowieski said he thinks “those incidents help provide, unfortunately, the real-world scenarios of where those are needed.” 
Kowieski also referenced the July shooting that injured a Shorewood officer, and said that “in general, not just in Oconomowoc but in multiple communities, that threat level of use of firearm power is there.”
“You’re going to get insurance for tornadoes,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that you’re going to have a tornado tomorrow. But if it happens, you need to make sure you’re covered.” 
Timm was unable to give an exact number of the calls or incidents the department had responded to that involved a type of firearm their current gear wasn’t rated for, and for which the new gear would have provided sufficient protection. Asked whether or not he could say this type of situation had occurred at all in the last several years, Timm only replied “Yes.” 
Supporters cite mutual aid, 2020 unrest and protests
Rosek’s column also mentioned the potential for Oconomowoc officers to be deployed outside of Oconomowoc, without mentioning any specific city or situation.
“We also know that our police officers will respond to situations outside of our community if called upon,” Rosek wrote. “Violent situations put our officers at greater risk than we have seen before.”
Asked if Oconomowoc has sent officers to assist other communities in need of additional officers for an incident in the last several years, Timm replied “Yes.” 
Kowieski said that not too long ago, officers from Oconomowoc helped support situations in other communities, such as Wauwatosa, Racine and Kenosha “when the social unrest became a challenge for all police departments.” Kowieski said this connects to the fundraiser because it helps prepare the department to provide mutual aid when requested by other communities in various scenarios, including civil unrest or school shooters.

Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the Wauwatosa Police Department about whether OPD had assisted them since 2020. A spokesperson said that to the contrary, Wauwatosa officers assisted OPD in 2021 during an incident at Roundy’s, but that there are no records showing Oconomowoc officers assisting during situations in Wauwatosa. 
If concern about protests and unrest are causing the city to procure the equipment, John Norcross, who lives in the nearby village of Lac La Belle, thinks “we ought to have a public conversation about that.”
A community Facebook page, “Oconomowoc Supports Our First Responders,” also suggested the gear would help keep officers safe during protests and unrest, specifically mentioning civil unrest that took place in Kenosha during a summer of nationwide protests over police violence and misconduct. The post mentioned Black Lives Matter protests organized in Oconomowoc’s Fowler Park and stated that “5 years ago this summer the threads of our community fabric were at a breaking point.” 
The Fowler Park protest, however, was peaceful, as were most Black Lives Matter protests across the country, according to a 2020 University of Connecticut study.
Norcross thinks the reference to the Black Lives Matter protest feeds an unfounded fear that any kind of protest has the potential to create social unrest. 
“I was at the BLM protest in Oconomowoc,” Norcross said. “There was absolutely no fear, no fear of any social unrest from that. But I do sense that [there is] rhetoric of using Kenosha for years as a keyword for, ‘Hey, we need to be careful. We need to be armed. It could happen at any moment.’”

Mutual aid documents from the curfews in Kenosha and Wauwatosa do not list the Oconomowoc Police Department. Although records from Wauwatosa documented a single Oconomowoc police captain as being present in or around the command center, it does not appear that the department had an on-the-ground presence during Wauwatosa’s curfew. 
Two people were killed and another severely injured in Kenosha after heavily armed teenager Kyle Rittenhouse fired an AR-15 style rifle at protesters. No gun violence or deaths occurred during the curfews in Wauwatosa or Milwaukee. (Rittenhouse was acquitted of charges related to the shootings in a jury trial.)
Fundraisers ‘freed up’ tax dollars for other needs
In a column on Aug. 28, Rosek wrote that he was asked why the city hadn’t added the purchase of body armor to the 2026 budget. 
Rosek’s June column praised the police department for providing “24/7 patrolling,” a citizen’s academy, and other services. “There is no question we are a safer community because of their commitment to our citizens,” he wrote. “Our police department is completely funded by our property tax dollars and is the largest single spend we have in the annual budget.” 
Rosek wrote about previous fundraising, stating that “most of the funding for the body cameras ($150,000) and for the K-9, Gabo, ($125,000) was privately fundraised.”  
In memos from May 2025, where various parts of the Oconomowoc city government shared budget priorities, the police department included about $37,000 in body armor inserts and ballistic helmets. 
Rosek’s column, published a month later, said that the department is funded by a tax levy which comes with restrictions. Sometimes, this means “certain initiatives need some help to get over the finish line,” he wrote.

But when Wisconsin Examiner asked Oconomowoc police captain Brad Timm in July if he believed the city would still buy the equipment if it could not fundraise in the community, he said yes. Community fundraising is the quickest way to obtain the equipment, Timm said, and without a fundraiser the equipment would have been requested in the 2026 budget. 
The police department didn’t respond to some of the Examiner’s questions, including whether donors were informed that the city could afford to purchase the body armor inserts and ballistic helmets through the budget, and that private fundraising was chosen because it was quicker. 
Jerry Wille of the Oconomowoc Lions Club, which donated $10,000 to the fundraiser, said that “budgets are very difficult in today’s world. So we don’t really worry about that. We know if there’s a need, as a Lion we’re there to help.”
Timm said he believed the city would have made the body camera purchase without the donations from the community, but was unsure about the K-9. He said that the body camera and K-9 fundraisers freed up taxpayer money for other city budget items.
In his column on Aug. 28, Rosek wrote that the city could have funded the protective gear, the body cameras and the K-9 officer through the budget, but that fundraising for one-off purchases “frees up more tax dollars to commit to other critical needs.” 
Part of a trend
Oconomowoc’s use of donations when purchasing protective gear for law enforcement is not unique. In 2018, the Green Bay Press Gazette reported that 50 law enforcement officers in Oconto County had gear providing protection from long guns, using donations from businesses, organizations and individuals. 
Purchases for protective gear were also made by the Milwaukee Police Department and Dodge County Sheriff deputies. The Milwaukee Police Foundation, which has operated since 2019, has also raised private funds to upgrade surveillance cameras, technology used to track phones and body cameras. 
Large donations were also made by the Green Bay Packers and PESI, Inc. toward body cameras and other equipment for the Green Bay Police Department and for Eau Claire police officers and sheriff’s deputies.
Fundraisers also help build relationships between the community and the police, said Lou Kowieski, the fundraising team member and former council president. “You can’t put a value on what the relationship between a community and a police department is,” Kowieski said. In communities without that strong bond, “You feel less safe living in those communities,” he said. “In Oconomowoc, we’re very fortunate and very blessed to have a strong sense of community that is outwardly and proudly supporting our police department and all of our first responders.”

In a statement to Wisconsin Examiner, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin highlighted issues with police fundraisers for equipment. 
“When police acquire new tools through private funding, it raises serious transparency and oversight concerns,” the ACLU stated. “Equipment purchased with private donations receives less scrutiny and examination into whether that technology is appropriate and necessary in a community. Private donations bypass public discussion and necessary public notification about why law enforcement needs the tools and how they will be used.” 
The ACLU statement added that, “with the rapid rise of new, high-tech police and surveillance technologies, it’s never been more critical for people to know how they’re being policed. However, when private donors pay for that equipment, the public is completely cut out of the process. Police should be beholden to the communities they are sworn to serve and protect, not the interests of private donors who may pledge the money with strings attached.”
With the exception of Kevin Ellis, members of the Oconomowoc Common Council did not comment for this article. 
As of Aug. 28, the fundraiser had raised $53,000, with additional funds still coming in. The team said it plans to use the extra funds to equip community resource officers. 
Rosek said the next fundraising event will be for Western Lakes Fire Department, which he said has critical needs in the next year. In 2022, seven Waukesha County communities considered a referendum that called for nearly doubling the annual budget for the Western Lakes Fire District. The referendum failed, but the city of Oconomowoc was one of the two municipalities where voters supported it.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Each year, Oklahoma leaders seem content to let June pass by without ordering our states’ flags be lowered in remembrance of one of the worst acts of racial violence in our nation’s history: the Tulsa Race Massacre.
In fact, for at least the past decade, a review of state records shows governors haven’t typically issued executive orders requiring flags be lowered to half-staff to commemorate the anniversary of the attack, including during the 100th anniversary events in 2021 that drew thousands to Tulsa.
The omission feels purposeful. Oklahoma officials lower flags frequently to memorialize the fallen of Sept. 11, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Pearl Harbor attack, the Vietnam War, Peace Officers Memorial Day and for federal holidays such as Veterans Day and Memorial Day. We, as a state, show this sign of reverence after the deaths of state and federal officials, judges, firefighters, soldiers, astronauts, law enforcement officers and even students killed in mass shootings at schools outside of Oklahoma.
But not  on June 1 each year. That’s the date of the culmination of a white mob looting and burning 35 blocks of homes and businesses in Tulsa’s affluent Black neighborhood of Greenwood from May 31 through June 1, 1921. Until then it had been a Black cultural and economic hub known as “Black Wall Street.” Records show at least three dozen residents were killed, but some estimates indicate that the number of dead could be in the hundreds. Up to 1,200 homes were destroyed.  
Apparently, June 1 is a day that many of our state leaders would rather forget.
So a pastor in Tulsa believes she should take matters into her own hands to force our state to remember those victims, too.
Francetta L. Mays, who works at Vernon AME Church in Greenwood, is running a petition to get a measure on the ballot that would designate June 1 each year as “Greenwood Remembrance and Reconciliation Day.”
And this isn’t just to remember history from a century ago. There are believed to be at least two survivors still living. Experts, including the University of Oklahoma’s Oklahoma Archaeological Survey, have been excavating a cemetery in the area to search for more victims who might have been killed to get a more accurate count of the deaths.  Some historians say that some victims were hastily buried in unmarked graves and the true death toll may be much higher.
Passing a law creating a day of remembrance seems like something lawmakers could easily do to acknowledge the event. Instead, Mays is being forced to collect over 92,000 signatures to even get the measure before voters.
It’s puzzling in a state whose lawmakers are willing to commemorate many others who were slain.
If you don’t believe me, check out what they’re already trying to do to honor Charlie Kirk, the close ally of President Donald Trump, who was assassinated while holding an event at a Utah college this month. 
Kirk hadn’t even been laid to rest in his home state of Arizona before Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, filed legislation to declare Oct. 14 as “Charlie Kirk Free Speech Day.” He also filed a bill that would require every public college and university in the state to develop a prominent area and name it the “Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza.” Additionally, he wants these institutions to erect a statue of Kirk. He’s also filed a proposal  seeking to recognize Kirk as a martyr for “truth, faith and free speech.”
The Oklahoma State Republican Party, meanwhile, wants lawmakers to create a state holiday in Kirk’s honor, with the party chair saying that “we feel like his death should be commemorated and is no different than Martin Luther King, or any other civil rights activist.” 
Let’s not forget that Oklahoma doesn’t have state holidays to honor former U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln, who were both assassinated, and also very influential in their own ways. Lincoln, after all, is credited with helping end slavery in America.
Our leaders can muster up the energy to honor Kirk, but we can’t do the same to honor the victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre — people who lived here?
It doesn’t seem that complicated. In fact, it seems laudable.
But perhaps it’s easier for lawmakers to ignore this night of terror. We’re a state, after all, whose lawmakers passed a law that bars teaching topics that cause feelings of “discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress.”
This is a legacy that causes discomfort, and we’ve treated it like a dirty family secret. 
It wasn’t until the 100th anniversary of the rampage approached that I learned about it for the first time. Historians believe the incident was sparked by a 19-year-old Black man accidentally stepping on the foot of a 17-year-old white female elevator operator. Misinformation quickly spread about what happened in that elevator, and a newspaper reported that the man had attempted to sexually assault the teen. Historians say the paper also published an editorial promoting lynching.
It took decades before the massacre was first required to be taught, but in 2002 there was little guidance about how it should be taught. In 2019, education leaders fixed that to include required content in various grades. Sometimes I wonder though how those lessons can be taught without running afoul of state law.
It seems like lawmakers are A-OK with remembering one horror, Charlie Kirk’s killing, over another, the race massacre.
If that’s the case, that leaves us with a quandary. How should we choose the lives we remember and honor?

But the updates, in the form of the new Sentinel missiles,  are running years behind schedule.
The post Wyoming could be the ‘guinea pig’ as U.S. modernizes its nuclear weapons appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. is in the process of updating hundreds of nuclear missiles, and Wyoming may be the “guinea pig.”
“There’s going to be a lot of lessons learned from this process that are, then in theory, going to be transferred down to Montana and then to North Dakota,” said Matt Korda, associate director of the Nuclear Information Project with the nonprofit Federation of American Scientists.
F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, which oversees missiles, will be the first to see changes, he said, including more communication towers and land easements. 
But the work is years behind schedule. 
Cold War-era Minuteman III missiles in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming were supposed to be replaced with new Sentinel missiles by 2029. Now that may not happen until 2033.
“Whenever a country says we’re going to build a new nuclear related system by a certain date, you can probably add a few more years onto that,” Korda said during a Q&A session hosted by WyoFile.
He added that the U.S. government is millions of dollars over budget, and is now extending the life of the old missiles, since the new ones aren’t ready.
“All of these delays and these cost overruns are ultimately going to trickle down to people who live in these states  and, really, to Americans who pay taxes,” Korda said.
Korda sat down with Wyoming Public Radio News Director Kamila Kudelska to talk more about the Sentinel project’s potential impacts on Wyoming. 
Editor’s Note: This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

Kamila Kudelska: I’m eager to pick your brain about nuclear weapons in Wyoming, but first, let’s get some context. You are one of the authors of the Nuclear Notebook, which puts together estimates of nuclear forces and trends around the globe. What’s the big picture from this year so far?
Matt Korda: All nuclear armed countries, all nine countries with nuclear weapons, are currently modernizing their nuclear arsenals. What do I mean by modernizing? I mean that either they are qualitatively improving the types of weapons that they have, or they’re quantitatively increasing the number of nuclear weapons in their stockpile.

KK: Wyoming has played a role in the nation’s nuclear weapons program almost since the beginning. Can you give us some context of what the role of the F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne has been?
MK: Wyoming is really at the heart of the United States’ land-based nuclear missile component of the triad. The U.S. refers to its nuclear weapons as composing part of this triad of land, air and sea. Wyoming plays a really big role in the land-based part of that program because there are 150 silos that are deployed around the F.E. Warren Air Force Base.
KK: And what is a silo?
MK: It’s a big hole in the ground where missiles, which carry nuclear weapons, are placed into. These are something that the U.S. has had in its arsenal for the past 50, 60 years, and this modernization program that the U.S. is embarking on is going to have them for the next 50, 60 years, as well.
KK: The United States modernization effort, as I understand, it’s from the new Sentinel Nuclear Missile Program. Wyoming, along with Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Arizona will get new intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS, or provide support. Where is the project currently?
MK: This program has been in progress now for the past maybe 15 years or so, and this is kind of just the nature of nuclear weapons programs. They take a really long time to build.
Where we’re at right now with the Sentinel is really challenging. It sort of seems like every month we get this new update as to how the missile program is either behind schedule or over budget, or there’s some other sort of thing that’s happening, whether it’s relating to mismanagement of the program, poor contractor performance, that sort of thing. This has created a lot of problems.
The initial plan for this program was to reuse a lot of the old silo infrastructure. There’s already been a ton of construction that was done during the ‘70s to build all of these different silos and place them into these various states. The hope was to save as much money as possible and reuse a lot of that infrastructure, and then just put a new missile into the same silo.
What the Air Force is now finding is that this is basically impossible. This program was sort of accelerated in many ways, but before the analysis was fully baked. And so what’s happened now is acquisition costs of the program have risen to 81% over the baseline. The original acquisition costs were supposed to be somewhere in the realm of about $77 billion in 2020.
Now we’re at about $140 [billion], and what’s happened is that that has triggered a breach of what’s called the Nunn-McCurdy Act, which is this act in Congress that says you’re not supposed to go 25% over budget. If you do go 25% over budget, then the program basically has to be scrutinized really heavily by the Department of Defense.
There’s a lot of work that has to be done to change things. We’re seeing that there’s gonna be a lot more construction than originally planned, because these various pieces of the silo that they thought they could reuse, they can’t reuse anymore. What this means is that some of these costs are going to trickle down to taxpayers.
In addition, there are challenges with landowners, because the plan was originally that the Air Force was going to just use the same kind of cabling that already exists underground for the new silos. Now that that’s not possible, they have to go and dig new holes, new passageways for the cabling.

Warren Air Force Base had the two conduct the test in tandem with an associated launch control center in Nebraska. (Staff Sgt. Christopher Ruano/U.S. Air Force)

This is going to require more land that gets leased to the Air Force by local farmers and ranchers, and other folks who own that land. The Air Force is preparing to go around to these different folks who own this land and basically offer to buy it. It’s likely going to be that the landowners probably have no choice but to sell to the Air Force because this is the land that the Air Force needs for this missile program, and historically that’s how it’s worked.
KK: What’s going to come to Wyoming as a result of this project?
MK: In terms of the construction, there’s gonna be a lot of on-base construction at F.E. Warren. They’re producing a lot of buildings and things like that, new facilities that are meant to help test out the new system, that sort of thing.
There’s gonna be a lot of construction off-base as well. I mentioned that there’s going to be these new easements that are required for the new cabling.  That means that folks are going to have to sell their land to the Air Force to allow the Air Force to come in and add new fiber optic cabling underground, that sort of thing.
In addition, we’re going to see a lot of these new construction camps that pop up in the area. There’s a bunch of small ones that are coming and there’s going to be one big one coming to Kimball, Nebraska, which is quite close by. That new workforce hub is going to have approximately 2,500 to 3,000 people that are going to be added into the community.
What’s really interesting is that the Air Force completed what’s called an environmental impact statement (EIS). They talk about how the program is going to impact the local ground squirrel population and all these things. 
But what they also do is they talk about how it’s going to impact local communities. They have all these statistics on how adding this kind of influx of folks into the area is going to impact things like housing costs, rental costs, crime rates, noise, things like that, where it kind of goes down the list. The statement itself notes that there’s likely to be adverse effects to things like socioeconomics because folks are going to come into the community, and public schools will be even more in demand. So there’s things like that, that do tend to get affected when you have these major construction projects.
KK: Do we know the timeline?
MK: The plans are for about three to five years. It’s already kind of starting.
KK: You mentioned the construction site in Kimball, which is about 20 miles from the Wyoming border and about 40 miles from Cheyenne. And that could cause these local impacts, like housing and crime issues, potentially. How much say will the state or local communities have?
MK: In some ways, not a ton.
The way it’s [this project is] sort of described is that it’s too big to fail. A lot of money has already been sunk into it. It’s really challenging to push back against that. It’s challenging to even ask questions, I think, that are very reasonable: Why are we so over budget? Why are we so behind schedule? Why are landowners going to have to have these impacts to them that they didn’t anticipate? Those type of questions I think are really valid and it’s tough to even get concrete answers about those things.
What’s historically happened is that when the Air Force was figuring out where to base their missiles back in the ‘60s, local landowners did not really have a ton of say in where those missiles would be placed. It did create quite a bit of tension between local landowners, who in many ways are actually quite supportive of the military and quite supportive of the nuclear complex, but did resent the fact that there was this faceless bureaucracy that would come down and say, ‘We’re putting a missile next to your house. It’s going to devalue your land, and there really isn’t that much you can do about it.’
There are ways right now in which local residents can engage with the Air Force, and they’ve set up a hotline and there were these public town halls and things like that for folks to go and ask their questions. These are all public record, and so we can see the types of concerns that people have had. 
The big question is, are those concerns going to be taken into account? At least historically, they really weren’t. There’s one anecdotal instance in which the Air Force in the ‘60s sited a missile silo within spitting distance of someone’s house. And then when that family complained, the Air Force said, ‘Okay, then move. We’re not moving our missile. You have to move instead.’
I would hope that maybe there’s some lessons learned from that this time around, but it’s hard to know exactly how the process will go.
What we do know is that they’ve already begun to engage with local landowners. A letter was sent out from the Air Force to folks in the area surrounding F.E. Warren as recently as May of this year. It basically said, ‘Hey, we are about to start this process for the conversion of these silos. This is going to involve us acquiring more easements, and so we will be in touch shortly about how to evaluate your land and we will try and offer you fair market rate,’ and that sort of thing.
KK: You mentioned that there has been some public meetings and some concerns were raised. Do you know what those concerns were? 
MK: You can bundle them into a few different categories.
Some are just folks writing in and saying, ‘I live nearby and I just wanna stay informed.’ 
You’ll have some folks who are saying, ‘I’d really prefer that you don’t build on my land. There’s some much better land over there – my neighbor’s land, you can build over there.’
Instead, there are folks who are writing in, who have legitimate questions and concerns about the ecology in the area. They’re saying, ‘There are endangered plants and animals and trees and things like that. Is the construction going to disrupt those ecosystems?’ The Air Force has stated through their environmental impact statement that it will disrupt some of those endangered species, and so people have a lot of fair questions about that.
Then there’s other people who are writing in who are saying, ‘I support this project, I wanna learn more about it. How can I help?’ It’s actually a really wide range of things.
KK: What do you see as the benefits and downsides of this program?
MK: In terms of the benefits of this program, it fits what the U.S. deterrent strategy is right now. When you think about what nuclear weapons are for, you can really fall into a couple of different camps here. 
One is just that the mere presence of nuclear weapons is enough to make your adversaries think twice about wanting to launch at you. So in that sense, if you only have a couple of hundred nuclear weapons, that’s probably enough.
The U.S. has historically taken a really different approach to nuclear weapons. Their idea has been more about damage limitation. In the event of a nuclear crisis, the U.S. has all of these ICBMs, these intercontinental ballistic missiles that are deployed across these states to be able to hit another country with so much firepower that it will limit the damage coming back to the United States.
So it really sort of comes down to how you think about what nuclear weapons are for, as to whether or not this program is a good idea or whether it’s an unnecessary public expense.

In terms of the downsides of the program, I can see a few. One is clearly the additional construction and cost is absolutely going to affect local folks, local community members, ranchers, farmers, landowners, that sort of thing. And the costs will be borne by Americans all across the country. 
Another thing is that by having ICBMs in these areas, it makes you a target. The point of these ICBMs is they’re there to launch in a crisis and have this damage limitation mission, but they’re also there to be shot at with nuclear weapons. So if you are someone who lives in the state of Wyoming, whether you like it or not, you are a target and you are essentially the first target for a nuclear attack.
That, I think, sort of puts your relationship with, maybe, the military and with the United States government and thinking about what role you have – it raises significant questions as to whether or not that’s the type of role that you want to have in relation to your government. 
I think what’s particularly interesting is that the ICBM force, this land-based missile force, is the only part of the nuclear triad that exists among the American population. The submarines, these are for the most part relatively isolated. There’s two ports. The bomber bases, these are their own enclosed things. 
[But] the silos, you can walk up to them. They’re on people’s land. That’s amazing. They are dotted around the country. People live among them. I think that’s something that people deserve to really think quite critically about and be empowered with the information to assess this for themselves, as to whether or not that’s something that they want.

(Photo courtesy of the city of McCammon)In McCammon, local officials aren’t even sure how old the water pipes are.
But some sections could go back to the 1940s, said City Council President Aaron Hunsaker. 
So, the rural eastern Idaho town started $3 million of work to replace pipes that funnel drinking water from a nearby spring. But at the same time, McCammon is replacing a well, prompting watering restrictions, shutoffs and temporary boil orders in parts of the less than 1,000-population town.
Hunsaker said he hasn’t heard many complaints from the community, who he thinks recognize that the work needs to be done. But he knows it’s been hard. 
“With our water shut off, I think nobody has liked it,” Hunsaker told the Idaho Capital Sun. “Our school has to shut down each time we do it, because of the risk of a boil order.”
McCammon isn’t alone. 
Across Idaho, communities need more than $1 billion to work on infrastructure for wastewater and drinking water this year, a recent study by the University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research found. A small fraction have secured funding.

“This is funding that’s needed to bring systems up to a level where they’re functioning now and going forward,” said Liz Bageant, the lead economist on the study. 
But tackling those needs could get harder, as Congress considers President Donald Trump’s proposal to nearly entirely defund a federal program that funds low-interest grants for local governments to finance water infrastructure projects.
 Infrastructure report card graded Idaho’s water systems at a C+

Idaho’s needs are driven by aging facilities, the state’s fast population growth, and environmental regulations, the U of I study found. But across the U.S., communities have high needs for water infrastructure, Bageant said. 
The issue is especially acute in smaller communities, like McCammon, which have less people to spread the tax burden over. That’s most of Idaho, Bageant said.
Most of Idaho’s water systems are serving small communities, the U of I study found. That means they might need to charge local residents higher fees to pay for one-time projects and maintenance.
“When you have a small number of users, that doesn’t necessarily mean that your upgrade is going to be proportionally cheaper,” Bageant told the Sun. “… And when you do the math for a lot of these small systems, the cost is just too high for your community to bear.”
Earlier this month, the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Idaho section released the state’s latest infrastructure report card, grading Idaho’s infrastructure the same as the nation’s overall: C. That meant the state’s infrastructure was holding up, but is aging and stressed.
The state’s drinking water and wastewater infrastructure systems scored higher, at a C+. 
Idaho’s public water systems provide safe drinking water, but they “face mounting challenges from aging infrastructure, limited funding, and climate pressures,” the report found.
In 2023, more than half of Idaho’s wastewater treatment plants reported violations of the federal Clean Water Act, which were “often tied to aging equipment and capacity issues,” the report found. 
Predictable funding could help both systems, the report said: 

For drinking water, stable access to funds could help. “Long term, predictable access to federal and state infrastructure funding, paired with locally sustainable rate structures, allows utilities to recover full lifecycle costs, reduce deferred maintenance, and invest in needed upgrades while maintaining affordability.”
For wastewater, creating a dedicated state infrastructure fund “could help smaller and rural communities access consistent, matchable funding to replace aging infrastructure and comply with regulatory requirements.”

In McCammon, the city’s ongoing water projects totalled roughly six to seven million million dollars between replacing a well, water lines, and addressing other local water issues, Hunsaker said. The city’s operating budget each year is usually less than $1 million, he said.

The projects are mostly funded by federal loans and grants, and raises to local water rates. 
“It is a challenge for a rural community like our size because a million dollars for a well — it doesn’t matter if we’re a town of 1,000 people or the city of Pocatello,” Hunsaker said. “The cost is still the same. But we have fewer users that we can share that cost with.”
What’s happening in McCammon “is happening in so many towns across Idaho,” said Idaho Rural Water Association CEO Shelley Roberts. 
Wells are going out, and aquifers with dropping water levels are forcing communities to dig deeper wells, she said. 
Because water infrastructure work is expensive, local governments often delay, which can lead to more issues down the road, she said. 
“Projects are becoming more expensive, so then the project even becomes more unaffordable,” Roberts told the Sun. 
 Trump proposed nearly eliminating key federal water infrastructure fund

Water infrastructure projects are largely funded through the federal government, mostly through low-interest loans and occasional smaller grants, Roberts said. 
But Congress is debating cutting a key source of federal funding: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water and Drinking Water revolving funds. In the president’s budget proposal, Trump sought to nearly eliminate the funds, but U.S. House Republicans’ plan in July called to scale back the fund by $662 million, down to $2.1 billion, E&E News reported. 
The final pool of funds was already getting smaller in recent years, as Congress decided to set aside funds for specific communities — a practice called earmarking. 
It isn’t clear how federal funds for water projects might change, said Association of Idaho Cities Executive Director Kelley Packer. 
“We’re very, very nervous that there will be a reduction,” she said. 
The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, which distributes the federal funds for water project loans, didn’t weigh in on how impactful the federal cuts could be.

“Congress is still working through the appropriation process, including determining earmarks, and final levels … have not yet been determined,” agency spokesperson Anna Marron told the Sun in a written statement. 
An earlier draft of the agency’s written responses, shared with the Sun, discussed the proposed cuts at length. 
The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality canceled a scheduled interview with the Sun about changes to federal funding, requesting emailed questions instead. Asked about the change, Marron said “given the technical nature of these topics, and after discussing it with (the agency’s) director and the Governor’s Office, a written response was a better method of communicating our answers.”
 Idaho recently boosted state investments in water. But now, revenues are down.

Historically, the state of Idaho’s main role in funding water projects has been through matches to grants that fund the federal government’s funds for loans, Roberts said. But in recent years, Idaho has invested more — through allocating federal COVID-related funds and state general funds.
In fiscal year 2023, the Legislature appropriated $300 million from funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, which were federal COVID-relief funds, for water infrastructure, Marron said. Then in fiscal year 2024, the Legislature set aside another $23 million from the federal COVID fund and $92 million from the state’s general fund for water projects, she said. 
It isn’t clear how the state would fund water projects next year.
Idaho state agencies told 3% budget cuts will continue into 2027 and beyond

Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s state budget chief last week told state agency directors to permanently extend budget cuts the governor ordered for this year. 
Since Little ordered 3% midyear budget cuts in response to an $80 million projected budget shortfall, the state’s budget outlook improved slightly. 
This month, the Legislative Services Office projected the state was on track to end the current fiscal year next June with a $21.8 million budget surplus, the Sun reported. 
But revenues were still lower than expected, and the budget projection still didn’t account for tax cuts in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement. 
A week before the latest budget projection came out, Packer with the Association of Idaho Cities said until the Legislature meets, the state’s future water investments won’t be clear.
“We hope the state revenues start to trend up, so that there’s more likelihood of them investing,” she said. “And then we will just do our work in trying to continue to educate them on the need and encourage their investments.”

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)BLAIR, Neb. — Tucked away on a hillside in Blair, the Dana College campus sat vacant for the better part of 15 years. But in recent years the property has gained new life through the work of a local nonprofit.
The private Lutheran-affiliated college closed abruptly in the summer of 2010, leaving the staff and roughly 600 students at the time in a lurch. After the land shuffled through several different owners, the property ended up in the hands of Lutheran Family Services, a nonprofit that offers family and health services.

The group has since repurposed two of the college’s aging dormitory buildings — Mickelsen and Blair Hall — into apartments, and some of the units are now occupied by young adults who have aged out of Nebraska’s foster care system. The campus grounds now have a new name: “Dana Village.”
Lutheran Family Services CEO Chris Tonniges said the nonprofit plans to renovate the remaining buildings for other uses over the next few years. Multiple Dana alumni said they are thrilled with the new direction their old campus has taken.
“We have faith now that our shining college on a hill is going to have a strong future,” said Sandra Jensen, who leads the Dana College Alumni & Friends Association.
Small colleges have been closing at an increasing pace throughout the U.S., which can prove detrimental both to the campus population and the communities they’re located in. But in Blair, while Dana College’s closure certainly made a dent, the city has survived.
Dana’s closure
Bob Coffey, president of the still-operating Dana College Foundation and who served on the college’s Board of Regents in 2010, said the regents knew the college was in financial trouble. Specifically, it was in debt to bondholders who intended to seize the campus if they weren’t paid.

Even so, Coffey said the board was hopeful about ways they could keep the college open. He said the group’s main avenue was to shift the college to a for-profit model, but when regents were denied by accreditors, they didn’t have enough money to remain open for another year. The college closed that summer.
The closure was “brutal” to the college’s community, Coffey said, as most were not expecting it, and there was no telling what would come next.
“There’s no blueprint to follow when a college closes,” he said. “People think they will be there forever.”
Many alumni also have strong emotional ties to the campus. Coffey was the second generation in his family to attend Dana College, and started his schooling there 55 years ago. He got tearful recalling the “family” environment that was forged there between the students and their professors.
“They weren’t there to do research,” Coffey said. “They were there to do teaching.”
Dana’s closure also had a major impact on Blair’s business community, as the student population contributed between 300-500 part-time workers each year, according to Mike Rooks, director of Washington County Economic Development.
Blair City Administrator Phil Green called Dana College the “backbone” of Blair’s part-time workforce. The sudden loss of a consistent base of workers made it harder for Blair officials to attract new businesses, Rooks said. Thankfully, several other factors helped the city recover.

One major factor is that Blair is less than a 30-minute drive away from Omaha. Rooks said this offers “the best of both worlds” to residents, who can enjoy Blair’s small-town vibes and the amenities of a larger city.
While Blair serves as a “bedroom community” for many Omaha workers, Green said, there are also plenty of Omaha residents who commute to Blair for work. The city features an industrial park that is one of the largest biorefineries in the Midwest, Rooks said. It hosts multiple companies, including Cargill. Green said the number of workers at the industrial park nearly doubles Blair’s population during the day.
Fifteen years after Dana College closed its doors, Green said Blair has restored its population and workforce back to what it once was. The city’s total population has grown by about 300 people since 2010, and now stands at just under 8,000 residents.
“We’ve been growing, but it just doesn’t look like it,” Green said.
Ownership of the 150-acre hillside campus stayed with the bank for several years. Green said the city had no interest in acquiring the property because of all the associated costs of maintenance.
The land was briefly owned by Midland University, a private college based in Fremont. Green said city officials saw transferring the property to another college as the smoothest option. However, when then-Midland President Ben Sasse left to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, interest in transitioning the campus died out.

Eventually, Dana’s former campus was acquired by Ed Shada and his nonprofit Angels Share. According to Bev Carlson, associate vice president of communications for Lutheran Family Services (LFS), Shada more or less single-handedly organized the refurbishment of what was once the youngest building on Dana’s campus, which opened in 2003, into suite-style housing for people in need. That building reopened for its new purpose in 2021.
Shada had plans to renovate more buildings for housing, but Carlson said he ultimately realized it was more than a one-man job. This was how he got connected with LFS, where he now works on its development team.
What happened next?
After Lutheran Family Services took over the property, it stuck to Shada’s vision to repurpose campus buildings. In early 2024, the group officially opened two former dormitory buildings that now serve as apartments.
Including the building Shada repurposed, the three buildings host 73 housing units, and all but two of those units are occupied, said Stephanie Gardeman, the group’s director of transitional living. Fourteen are occupied by young adults ages 18-25 that have aged out of the foster care system, she said.
Every year, roughly 300 people age out of Nebraska’s foster system after they turn 18, Gardeman said. Many quickly become homeless, she said, if their foster family is unable or unwilling to continue caring for them.

Such was the case for Derek Maxwell, who was in and out of foster care from the age of 4. He was kicked out of his home at 19. Now 25, Maxwell got connected to the Dana Village program while doing research for a college paper on Nebraska’s foster care system.
These residents pay rent, but at a subsidized rate with maximum out-of-pocket costs of $450 a month, Gardeman said. They offer additional rental assistance based on need, and offer case management services that typically last about one-year per resident.
Lutheran Family Services fully furnishes the units with brand new furniture, which the program’s participants can take with them when they move out, Gardeman said. Most residents have had little to call their own for their entire lives — and rarely ever own any new items — so the fully furnished apartments often come as a shock, she said.
Gardeman described older kids within Nebraska’s foster system as a sort of “forgotten population,” as most parents hoping to adopt out of the system are looking for younger children or infants.
Maxwell said most foster kids live without certainty about how long they will be able to stay in a given household. In one of his homes, for example, he said he was kicked out without any warning. It’s the consistency that Dana Village’s housing provided that he said has made the biggest difference in his life.
“I know that I’m safe here and that it’s my home, and I don’t have to move,” Maxwell said.

Those transitioning out of the foster care system often have dealt with limited access to resources for most of their lives, Gardeman said. Maxwell lived with braces for eight years, despite not needing them for more than three.
He got them applied while he was in foster care, but by the time he could get them off he was out of the system and lacked resources to get them removed. A couple weeks ago, Gardeman was able to get him an appointment to have them removed without Maxwell needing to pay.
Aside from some original tile flooring and a few other small features, everything inside the two dormitory buildings has been replaced, Tonniges said. One of the buildings was in such disrepair that the group had space to install an elevator, he said.
In total, the refurbishment of both buildings took about two-and-a-half years to complete and cost about $17 million, Tonniges said. Most of that was donor-funded.

To the uninformed, the apartments appear pretty standard, with shiny new appliances including a washer and dryer in each unit. They’re also compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Carlson said.
Out of the roughly dozen buildings that make up Dana’s campus, less than half are currently operational. In addition to the three buildings for housing, one more building — the Margre Henningson Durham Center — is used by Lutheran Family Services, Dana’s alumni group and Christ Lutheran Church.
The old gymnasium also gets occasional use from sports groups and plays host to annual homecoming celebrations for alumni. Jensen said the homecoming events typically attract between 120-150 attendees.
Signs of the former college remain prevalent across campus, but especially in the gym, where there logos of the college advertising their mascot — the Vikings — can be seen throughout the building.
While the building is in use, Tonniges said no updates have been made since 2010. The gym has working electricity but lacks many other amenities like a working HVAC system.
Signs of age also show in subtler ways. Tonniges said during the winter, the corner walls of the basketball court become see-through because they separate due to the temperature.
Looking to the future
Lutheran Family Services has been working through a 10-year plan for the campus and plans to release a fuller masterplan this year, Tonniges said. The first phase was refurbishing the dorms into apartments, Carlson said.
Most of the remaining buildings were built in the 1950s and 60s, Tonniges said. Because of the college’s abrupt closure, the interiors have been largely untouched and serve as a sort of time capsule back to 2010.
The old library, for example, still has about 50,000 books that were on the shelves when Dana closed its doors, which have been collecting dust.

But the fight to preserve history also combats wear and tear. Most of the unoccupied buildings are currently unsafe for people to enter, Tonniges said, due to concerns about air quality or stability.
On top of that, the nonprofit has been battling vandals who sometimes break in and damage property, along with critters that sneak in and wreak havoc. Tonniges compared the challenge to a game of “whack-a-mole.”
Eventually, Tonniges said LFS would like to reopen all the buildings on campus. His goal is to offer between 400-600 housing units, but he acknowledged that not every building can be repurposed that way.
At this point, Tonniges said LFS has a “big picture” view of what it wants to do with the campus, but the group doesn’t yet have the hard details ironed out. The next phase of the 10-year plan LFS is focused on is fixing the gym.
Carlson said the group plans to continue partnering with the city and other organizations on ideas for how the extra space could be used. She said she hopes they can eventually turn the campus into a destination for the city.
As far as Dana’s alumni are concerned, Jensen and Coffey said they are happy to see their alma mater serving people again. Each observed that though the operation is different, the vision is similar — helping young people prepare for their futures.
“It’s still keeping with the mission,” Coffey said. “It’s just a little bit different direction.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)This is the first of multiple stories published by NC Newsline around the first anniversary of Hurricane Helene, documenting communities recovering in western North Carolina.
FOSCOE — Sherrye Trice pulled up to the store five minutes before it opened, holding a box of diapers with her phone on speaker.
She unlocked the front door, flicked the lights on and made her way back to the storage rooms. After sliding the diapers onto a storage shelf, she began quickly moving bunches of bananas into a new container for the produce section up front.
She froze and covered her mouth when the person on the other end of the phone told her they planned to make a sizable donation, and to match others’ donations for a time.
“You just made my day,” she said, wiping tears from her eyes. After a minute, she hung up the call, took a deep breath and picked up the box of bananas. Shoppers were already waiting outside.
“Good morning, everybody!”

‘A safety net for the high country’
Trice had two volunteers this Wednesday morning.
Luke Barber, a freelance journalist-turned-Appalacian State student, planned to help Trice with everything tech and media. Michelle Daoust, a crisis counselor with the state’s Hope4NC program, comes by weekly to lend a hand.
“You, young man, are going to get to follow me around and chase me today,” Trice said, motioning to Barber. “Because that’s the only way I can get anything done.”
Daoust turned to help the first visitors of the day. They each grabbed a one-gallon white bucket — the store’s version of a shopping cart — and began to walk down the canned goods aisle.
At Foscoe Home Team’s Storm Relief Store, groceries are free. And customers are limited to those living in Ashe, Watauga and Avery counties, all hit by Hurricane Helene. Almost 80 households who are among the store’s frequent shoppers still don’t have reliable running water — still relying on bottles to cook, clean and bathe. “A safety net for the High Country,” is how Trice described the store to the donor on the phone.
Helene hit on Sept. 27, 2024, an unthinkable storm that flooded and buried homes and livelihoods in the mountains. The needs of many are now less a matter of life and death, but for Trice they are no less urgent.
So the store stays open — accepting donations and handing out food, clothes and other basic needs — five days a week. And for the next few hours, a steady parade of cars arrived at the white-sided building in Watauga County, tucked below the Grandfather Mountain.









Trice is constantly dictating text messages to volunteers, friends and neighbors as she dashes around the store. Her iPhone is, it seems, permanently connected to a portable charging bank.

The store is a charity, but there are rules. Verifying your identity and address is non-negotiable. Food and other items have strict limits per person. Each shopper gets one white bucket — and it can’t overflow. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)

Another chilly mountain winter looms in western North Carolina. “When this weather changes, we’re going to be in trouble again,"" Trice said. In the back of the store, two boxes are labeled for adult and children’s gloves. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)







“Nobody is freezing to death,” said Trice. “People have power back. Even if they don’t have drinking water, they’ve got showering water.” But another chilly mountain winter looms. “When this weather changes, we’re going to be in trouble again.” (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
‘I’m the one who lays awake at night when we don’t have enough’
Trice isn’t keen to talk about herself. “I’ll text you the interviews,” she said, dashing off links to a previous radio hit and Facebook video about her and the store.
The short version: She’s an Army veteran whose family has lived in the area for generations. She began collecting donations just days after Helene, at an Avery County community center. Now she has a formal 501(c)(3) for Foscoe Home Team and a two-year lease in the building off N.C. Highway 105, a 15 minute drive from the town of Banner Elk.
She doesn’t take a salary, and donated the amount that would’ve been her pay for the first year back to the nonprofit.
Pen and paper govern the store — workers jot down first-time customers’ info on index cards and verify it with their drivers’ licenses. Trice is “hopeless” with technology, by her own admission. But she’s very familiar with the voice-to-text function, and is constantly dictating text messages to volunteers, friends and neighbors as she dashes around the store. Her iPhone is, it seems, permanently connected to a portable charging bank.
One veteran’s description of Trice running the store: “Not unlike a base commander in a combat operation.”
Wednesdays are usually a bit less busy, and there was a bit of free time between customers. Daoust and Trice took a quick inventory: canned meats are running low, and shampoo and body wash remain big needs. The store doesn’t have any corporate donors, but Trice said they’re “dying” for them: “we’ll take pallets.”
Trice needed to run by Food Lion and the bank. But the errands will have to wait; she doesn’t want to leave the store for too long.
The summer has brought some reprieve. “Nobody is freezing to death,” Trice said. “People have power back. Even if they don’t have drinking water, they’ve got showering water.” But another chilly mountain winter looms. “When this weather changes, we’re going to be in trouble again.” In the back of the store, two boxes are labeled for adult and children’s gloves.
The store is a charity, but there are rules. Verifying your identity and address is non-negotiable. Food and other items have strict limits per person. Each shopper gets one white bucket — and it can’t overflow.
“I do feel bad sometimes,” Daoust said quietly, about the per-person limits.
“It’s not personal,” Trice replied. “I just remember that I’m the one who lays awake at night if we don’t have enough.”
‘They need to be able to talk to somebody’
Zane Tester backed his car up to the front of the store. He waited in the driver’s seat while his dog Sammy impatiently pawed around the back, and a couple plastic bags of essential goods were dropped in the trunk.
Tester was the police chief up in Boone for decades. In the years since, he’s served as a pastor at churches around the area — a “country preacher,” he calls himself.
“It was tough on us, tough on everybody,” he said of Helene. “The little church I pastor, it tore the fellowship hall to pieces. It got the furnace in the big church.”
“A pastor needs to be there. I couldn’t be there.”

Tester is fighting Crohn’s disease. He’s been told time and again to stay home and take care of himself. But dozens of churches in the region still lack regular pastors, he said.
“If we ever needed guidance, a lot of people need it right now,” Tester said. “A lot of people are so discouraged, have so much anxiety, they can’t do nothing. They need to be able to talk to somebody.”
‘I might not have it, but I’ll find a way to try to get it for you’
Jacob Roninger comes by the store most days to pick up the trash and cardboard.
He works just a few minutes away, where he manages the barn and tends to Grandfather Stables. That’s where he was when the flooding began, washing away the fencing and forcing him to bring the horses in.
Roninger spent three weeks after the storm fixing the fences and cleaning. His mother also lives nearby. The small creek by her home had washed out the foundation of three separate buildings.
“I’ve noticed that when it rains now … it don’t take much for it to start flooding,” he said.
Months ago, Roninger saw a sign Trice had posted along the road and pulled into the lot. He’s been a regular since, hauling away garbage bags and folded-up boxes in his truck.
“I do the best that I can,” he said. “I help whoever needs help.”
As he drove around the area after Helene, he recalled seeing mobile homes washed away, leaving some living in tents and others totally homeless.

Marcia Grimes counts herself among the lucky ones. She and her husband stood on top of their 43-year-old mobile home as the water rushed through a year ago, she recalled as she walked back to her car from the store.
Grimes lives in a mobile home community behind a Walmart in Boone. Before the storm, she estimates there were more than 100 homes there. Now there are about 20.
The slanted street their home sits on prevented total loss, but their new SUV suffered some water damage. As she remarked several times: others had it far worse.
“There’s people … who still don’t have anything,” Grimes said. “I’m a people person, I’ll talk to anybody. I might not have it, but I’ll find a way to try to get it to you.”
‘It ain’t junk in there’
Boxes are stuffed like Tetris pieces in the back of the white SUV now sitting in front of the store. One of its four passengers walks in to find Trice, while the others begin unpacking the trunk.
The group of men come from American Legion Post 48 in Hickory, an hour south. They’ve made donation trips to every county in the west since Helene, and multiple trips to most of them.
One of them, John Harden, loaded up his car days after the storm: warm clothes, quilts and blankets, canned goods. His wife died eight years ago, and he had plenty to give that he’d never use himself.
“We had a lot of winter coats that looked like new,” Harden said. “I just cleaned them out.”
The 90-year-old has made dozens of trips around the mountains since, alongside his fellow veterans, though he admits that now he’s “slowed down” a bit.

“A friend of mine is a production manager for Trevor Noah,” Trice said, grinning ear to ear. The box was full of signed copies of the comedian’s memoir. She’d be auctioning them off at the store’s fundraiser in weeks. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)

Wednesday’s boxes were packed with, among other things, winter clothes and candy. “Good stuff,” one of the veterans remarked. “It ain’t junk in there, let me tell you what.”
The delivery didn’t come at the best time for Trice, who was also juggling multiple customers. “Next time guys, please call,” she pleaded. But it was hard for her to be too annoyed as she began to hang flannels and jackets on the clothing racks outside the store.
Harden recalled one trip they made around Easter, with boxes of toys. A boy approached him and asked if he could have the last toy left — a doll.
“I said, ‘you play with dolls?’” he remembered asking the boy. “And he said, ‘no, but I want to give it to my sister.’”
Trice ducked away from the SUV and approached another car, a blue Jeep that just pulled up. After a moment, she walked back into the store holding an Amazon Prime box.
“A friend of mine is a production manager for Trevor Noah,” she said, grinning ear to ear. The box was full of signed copies of the comedian’s memoir. She’d be auctioning them off at the store’s fundraiser in weeks.
‘We’ll be waiting here’
Connie Aldridge starts helping unload the boxes from the American Legion car. She’s a neighbor — the next road over bears her surname — and a veteran, like Trice.
“Just by the grace of God, I met her,” Aldrige said. “And she didn’t stop. I had to get a job to pay my bills, so I went back to work. I stop by randomly, and she puts me to work. She’s good at it.”
She had returned to the region from military service just before Helene struck. She remembered seeing people on the other side of surging rivers and creeks, asking if she could get them food.
They’ve made strides in the year since, despite all the frustrations that remain. And Aldridge is hoping to soon see a steady stream of visitors again — for travelers and outsiders to come re-discover the stretch of the mountains they call home.
“Come see what’s hiding behind that next knoll,” she said. “We’ll be waiting here. Lots of us were taught to suffer, in silence. It doesn’t have to be that way.”

The hefty price tag, highlighted in a newly released report by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth, comes after two consecutive years of corporate tax breaks have squeezed revenues — and as state leaders head into fall budget planning for the next fiscal year.
The federal overhaul is also occurring as hunger levels remain high in Tennessee. More than 700,000 Tennesseans — or one in every 10 state residents – rely on the SNAP program to put food on the table. But a larger portion of the population, more than 1.1 million people in Tennessee, experience hunger, a third of them children, according to Feeding America.
“These are the deepest cuts to SNAP we have ever seen to the program. It will make it harder for Tennesseans to make ends meet, and that hurts our communities and our economy.” said Signe Anderson, senior director of nutrition advocacy for the Tennessee Justice Center.
SNAP provides monthly assistance to people below the poverty line in the form of loaded debit cards to use at the grocery store. The average family on SNAP in Tennessee receives about $340 per month.
Until now the federal government has paid half of the $128 million in administrative costs Tennessee incurs to run the program and picked up the tab for the entire $800 million in cash benefits, according to 2023 data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Under the new Trump administration law, states starting in 2026 will have to pick up 75% of the administrative costs and an escalating percentage of the cash benefit beginning in 2027 — an amount tied to state error rates in processing applications. Paying out too much or too little in SNAP benefits is an error.
Three charts showing the impact of the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ on Tennessee

Tennessee, which had an error rate of just under 10% in the last fiscal year, could be responsible for 10% of the $800 million in cash assistance.
An analysis by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth estimated the cost to the state to preserve benefits only for children could require an additional $110 million in state revenue.
States are required to provide SNAP benefits to anyone who qualifies and the federal government sets the benefit amount, limiting the ability of states to rejigger the program. States squeezed by their new cost-sharing responsibilities could opt to end SNAP benefits entirely, Anderson said.
The state has released no comprehensive analysis of the impact of SNAP changes to Tennessee and the final outlook is complicated by other cuts to the program mandated by the Trump administration.
The new federal law requires states to exclude refugees, asylum seekers and immigrant crime victims from receiving benefits, a number that food advocates said is relatively small in Tennessee. 
The law also expands work requirements. The majority of SNAP recipients in Tennessee are already required to work, receive training or attend school until they are 54 years old, but will now have to work until age 64 to receive SNAP — a change that is expected to disqualify many older recipients. Another shift in work requirements will require parents of children 14 and older to work or go to school; previously the requirement was for parents with kids 16 and up.
Danielle Cotton, a spokesperson for the Department of Human Services, said her agency is currently examining the impact of the federal law and expects to release new details during budget hearings in November.
“We look forward to sharing the specific information with the public at the Department’s public budget hearing with Governor Lee, Commissioner Bryson, Director Thurman, and Chief Gibson,” she said.

(Photo courtesy of Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue)Ron Christensen of Nampa does not think of himself as a hero, although he checks off all the boxes. The same goes for the more than 100 volunteers associated with the nonprofit Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue. 
They are not in it for money or recognition. 
Christensen, 67, is a coordinator for the rescue operation and has spent 12 years either leading or participating in back-country missions. As with other volunteers, holidays are not a given for “peaceful” time with the family.
Boise-based foundation has the backs of our wildland firefighters

“Over the years, I’ve been out during every holiday on the calendar,” he said. “Operations never happen at a convenient time, but when we are sent out on a call, we have an expectation to respond and be at our compound within an hour. That means that people are literally dropping whatever they are doing and going to where they need to be within an hour’s time.”
For no pay. 
And along the way, rescue teams often are navigating extreme weather and fighting through darkness – from the desert in Owyhee County to the terrain of the Sawtooths and Boulder-White Clouds Wilderness.
Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue is not a high-profile operation by any means. Every year, some of the volunteers can be seen selling hot-buttered corn at the Western Idaho State Fair, the organization’s major fund-raising venture. But few people have reason to think much about the group.
Until they are needed, somewhere in the backcountry of Idaho, Oregon and Nevada. And it’s an operation that local sheriffs can’t do without.
Four years ago, the rescue group was a matter of life and death for Connor Bass, who at that time was a student at Boise State University. Bass was snowboarding at Bogus Basin when he went off the course and basically into no-man’s land. The ski patrol had an idea where he went, but couldn’t locate him.
To say the least, it was an eventful time for the rescue team, Connor and his frantic mother (Tara Schaak), who spent the night wondering if her son was alive. The temperature was somewhere around 20 degrees and Connor was not dressed for the occasion.
There is a happy ending to this one. Darryl Beemer, who was part of the rescue team, found Connor and it was all smiles and hugs. Connor was cold, tired and hungry, but otherwise OK.
“All in all, it was pretty straight forward from our standpoint, although it was an unexpected long night for somebody who was out there,” Christensen says. “We’re always glad to see a positive outcome, then we quietly and humbly put away our gear and prepare for the next call.”
Not all calls end up with positive outcomes.
“During the year, we average around 40 missions. Sometimes, an operation ends up being a recovery, and that’s important too,” he says. “There’s satisfaction that comes from this, and parts of it we enjoy. We all like the outdoors, the friendships and the camaraderie and, obviously, we like helping people. You work with a lot of good people and multiple law-enforcement agencies. All have a common goal – to make a difference.”
Ask Tara Schaak about the difference the Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue makes. 
“I write to them every year to thank them for how they changed our lives,” she said.
To her son, Connor, his experience four years ago put him on a career path. Now 25, he’s a firefighter in the small town of Poulsbo, Washington.
“When going into firefighting, I was asked ‘why.’ For me, my ‘why’ is that I’ve been in a situation when I needed emergency services to come to my rescue. They showed up with all the tools, technologies and everything they had to provide that service to me. They also had the level of empathy that will always be with me,” he said.
“I’m the goofball that got lost, but they were not judgmental. Rather, they were like a new set of friends that I found,” he said. “For me, as a firefighter, that is something I will always take with me – understanding what it’s like to need help, then providing that help with empathy and no judgments. So, that’s my ‘why.’ I want to show up for other people when they need it and show up really well.”
That’s what’s called paying it forward.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)As students entered their classrooms at Simle Middle School in Bismarck Wednesday morning, they instinctively went to the back of the room where a wall hanger with numbered pockets was attached to a cupboard door, waiting for their cellphones.
They slipped their phones into one of the numbered slots, one after another, and then took their seats.
No fuss. No comments. Straight into the business of the school day.
North Dakota schools implemented a bell-to-bell cellphone restriction for the 2025-26 school year after state lawmakers passed the ban during the 2025 legislative session with the backing of Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Some schools needed to craft new cellphone policies from scratch, but others, like Simle Middle School, had restricted phones last year, which lessened the impact of the new law, said Randy Lamberth, assistant principal for the middle school.
“Ultimately, what we see is kids have their heads up in the hallway,” Lamberth said.
Last year’s school policy forced kids to have their phones stowed in a locker or backpack, and the change for them this year was turning the phones into faculty at the start of the day and picking them up at the end of the day.
“There’s not a lot of pushback from our kids,” Lamberth said. Disciplinary actions for student phone use have been minimal during the first month of classes, he said.
Gov. Armstrong advocates for eliminating student cellphone use in public schools

Serenity Horne, 14, eighth grader at Simle Middle School, said not much has changed in the cellphone rules between last year and this year.
“It’s been a lot less drama-wise,” Horne said. “There were a lot of kids last year that went to the bathroom to use their phones and now we don’t have that.”
She said she’s noticed the teachers getting more attention from students and she also feels more focused during the school day.
Charlie Reich, 12, seventh grader at Simle Middle School, said he has also noticed students seem to be more focused.
“It feels normal,” Reich said. He added he thinks not having his phone during school hours will help him be a better student.
Bismarck Public Schools Superintendent Jeff Fastnacht said administrators around the district thought the new cellphone policy was going to be a “tough sell” for kids and parents.
“That didn’t materialize the same way that was maybe predicted,” Fastnacht said.
He said only about 50 disciplinary incidents have been reported at Bismarck schools.
“That’s districtwide. That’s 14,000 kids,” Fastnacht said. “That’s miniscule.”
He said the district has seen an increase in medical exemption requests from parents who want their kids to still have access to their phones during the day to monitor medical conditions, and the district is accommodating those requests.
Gov. Armstrong signs bill banning public school student cellphone use in North Dakota

When asked if he believed the law needed to be changed at all during the next legislative session, Fastnacht said lawmakers could clarify what type of medical professionals can authorize a medical exemption for cellphone use.
“Who should be that prescribing doctor that says you need to have access to your phone?” he said. “The law pretty much says it can be whatever they provide us.”
Some schools in the district have rolled a board game and puzzle cart into their lunch rooms to give students more entertainment while they eat and socialize, which used to be a time when students would scroll on their phones, Fastnacht said. 
Audra Zimmerman, principal at Williston Middle School Central Campus, said cellphones were rooted in many of the behavioral problems they were seeing two years ago at the school of about 1,600 students.
“All the fights, and they were recording everything. It was causing a huge disruption,” Zimmerman said. 
To address those problems, the district restricted cellphone use by students last year and required them to check them in with their homeroom teachers at the beginning of the day, she said. If students were caught with devices, they would be warned, and if they were caught again the phones would be turned into the office for a parent to pick up.
With the new state law, the discipline has become more strict and the warnings have been tossed out, Zimmerman said. This year, students caught with their cellphones are immediately met with an in-school suspension, she said.
She said she has also heard criticism from parents this year about teachers being on their phones during the school day. Zimmerman pointed out that teachers need to have their phones because the school uses them to issue emergency alerts.
“If we need a team member to assist a student, if we need a team member to assist another staff member, or there is a medical emergency, it’s all communicated through phones,” she said. 
Williston High School Principal Audrey Larson said teachers are not having to constantly battle students over using their phones. Administrators have taken on a little more of an enforcement role, but they expected that role to increase in the lead-up to the school year.
But, she said the cellphone incidents have been decreasing at the high school as the weeks roll by.
“I think the first few weeks, obviously, we saw a little bit more, but as kids hear that it’s serious, it’s been less and less all the time, so that’s positive because kids are learning,” Larson said. “We’re seeing much less of the Snapchat drama than we used to.”

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)A federally funded program that would have provided $156 million to low-income Tennessee families for solar panel installation has been terminated after several months on hold, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation announced Friday.
The funding was part of the $7 billion Solar for All program, which was designed to create or expand solar programs for about 900,000 low-income households nationwide. Tennessee was one of 49 states selected to receive awards authorized by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Suspending Inflation Reduction Act funding disbursements — particularly spending that involved clean energy initiatives — was one of President Donald Trump’s first actions upon taking office in January. The executive order freezing the funds spurred lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s ability to rescind already-authorized funds.
Tennessee’s Office of Energy Programs was in the process of developing the state’s Solar for All Program guidelines when the Environmental Protection Agency terminated the award in early August, according to the office’s website.
“(The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s Office of Energy Programs) thanks its stakeholders for their interest, time, and significant contributions to Tennessee’s Solar for All proposal and subsequent program design efforts,” the department wrote in Friday’s announcement.

(Jeremy Stevens for Louisiana Illuminator)LAKE CHARLES – Federal regulators have directed a Louisiana casino to sever ties with a former executive who they say failed to alert auditors and potential investors about fraud allegations. The person in question is now a consultant for the casino.  
The National Indian Gaming Commission ordered the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission to suspend the license of Todd Stewart, who was general manager of the Coushatta Casino Resort in Kinder. The federal agency issued the directive in a Sept. 8 letter to the tribe, according to documents the Illuminator has obtained.
Shawna Castellano, a regional director with the National Indian Gaming Commission, wrote in the letter that her agency received a complaint last year that alleged former Coushatta tribal chairman Johnathan Cernek had misused gaming revenues. Those claims were later confirmed through an accounting firm’s audit of the casino, the letter said.

Earlier this month, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor published a report from a separate independent audit that indicated the Coushatta tribe’s leadership did not keep track of credit card use, with no receipts to show for purchases totaling more than $100,000 over a two-month spending period in 2024 that was reviewed. 
Cernek resigned as tribal chairman in August 2024, KPLC-TV reported. Tribal council member Crystal Williams was named acting chairperson after Cernek stepped down, and new tribal chairman David Sickey was sworn in June 13. 
Williams and tribal secretary treasurer Kristian Poncho have not responded to questions from the Illuminator about how financial concerns were reported to them, when they were made aware of potential fraud involving the use of casino credit cards or the quality of information council leadership received from management and auditors during that time. 
Sickey did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and tribe spokeswoman Mary Patricia Wray declined to respond before the deadline for this report. 
According to Castellano’s letter, the commission interviewed Stewart on June 5 and learned he did not “disclose suspected fraud to the external auditors during the [fiscal year] 2023 annual audit of the financial statements.” Stewart also didn’t discuss the matter with “the potential lender of a $150 million construction loan the Coushatta Casino was in the process of obtaining” until the loan was actually secured, the letter said.
The Coushatta Casino Resort broke ground on a new $150 million hotel in March 2024. 
The regulator’s three-page letter, sent to Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission Chairwoman Pam Bass, also alleges Stewart was “unsure of how many credit cards were associated with the Casino bank accounts and uncertain of who was using the Casino credit cards.”
Stewart has not responded to phone calls or emailed questions from the Illuminator about how financial concerns were reported to him, his suspicions of Cernek regarding credit card spending or the scope of his current role as a consultant for the casino.
The National Indian Gaming Council declined to provide additional information about its actions involving the Coushatta tribe.
When the Illuminator reported earlier this month on the audit findings posted on the Legislative Auditor’s website, the tribal council provided a statement through its spokeswoman. It said the council’s credit cards had been eliminated, and the tribe had adopted a formal expense reporting and reimbursement policy.
Hours after the Illuminator published findings from the audit, the report was removed from the Legislative Auditor’s website. Officials said they were discussing whether the state should have posted it on their website in the first place. An attorney with the auditor’s office said federal regulations allow tribes to opt out of having their audit reports made public.
According to the letter from federal regulators, the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission must issue a hearing notice for Stewart’s potential license revocation and notify regulators of its decision within 45 days.
Members of the tribe’s gaming commission could not be reached for comment.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)As we begin our seventh year as a carwash marketing agency in Wisconsin, we’re daily confronted with challenges like scaling, taking on investors and staying competitive in a saturated market. Yet consistently the toughest issue to navigate has been how to approach health care for our employees amid national uncertainty.
Since health care is largely tied to employment, one of our earliest priorities was to make sure that we could be in a position to offer affordable, comprehensive coverage to our employees. And here we are, a few years later, still unable to swing it.
With the current federal administration and the recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, as we go forward, for brevity and so I don’t need to use those words together), our lofty goal of offering the most basic benefits to our employees seems more of a pipe dream than ever. While we wait for the tax breaks that are promised to trickle down from the top earners who benefit most,  we’re facing a very near-term future of funding cuts and even higher daily costs — and in the realm of health care, an uncertain few months of even higher premiums and more difficult access to basic care. Our Republican representatives are still parading the passage of the OBBBA as a win, but when it comes to the reality of the tax breaks and subsidies that are set to expire within the next few months, the silence from our Republican reps is deafening.
The OBBBA does offer tax breaks and incentives, but outside of a few breaks on  large equipment purchases in our industry, neither our customers, who are mostly small, mom and pop operators, nor we will see any benefit. We’re not in a position to fully depreciate the purchase of a private jet. In fact, because of the OBBBA and  the economic instability associated with tariff threats, we’re now facing the potential of our first year of non-growth.
As small business owners in Wisconsin, we’re watching the numbers come out on the OBBBA and realizing just how uneven this deal really is. More than 70% of the tax breaks will go to the wealthiest one-fifth of households, while the middle class gets just 10%. Here in Wisconsin, the top 1% of earners will walk away with average breaks close to $70,000. For families making under $80,000 a year, the break is less than $1,600.
When we weigh the minimal tax breaks we may see against the drastic losses in support, it’s clear this law shifts the burden onto families, state budgets and small businesses already at their limit. Medicaid cuts, in particular, threaten jobs, health care access and community well-being. The OBBBA is hailed as a win, but truly, it undermines our efforts to provide for our employees and community.
On health care, we’re coming up to a harsh deadline — the lapse of premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, an action propagated entirely by Republican lawmakers. With 90% of Americans relying on these subsidies to make coverage affordable, we’re looking at sharp increases in premiums. As a family, we’re already paying nearly $900 per month for non-substantial coverage. This is nearly the cost of our mortgage for coverage that does nothing of the sort — our out-of-pocket payments are ridiculous.
Already, insurance providers are pulling out of key markets in Wisconsin as it is no longer profitable to serve certain areas of the state. How are Wisconsinites supposed to counter this? How do people survive when premiums rise so high, it’s more cost-effective to gamble with one’s health rather than pay rates for coverage that only really serve to prevent complete financial catastrophe after one gets sick?
Ultimately, as small business owners, we can easily see the ripples from the OBBBA and the lapsing of ACA tax credits.

Premiums will continue to rise to untenable levels.
Businesses and individuals will have less money to spend.
Entrepreneurship will stall due to more hesitation to give up benefits in corporate environments.

This legislation does not help small business owners, Wisconsinites, or working families — nor does it promote a healthy local economy. Instead, it burdens those already struggling while directing gains to the top. The damaging effects of these policies will only become more obvious as the new law  unfolds.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)One year after approving Colorado’s first “clean heat plan” to reduce climate pollution in natural gas systems, state utility regulators are weighing the impact of federal clean energy rollbacks on their goals.
Roughly 10% of statewide greenhouse gas emissions comes from gas-burning heating and cooking appliances in Colorado homes and businesses. Under a first-of-its-kind 2021 state law, utilities are required to file clean heat plans outlining their efforts — mostly through investment and customer incentives for technologies like electric heat pumps — to meet emissions reduction targets.
But as the Colorado Public Utilities Commission nears a deadline to set a target for 2035, utility companies and environmental advocates are at odds over how ambitious the state should be in the absence of federal incentives. Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending bill this year fully repealed tax credits for home electrification and energy efficiency upgrades that were passed under President Joe Biden’s administration.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Led by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electricity and natural gas provider, utilities have asked the three-member PUC to target a maximum 2035 cut of 30% below 2015 levels. A coalition of climate and environmental groups want a much more ambitious target of a 55% cut — and so does at least one sponsor of the 2021 clean heat law.
“We need to keep pushing this, because the technology is out there, but we’re seeing such huge changes in our climate right now,” former Democratic state Rep. Tracey Bernett told the commission in a Sept. 18 public hearing. “We’ve got to do something sooner, and reducing (natural gas) is the quickest way we can do it.”










Recovered methane is not going to help. We need to electrify ... We especially need to electrify in communities like mine, where they need to transition first, because we are the most vulnerable.


– Renée Millard Chacon, environmental activist and Commerce City Council member


In a PUC filing last month, Gov. Jared Polis’ administration initially proposed a middle-of-the-road 41% target for 2035. Just weeks later, however, the Colorado Energy Office and the Air Pollution Control Division weakened their proposal in an updated filing, endorsing a 31% target nearly in line with what Xcel had requested.
“What we’ve brought forward in our additional comments, in our mind, is a balance of ambition with potential achievability and cost of that transition,” Keith Hay, the energy office’s managing director for policy, told the PUC.
That target could be revised in the coming years depending on changing market conditions, he added.
“Thirty-one percent represents a real ambition, in our view, for the utilities. At the same time, there’s a lot of concern about that not being ambitious enough,” Hay said. “The commission can set that ambitious target today and come back in the 2030 timeframe, and really look at where we as a state are, where the utilities are at that point in time, and adjust that target upward or downward.”
 ‘Recovered methane’
Colorado has set a statewide goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across all economic sectors by 2050, roughly in line with recommendations from scientists to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.
Another major point of contention in the PUC’s clean heat deliberations is the question of “recovered methane” — natural gas that’s captured by landfills, wastewater treatment plants, livestock operations or other sources and traded through a credit system.
Capturing gas from these sources — sometimes called “renewable” natural gas — is better for the climate than allowing the methane to escape into the atmosphere, but it still releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants when it’s combusted. Climate advocacy groups have sought to limit the application of recovered methane credits in clean heat plans, and state law capped their use at 5% of utilities’ required emissions reductions for 2030.
“Recovered methane is not going to help. We need to electrify,” Renée Millard Chacon, an environmental activist and Commerce City Council member, told the PUC. “We especially need to electrify in communities like mine, where they need to transition first, because we are the most vulnerable.”
But Xcel has asked the PUC to “avoid limiting recovered methane going forward,” and the Polis administration has backed that request, recommending that no cap be set for the 2035 target. That has raised concerns among climate advocates that emissions cuts could be “double counted,” without resulting in real reductions in the gas utility sector.
“If you allow larger amounts of recovered methane to count, then you need to simultaneously increase the stringency for emission reductions from retail gas sales,” said Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development for Boulder-based Western Resource Advocates. “Because otherwise you’re just enabling emission reductions in other sectors, without at the same time driving down emissions from from gas utilities.”
Jack Ihle, Xcel’s regional vice president for regulatory policy, touted the company’s success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in electricity generation, while describing natural gas distribution as “one of the harder-to-decarbonize sectors.”
“It’s hard for us to fathom something that contemplates 600,000 electrification adoptions by 2035, when we have 6,000 or so right now, using a lot of best efforts, in our view,” Ihle said.
“We’re not trying to shirk that obligation,” he added. “I think everyone here is excited to do emissions reductions when we can do them reliably, affordably and achievably.”
State law requires the PUC to enact rules that set a 2035 clean heat target by Dec. 1 of this year. Commissioners said Thursday that they will continue to accept public comments while they consider adopting a rule.

(Courtesy of MECA)OMAHA — A new “economic scorecard” ranks the Omaha metro area, anchored by Nebraska’s largest city, near the bottom of 23 metros nationwide that compete for jobs, talent and investment.
More specifically, the Omaha area placed No. 18 — sixth lowest of 23 peer metros from Boise to Kansas City and Pittsburgh — based on an examination of 50 data points across nine key economic-related categories.

Omaha’s rank is unchanged from last year but has slipped two spots since 2021 in the annual Barometer report produced for the past decade by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce and University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Bureau of Business Research. 
Omaha’s overall score in 2025 is 4% below the national average. Released Monday, this year’s 32-page report led by UNL economist Eric Thompson said the findings shine “a light on uncomfortable truths” that must be confronted with “urgency.”
 ‘Brain drain’ 

The alarm is similar to one sounded in a separate report released this month by the Aksarben Foundation, a more than century-old statewide Nebraska business organization. That research, conducted by Development Counsellors International, showed comparison cities growing jobs five times faster than Omaha. 
 

An Aksarben view
Nebraska’s two largest metro areas, Omaha and Lincoln, have lagged 68,000 jobs behind where both would have been had the markets kept pace the last five years with peers, according to the separate Aksarben Foundation report.
Peer markets for that research included Fayetteville, Arkansas, Huntsville, Alabama and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Those 68,000 occupied jobs would have generated an estimated $11 billion in additional wages, the report said, which could have resulted in $600 million to $800 million in additional tax revenue for the state.

The Lincoln market’s employment and wage growth were nearly identical to Omaha’s, Aksarben leaders said, adding that such “lack of performance” from Nebraska’s two biggest economies represents a potential loss of billions of dollars in wages that could have led to hundreds of millions in tax revenue for the State of Nebraska, which faces a hefty budget shortfall. 
Both reports lament “brain drain,” the exodus of young educated talent from the state. The chamber calls the findings one of the “uncomfortable truths.” Aksarben says brain drain is “far more significant economically than simply an inconvenient truth.”
The chamber report says growth in the number of college graduates ages 25 to 34 is important to workforce strength, yet that population in the Omaha metro from 2019-2023 grew by 1.5%  —  slower than the national growth rate of 6%. By that measure, Omaha scored less than all 23 metros except Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh.
A data-driven effort and survey last year by the chamber and University of Nebraska at Omaha spotlighted some key ways to stop the loss of young talent, including investing in more public transit options, better salaries and flexible scheduling. More than three-quarters of those surveyed described a workplace focus on diversity, equity and inclusion as a “good thing.”
For employment growth, a data point that reflects expansion of private and government job opportunities, the chamber report showed an Omaha growth rate of nearly 1.5% per year from 2021 through 2024 — slower than all its comparison metros except Milwaukee. 
Omaha area survey shows better pay, transit and housing options are keys to curbing ‘brain drain’

“We are not growing our workforce fast enough. We are not retaining enough of our college graduates. We are not adding jobs or raising private sector wages at the pace needed to stay competitive,” the report stated.
Researchers said high taxes and educational attainment gaps are a further drag on the economic outlook of the eight-county Omaha metro area that recently surpassed the million-person mark.
The report noted that sales and income tax rates influence human capital development, as workers will invest more at work and in education if they expect to keep more of the earnings those investments generate. Of the metros the study included, Omaha ranked above only Greenville, S.C., and Buffalo N.Y., for sales and income tax rates, and its position has slipped over the last few years.
“The stark reality is that Greater Omaha must grow faster — faster in employment, faster in wages, faster in residents,” Heath Mello, chamber president and CEO, said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner.
Highs and lows 
Thompson said the latest economic report card also points out “numerous strengths including higher education attainment, labor force participation and the quality of life” in the Omaha area.
In developing the report, his team looked at nine general areas and drilled down into 50 data points. The chamber says the results help gauge how the Omaha area stacks up against other metros jockeying for position in a “race for the future.”
Immigrants help push Omaha metro past 1M population mark as more Nebraska counties grow

Omaha’s progress has been outpaced by high-performing comparison metros, the chamber said. Denver, Nashville, Austin, Salt Lake City and Raleigh have held the highest rankings over the past four years.
Omaha’s highest marks came in areas related to quality of life (ranked 8th), innovation (11th) and entrepreneurship (11th).
Driven by arts and cultural opportunities and quick commute times, Omaha maintained its No. 8 eighth quality of life ranking from last year. Fun fact: Omaha’s average commute is 20.9 minutes, almost six minutes faster than the national average, the report said. 
The report comes as Omaha has tried to spice up its allure, with multimillion dollar developments, including the modern-day streetcar project poised to run from downtown to midtown, the overhaul of downtown parks and amenities as “The RiverFront,” continued growth of the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus and other redevelopment sites across the metro.
Omaha improved its showing in the entrepreneurship category, jumping to No. 11 from last year’s No. 14. On average, the report said, Omaha-area entrepreneurs earn more than those in other metros.

“We are outpacing these metros and the nation at large in GDP growth, keeping down industrial energy costs and demonstrating strong outcomes in unemployment, poverty reduction and closing the gender earnings gap,” the report said.
However, some of Omaha’’s lowest scores showed up in “human capital” — an area researchers described as critical to growth that reflects educational and occupational skills of the workforce. 
Human capital is the area that captures the lag in growth of college graduates and income and sales tax burdens relative to other metros. Omaha placed 20th in the human capital category — a fall from 17th four years ago.
The Omaha chamber, which represents nearly 3,000 member companies, including businesses of all sizes, expects the report to inform employers and policy-makers about where dollars and focus should go.
Moving forward, the Omaha chamber said it plans a focus on three areas: growing and retaining talent, accelerating business growth and positioning the Omaha area “more boldly” on the national stage.
That means investing in “groundbreaking research” to understand why brain drain is happening and how to address why young educated talent is leaving, the chamber said in the report.
Business leaders said they also also want more economic development tools and incentives to compete for new-to-market companies and to help employers expand operations.
“From City Hall to the State Capitol to Washington D.C., economic development and workforce policy must be top of mind for our elected officials,” the report said.
Inclusivity to innovation
Among other score card highlights: For inclusivity, the Omaha area’s score reflects several data points that placed it at No. 13 among the 23 metros. An inclusive economy was described as one in which a broad-section of the population participates in prosperity.
While the Omaha area outperformed the nation for its low poverty rate — the U.S. rate reportedly is 31% higher — the area ranked No. 16 among the 23 metros for the poverty rate gap, indicating that the poverty rate is relatively high for the Omaha area’s non-white and Latino populations. 
Also related to inclusivity, the Omaha area ranked 18th of the 23 metros in its educational attainment gap, indicating that education attainment is comparatively low in Omaha for non-whites and Hispanics.

For innovation, which relates to development of new technologies that can spur high-value entrepreneurial ventures, Omaha has sustained the rank of No. 11 for the past two years. The report said the information technology industry makes up 3.4% of the Omaha area’s economy, higher than the national average of 2.9%.
In the “cost of doing business” category, Omaha climbed from No. 17 last year to No. 15. The report said the Omaha metro consistently has lower business costs due to its lower industrial energy costs and wage rates.
The Omaha area’s average wage rate for occupations examined in the report was 13% below the national average. 
Mello said a community effort is needed to tackle weaknesses and harness strengths.
Said the report: “If this Barometer (report) offers a tough diagnosis, it also points us toward our plan for the future.”

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)Interim North Dakota University System Chancellor Brent Sanford says he would be a good fit to continue leading the higher education system despite not coming from a traditional academic background.
State Board of Higher Education Chair Kevin Black plans to recommend on Tuesday that the board skip a national search and hire the former lieutenant governor to lead the university system long term. 
Sanford said in an interview Sunday he plans to accept the job, if offered. He said his background makes him a strong advocate for higher education and an effective leader to respond to workforce needs.
“As the lieutenant governor, and Doug (Burgum) as the governor, we didn’t have the expertise that all the people who work for the state had,” Sanford said. “You’re the administrator, you’re the manager, you’re the one that’s advocating for them to be able to do their job.”
Sanford has worked as interim chancellor since April after serving as interim Bismarck State College president for nearly a semester. Neither interim post had a public search process.
Higher education board chair favors keeping interim leader of North Dakota colleges

One retired university administrator cautions that hiring a permanent chancellor without a national search and without an advanced degree would be “demoralizing” to faculty and campus administrators. 
“It smacks of political cronyism, frankly,” said Daniel Rice, former dean of the University of North Dakota’s College of Education and Human Development and professor emeritus of educational leadership.
Rice, who criticized the board in a recent letter to the editor, said in an interview he’s sure Sanford is a good person but urged the board to conduct an open and competitive search process and shield higher education from political interference.
Sanford was a business owner and mayor of Watford City during the recent oil boom before serving as lieutenant governor for six years. He went on to work on economic development and workforce issues, including consulting for Bismarck State College. Sanford has a bachelor’s degree and is a certified public accountant. 
Most recent North Dakota chancellors have had a doctorate or other advanced degree. It’s been typical for the board to hire a search consultant, advertise the position nationally and appoint a committee to vet applicants. 
Black told a legislative committee last month he didn’t see a need to conduct a national search because it would likely lead the board back to Sanford.
“I think Brent has really a one-of-a-kind skillset, maybe once-in-a-generation skillset to lead our university system,” Black said in an interview last week.
On Tuesday, Sanford is expected to give a presentation to the eight-member board during its meeting at Minot State University before members decide how to proceed.
Black said national search consultants have often cost $100,000 or more, which he said would be “reckless” to spend if the board members believe they already have their top candidate. Conducting a search internally without a consultant would still require significant staff and board member time, Black said.
“I don’t think the cost of that is worth it when I think we’re ultimately going to come right back to where we started,” Black said.
North Dakota University System chancellor accelerates his retirement to April

Rice called it “penny-wise and pound-foolish” to save money on a search for the top person to lead North Dakota’s 11 public colleges and universities.
“It appears to me to be a way of circumventing the search process because he has a personal candidate that he wants to put into the job,” Rice said. 
It would not be unprecedented for the board to hire a chancellor without a search and without an advanced degree.
Retired Chancellor Larry Isaak did not apply to be chancellor but was appointed to the job in 1994 after a new hire backed out.
“I guess I’m an example of someone who didn’t go through a search,” said Isaak, who had been working in the system office at the time. “And I think we had some success during those 10 years.”
When hired, Isaak was working on a master’s degree, which he said he completed within a year of being named chancellor. Isaak recalled that a group of faculty objected to his lack of a doctorate. Years later, one of those faculty members wrote to him and said he was wrong, Isaak said.
The chancellor position has one foot in academia, Isaak said, and one foot in state government, and it’s important for the chancellor to hire good people with expertise in academic affairs, student affairs and other areas.
Sanford said he understands that some would prefer to see a competitive search, but he also points out that he’s had five months of audition for the job.
Former Chancellor Mark Hagerott initially planned to retire at the end of 2025, but announced in April his intent to step down that month. 
The North Dakota Legislature included language in the higher education budget bill indicating the importance of filling the position “in an efficient and timely manner.” The Legislature also required the board to report by Oct. 15 on the status of the search, including the reasons for any delays.
President openings
The presidencies of Bismarck State College and Lake Region State College are also scheduled to be discussed Tuesday, with a closed-door executive session listed on the agenda. Both campuses are led by interim presidents and the presidency jobs have not been advertised.
Black said last week he favors conducting public searches for campus presidents even as he’s advocating to skip a national search for chancellor. With president searches, it’s important to get feedback from alumni, college foundation, faculty, staff, students and local business community, he said.
“It’s a much different thing to hire a president than it is to hire a chancellor,” Black said. “I have a sense that we’ll want to do a search in those but that’s going to be up to the board to discuss.”
Jensen out Jan. 2 as Bismarck State College president

BSC’s interim president is Dan Leingang, who was vice president of academic affairs and briefly served as acting president. Lake Region State College in Devils Lake is led by Carmen Simone, who had been dean and CEO for Dakota College at Bottineau.
Some board members may want to discuss offering Simone the position permanently without a search, Black said, because she has previously led campuses. Simone is former president of Western Nebraska Community College and was a finalist for the Dickinson State University president search in addition to leading the Bottineau campus.
“She has been really vetted by the board, and so that might play into the board’s decision on whether or not to do a search there,” Black said.
The higher education board approved a separation agreement with former BSC President Doug Jensen last December. Former Lake Region President Doug Darling retired at the end of June.
Chancellor versus commissioner
In addition to debating who will lead the North Dakota University System, board members also are weighing a change in title, largely in response to a push from some lawmakers.
The leader of the system has been called chancellor since the early 1990s, but prior to that the post was called commissioner.
Rep. Steve Swiontek, R-Fargo, raised during the recent legislative session that commissioner is the title in the state constitution.
The higher education budget bill directs the board to study “the costs and benefits of a system of higher education led by a chancellor compared to a commissioner.” The board is expected to discuss Tuesday next steps for the study, including holding listening sessions with stakeholders. A report is due in May.
Lawmakers and current and former higher education officials have varying views on the difference between the two titles.
Bottineau college leader to fill in as Lake Region president

Swiontek said he views a commissioner as empowering more authority to college and university presidents.
Black disagreed that a title change would shift more power to presidents because the authority is outlined in board policies, not a job title.
Black indicated that he favors the commissioner title to align with the state constitution. He added he thinks the chancellor title “invokes a perception of a really authoritarian-type role, and maybe a highly academic role, and that’s not what I think this role is.”
Rice, who as a professor and dean worked under both chancellor and commissioner models, said going back to a commissioner system would “be a step backwards.”
“The commissioner system is much more easily subjected to political wrangling and interference than a chancellor system,” Rice said. 
Isaak, who also worked under both models, said reverting to a commissioner model would weaken the position to more of an administrative role.
“It’s a first step for those who want to undo the system and return to every institution for themselves,” Isaak said.
Black disagreed with that criticism and said the board is committed to a cohesive university system. 
“I just fundamentally disagree that there’s some type of shift toward individualism within the campuses,” Black said.

They’ll sleep on couches, on the floor or doubled up with siblings. 
Former House of Delegates member Steve Westfall decided to do something about it. 
He launched a local chapter of Sleep in Heavenly Peace, a national nonprofit organization that uses volunteers to build and deliver handmade beds along with mattresses, bedding and pillows to children in need. The nonprofit’s slogan says, “No kid sleeps on the floor in our town.”
Since Labor Day, Westfall said they’d delivered nine beds to local kids. 
“An 11-year-old told us this was the first bed she has ever had,” said Westfall, who served as a Republican in the House from 2012 to 2024.
He says they’ll deliver 25 beds to children by the end of the month.
“We know there’s a need. We got two more applications today,” he said Sept. 16.

Westfall said he learned about Sleep in Heavenly Peace from a fellow lawmaker, Sen. Ben Queen, R-Harrison, who had built beds in his home county. 
West Virginia has a rising child poverty rate and a foster care crisis — issues Westfall heard about in the Legislature — that have contributed to children needing beds. Sometimes grandparents suddenly take in multiple grandchildren, and they don’t have enough beds or blankets for the children or the means to pay for it.
Westfall worked with fellow Ripley Rotary Club members to get the local chapter up and running.
In Ripley, not far from Westfall’s insurance agency, there’s now a building full of lumber, table saws, sanders and more. Westfall said that grants and local donations helped it come together. 
Westfall traveled to Salt Lake City to learn how to make the beds from Sleep in Heavenly Peace.
Volunteer groups come in on designated weekends to build and assemble single beds and bunk beds. There’s a dipping tank for a mixture of vinegar and steel wool, where sideboards and headboards are treated to repel bed bugs.  
“Ten year olds could do this,” Westfall said. “We had 8-year-olds on the sanders, and we had 80-year-olds on the sanders.”
Finished beds are stacked in a 20 foot storage building next door donated by the local Constellium plant. 
“The community has really been supportive,” Westfall said.
Sheets, blankets and pillows — all donated items — are sorted in bags and labeled by gender and age to be delivered along with the beds and mattresses.

Families can apply for beds through a link shared on Facebook.
“As long as you live in Jackson County, we’ll approve you, ages 3 to 17,” Westfall said. “We deliver them and set them up.”
Westfall said the biggest need at this time is money to purchase mattresses. He also hopes to see more Sleep in Heavenly Peace chapters open in the state. There are currently four chapters of the nonprofit in West Virginia.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)GILBERT, W.Va. — At a public hearing last Thursday for two proposed natural gas plants in Mingo County, resident Pam Surber had a message for regulators from the state Department of Environmental Protection: “We were here first.”
At 63 years old — and turning 64 in two months — Surber said she’s lived in Gilbert for all but five years of her life. Wearing a shirt with a family photo on it featuring her children and grandchildren, Surber told members of the DEP’s Division of Air Quality that she and her neighbors weren’t willing to sacrifice their health for the emission-heavy development proposed by New York-based TransGas.
“I have a 6-year-old granddaughter here; I don’t want this to affect her life. [The developers] are only putting the dollar before our health and our lives in this area,” Surber said. “This is where we grew up, and I don’t want to live anywhere else. But I don’t want this to come in and make everything worse.”
The public hearing was held for residents to share their thoughts on two air quality permits pending before the DEP. If approved, TransGas would be given the greenlight from the state to construct two new methane- and diesel-burning natural gas power plants. Per the near-identical applications, the plants would operate as “microgrids,” powering two new data centers: one at the Twisted Gun Golf Course in Wharncliffe and another near the Mingo-Logan county line at the Harless Industrial Park, in Holden.
Over almost four hours, dozens of residents from throughout Mingo County came to speak and listen in a room at the Larry Joe Harless Community Center on Thursday. The meeting was sprawling; it kicked off with presentations from Joe Kessler, program manager at DEP’s Division of Air Quality, and Jerry Williams, an engineer with the division, on the permitting process and the proposed project before transitioning into a question-and-answer section for residents and, finally, public comments.
About 15 residents spoke throughout the meeting. More spoke up from the crowd, supporting statements made by their neighbors and criticizing the DEP. Most residents asked questions about the project while also voicing their discontent and concern with the proposals. Only one person in attendance — Ernie Sammons, the owner of the Twisted Gun Golf Course who has said he knows he’ll benefit personally from the development through his land’s sale — spoke in support of the project.
Standing at the podium at the front of the room, Wharncliffe resident Bobby May asked people to raise their hands if they were against the project. Immediately, almost every hand went in the air. Some in attendance raised both their hands.
“I feel that in the southern part of West Virginia, that we are very vulnerable. That’s why [TransGas] decided to tackle this area. We do not deserve [to have them] profit over our lives and our health. We do not,” May said. “You guys [at the DEP] have got the power to put the hammer down. You guys are supposed to protect us. That’s who you’re supposed to make decisions for. You guys know what’s right and what’s wrong. And it’s wrong when you’re inflicting cancer and diseases and death on a community … All this is, is corporate greed. That’s all this is over our lives.”










All this is, is corporate greed. That’s all this is over our lives.

Mingo County residents raise their hands in opposition to the proposed natural gas plants during a meeting on Sept. 18, 2025. The state Department of Environmental Protection is considering two air quality permits for two separate methane- and diesel-fueled power plants to be built in the county. (Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)
According to the nearly identical air quality permit applications filed with the DEP, the two natural gas plants would each house 117 engines powered by methane, with 114 of those running full-time. If no gas is available, the engines would run on diesel that is stored in 40 tanks on each site. 
Annually, per the applications, each facility would have the potential to emit up to 206 tons of carbon monoxide, 194 tons of nitrogen oxides, 118 tons of volatile organic compounds and 188 tons of fine particulate matter, or soot. 
These kinds of emissions are known to negatively affect air quality in surrounding areas and contribute to climate change. People at risk of developing respiratory problems — including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, black lung or other illnesses — are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts from these emissions.
‘We suffer while they profit:’ Residents angry over lack of communication, answers from TransGas and DEP
While the public comment period for the project was extended (it closed at 5 p.m.Friday), the DEP already made a preliminary determination that the air quality permits for the natural gas facilities will be approved. 
Kessler said this is due to the fact that the emissions and plans detailed in the applications meet all federal and state limits. Usually, Kessler said, when that’s the case then the division is “going to issue the permit” no matter other, unrelated concerns.
“[Our job] is to ensure the state is meeting and complying with [state and federal] standards. We’re not the scientists, we’re not the epidemiologists [setting those standards],” Kessler said. “We’re looking at the rules and regulations and writing a permit to stay in compliance with those rules and regulations…”
Throughout the meeting, residents asked question after question that Kessler said was out of the division’s capacity to answer.
They wanted to know how the project will impact their water quality and availability, what kind of noise and light pollution they can expect, how volatile fuel is going to be transported to the sites and what would happen if anything went wrong at the facilities, among other things.
Over and over, Kessler informed them that the division didn’t have answers. Questions about water, he said, could be answered under a separate permitting process through the DEP’s water division.
Other concerns, however, will likely remain unknown as the state has implemented a law that stops localities from enforcing any statutes — like noise, light or zoning ordinances — against microgrids built to power data centers. All but 30% of the taxes collected where the developments are located would be diverted to the state. Meanwhile, residents will bear 100% of the environmental and health impacts they bring.
Tonya Mounts, an attorney and Gilbert resident, asked Kessler and the other regulators, including Division of Air Quality Director Laura Crowder, what residents would need to do to stop the state from approving these applications and allowing the developments to move forward.
“Submit relevant comments pertaining to the air quality,” Kessler said. “But I’m going to be 100% honest with you — our rules don’t allow us to deny a permit for 500, for 1,000 people standing up and saying they don’t want [a project].”
Mounts asked the regulators if they would feel comfortable living within a mile of these plants and their emissions.
Kessler said he lives within a mile of the DOW Chemical plant in Kanawha County. He said he would “not be afraid” of the air quality. 
Crowder said she lives in St. Albans, within a few miles from the John E. Amos Power Plant.
“So yes, I would live there,” Crowder said. “I raised my son there.”
In the front row, Surber shot to her feet.
“But you choose to live there; we didn’t choose this,” she said. “We were here first.”
In the crowd, her neighbors shouted “Amen,” and “Give it to ‘em, Pam.”

When it was her turn to address regulators directly, Surber scanned the crowd looking for one man: Adam Victor, the president and founder of TransGas.
She asked him to stand, or at least raise his hand, if he was in attendance. He was not.
“Everybody look around this room,” Surber said. “He’s not here. He’s never here.”
Surber asked regulators why they trusted Victor to adequately and safely run two large power plants if he can’t even show his face to the residents his project would affect. Kessler said that, if anything did go wrong, Victor and TransGas would be fined.
“Well you can fine him. I would just like to F-I-N-D him,” Surber said. “I don’t trust him. We don’t know anything about what this will do to our community. Everything has been kept hush-hush about this … [TransGas] doesn’t want us to know.”
Demone Morgan asked if the regulators were willing to be held accountable if this project didn’t go as planned. What would they do, he asked, if people were hurt by the emissions that would come from the development or any of the other potential consequences it could bring for their community. Kessler said that if the plants operated out of compliance, there would be fines.
“We’ve been promised a lot of fancy things here,” Morgan said. “They promise us a bag of stars, then they give us a bag of crap.”

For decades, the state’s southern coalfields have been struggling economically and otherwise. 
Once flourishing, the decline of the coal industry over the last several decades has led to few employment opportunities and little economic growth or development. 
And as the economy has shrunk, people’s health has simultaneously suffered. The ramifications from generations of active coal mining, and later fracking, include contaminated water supplies and environmental health hazards for those who live there.
Throughout the coalfields, water systems are crumbling. Broadband infrastructure is lacking. Health care and food deserts persist. Developments that bring steady, safe jobs are few and far between.
And yet, Morgan said, promises are always made from those in power or those looking to benefit from the land or its people that they have a solution to turn things around.
Morgan said he’s heard these promises almost his entire life. The people making them, he said, will downplay the risks, telling residents that everything will be fine and that if they just wait, the promises will come to fruition.
“Well, I’ve never seen these promises come true,” Morgan said after Thursday’s meeting. “Not for internet. Not for water. Not for jobs. Not for nothing. Why would this be any different? They don’t care how we suffer while they profit.”

The scene in the Oval Office, rather than showing courage and independence of thought, idid not instill much confidence in good and wise government. Lee always likes to exude control and the appearance of firmness. But both he and Trump seemed a little clueless about what the other would be saying on that morning.
Had they actually discussed how the National Guard is to be deployed? With what directives and clear rules of engagement? Who will be the commander of this multi-agency state-federal force?
And what is the truth about crime in Memphis?
Trump deploys National Guard troops to Memphis for anti-crime task force

Crime statistics maintained over years by Memphis Police Department and the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission show a noticeable decline in the most important numbers for major violent crime. The commission’s report for the second quarter of this year showed a 17.4% drop in violent crime, and a 22% decline in major property crime. And while some local Republican lawmakers are questioning the numbers, there is no reason to believe MPD or the Crime Commission is fudging the numbers.
 Beyond the numbers, what we need most is collaboration, which is not a foreign concept. We have had it before. In the summer of 1979, some six months after taking office, then-Gov. Lamar Alexander created the Greater Memphis Community Governor’s Economic and Jobs Conference. In doing so, Alexander fulfilled a campaign promise to make economic development and an improved quality of life in Memphis a top priority.
The Jobs Conference, as it became known, attracted some 200 racially diverse participants in task forces to specifically address business recruitment, energy needs, public transportation, poverty and education. The initiative also included a task force to improve the city’s image and a nonstarter effort involving local tax reform.
It may not look like it now, but the Jobs Conference had a positive impact on Greater Memphis. For a time, the city did make headway in economic development and helping small and Black-own businesses succeed. But mostly, Alexander’s signature effort for Memphis succeeded in building consensus and collaboration between local leaders and residents and state government that stretched well beyond political partisanship.
 “The most important thing I can do is help raise average family income in Tennessee,” Alexander told The Commercial Appeal in November 1979, on the eve of a massive two-day Jobs Conference gathering. “One in five Tennesseans lives in Shelby County, so more and better jobs there will help raise incomes more than any other activity.”
Alexander was just the second Republican elected governor in Tennessee since 1910. After his election in 1978, the office alternated between Democrats and Republicans largely because all of them governed mostly from the middle and sought to build consensus wherever possible.
It’s unfortunate that these days, Lee is running his administration as a conservative bastion beholden to the political whims of Trump and his senatorial enablers, Blackburn and Hagerty.
Lee has shown time and again where his loyalties lie, and he has shown little interest in collaborating with city and county government leaders. The decision to saturate Memphis with the National Guard is a prime example.
Tennessee governor not ready to deploy troops to Memphis

The governor said in late August that he had no plans to deploy National Guard troops to the Bluff City, citing a reduction in crime over the past year. That obviously rankled the president who has been looking for a blue city in a red state to plant his politically driven tough-on-crime flag.
The following week, Lee backtracked by telling reporters anything is possible on the issue of sending in the troops. Then came last week when the president abruptly announced on Fox News that he is sending the National Guard to Memphis. By then, Lee’s 180-degree turn was complete.
And on Monday at the White House, Lee told Trump and a national TV audience he welcomes the increased federal intervention in Memphis. “I’ve been in office seven years. I’m tired of crime holding the great city of Memphis back,” he said. Lee then said he had spoken earlier that day with the directors of the U.S. Marshal Service, the FBI and with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whose first name Lee misstated.  
But he had not spoken to any degree with local officials, including Mayor Paul Young, who so much as said he was blindsided by the announcement. Plus, Lee never mentions the numerous state gun laws he has signed that have put more weapons on our streets and have been a catalyst for much of our violent crime.
Despite the recent drop, the crime problem in Memphis is real and well known. It’s been a drag on the city for years, even decades. In recent years, the homicide numbers skyrocketed — particularly during the pandemic — before starting to fall over the past two years.
Unfortunately, Memphis has allowed itself to be defined almost solely as an out-of-control, crime-infested city when that narrative is grossly overstated.
And now that the National Guard’s presence appears to be a certainty, what we need is collaboration to determine the best use of those additional resources. Lee deserves credit for significantly increasing the number of state troopers patrolling Memphis from about a dozen to 150. He told WMC-TV anchor Joe Birch on Sept. 16, that the National Guard personnel coming to Memphis will be trained military police officers.
“The way we attack crime in Memphis is about to change and it’s about to change forever,” Lee said.
That can be a positive step if the people involved at the federal, state and local level work collaboratively to make a tangible difference in reducing crime – the same way Lamar Alexander worked nearly half a century ago to improve the economic fortunes of Memphis.
Obviously, we are about to see a historic time of testing for Memphis and for Tennessee’s elected leadership.
We will need all the parties involved now to show proper restraint, good policing and a high level of coordination in exercising the powers of the federal government that are being concentrated here.
Let us all pray for a positive outcome for Memphis and its people.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — Planned Parenthood’s leadership has “no plans” to close its two Kentucky locations following a judge’s ruling that the government can block Medicaid funding to the organization for a year. 
Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood’s largest geographic affiliate of health centers that includes Kentucky, told the Lantern Thursday during a sit-down interview in Louisville that the state’s two locations — in Lexington and Louisville — will keep their doors open for now. 
The two centers, which see thousands of Kentuckians every year, will continue offering routine services like mammograms, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing, prenatal and postpartum care and more. 
Congress passed a sweeping budget law over the summer that, among other things, banned Medicaid payments to  clinics and providers that offer abortions even for other health care, such as cancer screenings, and family planning services they provide. A judge blocked the ban briefly, but a U.S. Court of Appeals overruled that decision on Sept. 11.

Planned Parenthood leadership, Gibron said, has been preparing for such news since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, removing the constitutional right to abortion and handing states power to create a patchwork of laws. Kentucky immediately banned abortion in most cases. Since then, all lawsuits and bills filed in challenge of the law have failed. 
“What we have been doing, frankly, ever since the fall of Roe, is contingency planning around these scenarios,” Gibron said while visiting the Louisville Health Center last week. “We anticipated a lot of what is happening.” 
For now, she said, Kentucky Medicaid patients will continue to be served for free through September. Slightly more than half (51%) of Kentucky’s Planned Parenthood patients fall below the poverty line and 36% have Medicaid, according to the organization. 
“Our No. 1  priority is protecting our patients’ access to care, so we are doing everything that we can right now to identify the path forward of how we do that,” Gibron said. 
She is turning to donors, hoping to raise funds to fill the gaps, she said. Patients “may have to pay something in the future; that is yet to be determined what that may be,” she said. 
Meanwhile, she believes that “there is no way” the funding blocks will last only one year. 
“Absolutely, we are going to have to raise more money to mitigate that impact of the Medicaid defund,” Gibron said. “We are resilient and resolved. I am fiercely committed to our work and to our patients.” 
‘Lives are at stake.’ 
Jennifer Allen, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates and a policy expert with the organization, told the Kentucky Lantern that funding cuts will have far-reaching fallout, worsening maternal health, birth outcomes, maternity care deserts and more in a state already plagued by barriers to care and poor outcomes.

“Medicaid was created because we had a shared belief in this country that everybody should have coverage for some basic level of health care, including reproductive health care, and we seem to have lost that,” Allen said. “We know that Medicaid never guaranteed access. It only guaranteed at least a minimal level of coverage for folks who could least afford any access to health care.” 
About 1 in 3 Kentuckians are covered by Medicaid, a federal-state program that also saw cuts in the budget bill passed by Congress this year. 
People who have Medicaid coverage, Allen said, “are the folks who already have the worst health outcomes; already may be the sickest, and that’s just going to get worse.” 
The Kentucky General Assembly, she said, needs to “find a way to assure that patients will still have access to care without cost for the lowest income.” 
“We’ve got to figure out how to assure that we have a basic level of expectation of health as a part of basic human rights, as a part of human decency,” Allen said. “Being able to take care of yourself and your family, take care of your body, should be a basic value for all of us. That’s what we need to see. So, donors are wonderful. We love them. We’re so grateful to them, and they care, like we do, about making sure that patients can come in still and get access to care. But it shouldn’t have to be that way.” 
During the interim between legislative sessions, Kentucky lawmakers  have heard several presentations about federal changes to the Medicaid program and details about the budget bill, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. During the 2026 legislative session lawmakers will be tasked with passing a new two-year state budget, which would need to account for funding shifts set in motion by that law. 
Rachel Brown, the area services director for Planned Parenthood who works in Kentucky and other states, said she’s already looking for ways to cut costs and streamline care. Kentucky’s centers see 4,861 patients every year, according to Planned Parenthood data, and more than 8,000 visit the two facilities annually. 
“We don’t know what patients will do when they lose the ability to use their Medicaid here,” Brown said. “I think that patients will still want to come here if they can. The other thing is: There aren’t places to go. The idea that: ‘Take away people’s ability to come to Planned Parenthood and they’ll just go somewhere else’ is a farce. That is not a real thing.” 
Kentucky has had a well-documented health care workforce shortage for years. Researchers have estimated Kentucky could lose 35 hospitals in the funding fallout from the federal budget bill. 
For now: “I want to say really definitively: We have no plans to close our Louisville or Lexington health centers,” Gibron said. “Can I sit here and tell you that will be the case for the next three years of the Trump administration? I honestly don’t know yet, but I’m going to do everything I can to prevent it, because patients’ lives are at stake, and my plan is to not abandon our patients in the way that lawmakers have.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and now Memphis, Tennessee, have been subject to President Donald Trump’s orders deploying National Guard troops to their streets.
Until his announcement last Monday that he’d send in troops and federal law enforcement agents to Memphis with the support of that state’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee, Trump’s focus had been on Democratic strongholds. 
The White House shelved plans to send the guard to Chicago over the objections of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, after advisors warned it would draw legal challenges. But that didn’t end speculation that other large Democratic-run cities, such as Philadelphia, could be in line for what Trump calls an effort to “restore law and order.”  
“It’s very important because of the crime that’s going on, not only in Memphis, in many cities,” Trump said in the Oval Office when he signed an order to send forces to Tennessee.
Gov. Josh Shapiro and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, both Democrats, have said they plan to fight back with the tools their respective offices provide if the president turns his attention to the commonwealth. 
“It is my hope that it will not get to that here in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro told reporters Wednesday. “I can tell you that we are preparing aggressively on that front.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Krasner said in a series of town hall meetings around the city that he would prosecute federal officials for civil rights violations and encouraged Philadelphians to record any incidents they witness.
The National Guard is unlike other military services in the United States. It exists under dual sovereignty, meaning it is commanded both by the president and the governors of the states where National Guard units are based.
Governors have the authority to deploy their states’ National Guard on missions anywhere in the country for disaster relief, as Shapiro did last winter when heavy snow stranded people in Erie. Guard units under state control can also support civil law enforcement, as in the National Guard’s ongoing mission at the United States-Mexico border.
“I’ve deployed our Guard to the southern border of the United States. I’ve deployed our guard to Germany, where they’ve trained Ukrainian soldiers in trying to push back on Russian aggression,” Shapiro said. 
In that context, the National Guard is functionally a state militia, according to Beau Tremitiere, an attorney with Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to preserving America’s form of government. 
National Guard troops can also be deployed with a governor’s consent under Title 32 of the United States Code, to carry out a federal government mission as in Tennessee.
Without a state governor’s cooperation, the president can federalize National Guard troops under Title 10, which governs the Armed Forces, but their missions are limited to repelling an invasion, putting down rebellion and enforcing federal law.
“I think that it is dangerous when a commander in chief of the United States tries to usurp the power from the commander in chief of the state, it sets up a conflict,” Shapiro added. “And we’ve seen that conflict play out on the streets of Los Angeles as just an example. We are prepared, should the president of the United States seek to try and commandeer our guard and deploy them on the streets of Philadelphia or anywhere in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

National Guard soldiers have been used to enforce federal laws in the past – notably when Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy used troops to enforce desegregation laws. But Lindsay Cohn, a political scientist who studies civilian-military relations, said it is a seldom-exercised power of the presidency. 
“That means there’s very little jurisprudence around it,” Cohn said. “There isn’t really a clear legal path to sending troops into other states for state-level law enforcement.”
If the Trump administration were to call on Republican governors to send guard soldiers to cities like Chicago or Philadelphia, it would be on a highly-dubious legal footing and would violate core constitutional principles, Tremitiere said.
“One state cannot lawfully invade another,” Tremitiere said. “There might be cases when the president could lawfully federalize the guard, even though it’s a bad and dangerous idea. It’s critically different when you’re talking about one state sending forces into another state and actively policing its streets. That’s never OK.”
The Posse Comitatus Act, which stems from the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, forbids federal troops from enforcing state or local laws.
“For the first time in peacetime, in U.S. history, you had a lot of federal personnel, military personnel, being used to try and just manage civilian affairs,” Tremitiere said, adding Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878 to reinforce the nation’s founding principle that military involvement in civilian government is an inherent threat to liberty.
Under the Insurrection Act, however, the president can temporarily suspend the act. The law’s intent is to allow the federal government to address internal rebellion using the regular Army and National Guard. But critics warn that it’s too vague and leaves too many details to the president’s discretion. 
While the Trump administration has reportedly considered using the Insurrection Act, it’s considered an extraordinary measure, Tremitiere said.
“It’s long been recognized as a red line,” he said. “Either facts on the ground are so awful that we have to resort to this extraordinary remedy, or if the glass is broken short of an actual rebellion, it means that there is a clear abuse of power.”

Trump employed Title 10 to federalize California National Guard troops over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objection in response to protests over immigration raids in June. A federal judge in San Francisco ruled earlier this month that the deployment was illegal. 
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the civilian police force was able to enforce the law and the use of armed troops to conduct traffic blockades and crowd control violated the Posse Comitatus Act. 
Taken with Trump’s and Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth’s statements they intend to send National Guard troops into other cities, it raises concern the administration was “creating a national police force with the president as its chief,” Breyer’s decision said. The administration is appealing.
In the District of Columbia, Trump initially mobilized the district’s own National Guard in August to respond to what he characterized as a city “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals,” notwithstanding federal Justice Department data showing crime in the city is at a 30-year low. 
Six Republican governors have since agreed to use their Title 32 authority to send their National Guard soldiers to the nation’s capital. Because those troops are technically under state control, the Posse Comitatus Act doesn’t restrict them from law enforcement duties.
In a challenge to Trump’s actions, D.C. leaders have argued the deployment violates the autonomy Congress vested in the city to police itself and determine when to request National Guard aid from other states. They also allege it violates the Posse Comitatus Act because the district’s National Guard reports directly to the president and is always under federal control.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has credited the presence of federal law enforcement — including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI — and their partnership with the Metropolitan Police Department with lowering crime in the city.

At the same time she said the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and National Guard troops “is not working,” citing a break in trust between police and the community. “We know having masked ICE agents in the community has not worked, and National Guards from other states has not been an efficient use of those resources,” she said.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has endorsed Trump’s suggestion to use the national guard to combat crime in New Orleans, although he has not asked Trump to do it or used his own authority to mobilize the state’s guard.
If the Trump administration were to employ the same tactic in states with Democratic governors, like Pennsylvania, they would have a right to challenge it directly in the U.S. Supreme Court, Jane Bentrott, also an attorney with the Protect Democracy Project, said.
But Tremitiere said Illinois Governor Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Johnson were effective by standing firmly by their convictions that sending troops is unnecessary, unlawful and would not be tolerated.
“Their courage created a real political cost,” Tremitiere said. “All signs suggest their bold stance led to the administration backing down on what appeared to be a pretty clear intention to move forward promptly in Chicago.”
Bentrott said Shapiro has shown similar resolve without picking a fight with Trump.
“So far that seems to be working,” she said. “Not drawing fire while still holding firm that he would oppose the National Guard coming in here.”
More conventional political forces may also shape the Trump administration’s plans as the midterm elections draw closer, Cohn, the political scientist, said. 
“The evidence that we have indicates that the public is not extremely comfortable with militarized law enforcement,” she said. “That is something that at least some of his advisors are going to take into account and worry about.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metroguard-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

Gavin Newsom blasted President Donald Trump for his “relentless, unhinged California obsession” in a Sept. 9 State of the State address.
Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker likened federal immigration enforcement practices to Nazi Germany.
Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Trump’s threats of immigration raids in Boston a “power grab” and “political theater.”
Here’s Gov. Dan McKee’s sharpest language toward the White House so far: “At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption.”
The governor’s statement came the day after the Trump administration sent shockwaves across Rhode Island by issuing a stop work order on the Revolution Wind project, already 80% complete and set to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut late next year.
It’s the same measured tone he’s used throughout his four and a half years as governor. A Cumberland mayor before he was elected lieutenant governor in 2014, ascending to the governor’s office in 2021, McKee, 74, has built his brand around “teamwork” — an homage to his time as a youth basketball coach — that features cooperation with municipal and business leaders, some of whom might not identify as Democrats.
Facing low polling numbers  — he’s at the bottom of the heap among state governors —  McKee is now being cast as too weak, too slow and too deferential to Trump by opinion writers, social media spectators and his potential rivals in the 2026 gubernatorial primary. Do their claims have merit?
Not necessarily, said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist and director of the Taubman Institute for American Politics and Policy at Brown University. While McKee’s critics see his lack of verbal attacks against the Trump administration as a sign of weakness, Schiller views it as a strategic move.
“We have a very big bridge to fix,” Schiller said, referring to the demolition and rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge, which relies on millions of dollars in federal funding. “I think he was worried about putting that money at risk, and in some ways, rightly so, because Trump has shown he goes after people who criticize him.”
Avoiding bombastic language could help keep Rhode Island off Trump’s radar, in turn preserving the critical bridge funding along with other federal support, Schiller said.
“He took the cautious route,” Schiller said of McKee. “I am not sure that he should be criticized for that.”
McKee doesn’t see his approach as cautious at all, though.
“I speak out against Trump all the time,” the governor said in an interview. “My actions show that.”

Actions not words 
McKee points to his comments about slashed federal education funding and the halt to the Revolution Wind project as examples of his verbal condemnation of Trump’s policies. 
More important to McKee are his actions, like ensuring Rhode Island residents of all ages can receive COVID-19 boosters, with insurance coverage, despite more restrictive federal guidelines and educating Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on exactly how much progress Revolution Wind has already achieved. McKee pointed out that his office organized the Monday morning press conference at Quonset Point — less than 72 hours after the Revolution Wind project was put on hold — bringing together labor leaders, Rhode Island’s congressional delegation and local workers to put the spotlight on the economic consequences of Trump’s actions.
“I’ve made it very clear to everybody that wants to listen, this is a very direct hit on our economy, a direct hit on people’s pocketbooks,” McKee said. “I consider that strong language.”
McKee insisted he heard “no difference” between his responses to the federal administration and the words used by Newsom, Healey and Pritzker.










I speak out against Trump all the time. My actions show that.


– Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee


But it’s not fair to compare McKee to more outspoken Democratic governors. Some states have more to lose under federal actions, and some leaders have more to gain by publicly bashing Trump, said Adam Myers, an associate professor at political science at Providence College.
“Rhode Island is a very small state,” Myers said. “McKee doesn’t have the same political platform that some of these other governors do. And my sense is that he doesn’t have national political aspirations.”
Myers observed McKee turning up the temperature “a little bit” after work on the Revolution Wind stopped, which makes sense given the stakes for state jobs, energy prices and environmental mandates.
“This is something that has major economic ramifications and energy ramifications for Rhode Island,” Myers said. “It’s not just a garden variety culture war.”
Versus, for example, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s written warning to McKee to reverse the state’s “sanctuary” immigration policies. McKee never responded to Bondi’s letter.
“It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to alienate the Trump administration at this point,” Myers said. “The ball is in the federal administration’s court. Exactly what leverage does Rhode Island have?”
Yet trying to keep a vindictive national leader happy might sour some Rhode Island voters on McKee in next year’s gubernatorial race, especially if they have the choice of a candidate with more vocal denouncement of Trump.
An eye on 2026
Public polling suggests six in 10 Rhode Island voters don’t approve of Trump or his administration’s actions; nearly two-thirds of 2024 voters think the country is facing a constitutional crisis, including 27% of Republicans, according to a June survey from the Pell Center at Salve Regina University.
“Democrats are hungry to make a statement to do something, because they’re so distressed about Trump,” Schiller said. “There’s no question, Trump will be the No. 1 issue in the 2026 elections, along with the economy.”
McKee’s known and potential election rivals are already trying to distinguish themselves as more ready and able to take on Trump.

Helena Buonnano Foulkes, 61, who became the second official candidate to declare her intent to run in the 2026 gubernatorial primary, took clear aim at Trump in her campaign kickoff speech.
“Here’s my message to Donald Trump: We will not tolerate your reckless agenda,” said Foulkes, eliciting the loudest, most raucous set of audience cheers of the Sept. 9 event.
In a one-on-one interview the same day, Foulkes criticized McKee’s public stance — or lack of — on federal actions.
“When I look at the Democratic governors, I don’t think Gov. Dan McKee has been at all on the front lines,” Foulkes said. “My biggest criticism is that he is not planning ahead for Rhode Islanders.”










It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to alienate the Trump administration at this point.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who is term-limited, has not confirmed his intent to challenge McKee in the September gubernatorial primary. But he hasn’t ruled it out either.

Neronha, 61, used his platform as the state’s top prosecutor to go hard against Trump, in the courts — part of 34 multi-state lawsuits as of Sept. 4 — and in the public eye.
Despite Schiller’s suggestion that the president might punish those who attack him, Neronha said he has never hesitated or held back — in legal complaints, or verbal rebukes.
“I think you have to stand up to bullies,” Neronha said. 
Already at odds with McKee for years for a series of perceived offenses by both sides, Neronha called McKee’s response to the Trump administration “a little anemic.” 
“The governor may think, you don’t want to poke the bear, but the bear is coming for you,” Neronha said. “You can’t reason with a bear that’s as hungry as Donald Trump.”
McKee brushed off the criticisms by Foulkes and Neronha as “politics as usual.”
“You’ve got a candidate and a potential candidate for my job,” he said.  “I am not surprised.”
That answer might not fly with voters as the campaign heats up. 
“Someone like Foulkes who is not in office has the advantage of riding the wave,” Schiller said. “If McKee was smart, he’ll match her energy as much as he can.”
Labor love 
And while McKee struggles to climb out from persistently low approval ratings — 25% to 29% of voters think he’s doing a good job, according to recent polls — he’s still got the backing of one of the most important influential groups in Rhode Island politics: labor. Union organizers, including Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley, stood shoulder to shoulder with McKee during the Aug. 25 press conference at Quonset Point to address the labor impact of the Revolution Wind project.
“I think he came out pretty vociferously on the offshore wind stuff,” Crowley said of McKee. “I didn’t see any lack of vigor.”
The AFL-CIO endorsed McKee in the four-way 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary, which also featured Foulkes. The organization has not decided who it will support in the 2026 gubernatorial race — it’s too early, Crowley said. 
Labor organizers are looking closely at the fate of Rhode Island’s only major offshore wind project — and who leads the charge.
“Officials at nearly every level of government are saying the right things, but the real question is, ‘what do we do next?” Crowley said. “We just want the jobs back, and we want the project back up and running.”

The line will run 8.5 miles from northern Jackson County through southern Madison County. (Photo by Whitney McKnight/The Edge)RICHMOND — A judge has granted a protective order to an electric utility that sought to prevent the public from seeing a trove of documents requested for review by Berea College. 
Madison Circuit Judge Kristin Clouse heard arguments from the two sides last week before deciding that the Winchester-based East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC) should have the right to protect information about the locations of certain substations and transmission lines, their capacities, the annual load on the substation currently serving the Big Hill region, and other details about how the substation fits into the power grid. 
Clouse did not grant protection for other questions such as what steps the utility is taking to protect the view shed at the college’s Windswept property and whether and when there will be an environmental assessment pursuant to federal law.
The documents had been requested by the college in a discovery motion as the two entities battle over whether EKPC has the right to take about a mile of the college’s forest land to build the 8.5 mile long transmission line. The power co-op  filed a condemnation suit against the college earlier this year.
The college fears that the line will mar the Pinnacles’ viewshed, among other concerns. The Pinnacles is a popular destination for hikers who can traverse a network of trails in the Berea College Forest. 
The college’s legal team has said the ultimate goal is for EKPC to demonstrate conclusively that the transmission line is necessary. The 69 kilovolt Big Hill Line does not meet the state Public Service Commission’s threshold of 138 kilovolts for EKPC to be required to file for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the PSC.
The utility has maintained throughout that the line is necessary to provide reliable power service to the electric co-op members in the region. 
The judge today also granted permission to Ryan Turner, the lawyer for multiple other parties who own property that will be impacted by the transmission line’s construction, to file a motion that the utility must prove it has demonstrated need before it can claim right of way to his clients’ respective properties. The motion will be held in abeyance until after a ruling comes down in the case between the college and EKPC. 
Clouse instructed EKPC to redraft its motion for a protective order to reflect the pared down number of items she granted. All parties, including Turner, were instructed to return to Clouse’s court on Oct. 16 when she will decide on any further actions. 
Meanwhile, EKPC is expected to share all requested documents with Berea College, as part of the discovery phase of the litigation. Berea College is expected to keep the documents confidential. Clouse agreed with the college that if during the document review, the college finds documents it wishes to make public, or if it is discovered that any of the information has already been made public, she would entertain another motion to remove the protective order on a case by case basis. 
Although the college suggested to Clouse that discovery might extend the time for a hearing until next April, the judge said that was too long for a trial such as this, where the line is already in construction. She recommended a hearing on whether EKPC has the right to take the requested parcel of the college’s forest land, be held no later than this coming January.

Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo — want to know how many VA employees lost or left their jobs in RI this year. (Photos by Alexander Castro and Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current; collage by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s congressional delegation is curious about how nationwide staffing cuts at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are affecting VA workers in the Ocean State.
In a Sept. 16 letter collectively penned by U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo, Rhode Island’s all-Democratic delegation asked Veterans Affairs Secretary Douglas Collins to explain recent department data that shows the department has lost thousands of employees this year. 
“VA employees are essential to serving our Veterans,” the delegates wrote. “The alarming rate at which employees are leaving VA jeopardizes Veterans’ ability to timely access services and benefits they have earned and will undermine the VA’s ability to meet its mission for many years.”
The delegates cited the July 25 issue of the VA’s workforce dashboard, which they say shows the loss of more than 8,700 employees who worked with veterans in the current fiscal year, including 2,129 registered nurses, 751 physicians, 1,283 medical support assistants, and 1,294 claims examiners. 
The dashboard also shows that the VA’s year-over-year hiring pipeline is down in all categories, with the amount of job postings, applications and new hires lower this year than at the same time last year. The Veterans Health Administration reported 13,403 fewer employees across all categories than it had at the start of this fiscal year.
The letter asks for a facility-by-facility breakdown of employee departures in Rhode Island since Jan. 1, as well as data on canceled or rescheduled appointments tied to staffing shortages, plus a list of current job vacancies. 
The delegates want data for Eagle Square VA Clinic, Eagle Street VA Clinic, Providence VA Medical Center, Middletown VA Clinic, Providence VA Regional Benefit Office, and the Providence Vet Center. They asked for occupational details on each departure such as reasons for leaving the VA, years of employment with the VA, and whether the employee resigned or was terminated.
The letter asks Collins to respond by Sept. 30.
Pete Kasperowicz, Press secretary for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said in an email Friday that the department would respond directly to the delegation’s letter.
The VA previously announced on Aug. 6 that it was immediately nullifying collective bargaining agreements for VA workers, including those associated with the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, and the Service Employees International Union. 
The department terminated the contracts to comply with a March 27 executive order from President Donald Trump, which excludes parts of the VA, plus other agencies, from the federal labor management statute that allowed for collective bargaining. In 2024, over 1,900 VA employees who were part of bargaining units spent “more than 750,000 hours of work on taxpayer funded union time — including some who are paid more than $200,000 a year,” according to the VA’s news release.
“With no collective bargaining obligations, those hours can now be used to serve Veterans instead of union bosses,” the release reads.
An estimate of the number of employees affected ranges from 350,000 to 400,000 people. 
Rhode Island’s congressional delegates had a different interpretation. 
“Your recent decision to terminate collective bargaining agreements for VA employees will almost certainly make the problem worse, as approximately 80% of VA employees belonged to a union,” they wrote Collins.

Andy Barr. The three spoke at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)At Fancy Farm this summer, Kentucky Republicans were treated to a Senate primary that looked less like a policy debate and more like a contest over style.
Daniel Cameron, Andy Barr and Nate Morris all arrived ready to prove their loyalty to Donald Trump. The question was not whether they support him, but what version of Trump-alignment they could sell to voters in Mitch McConnell’s backyard.
The contrasts were striking. Barr, the Lexington congressman with more than $6 million on hand in July, leaned on the tried-and-true playbook: signs, T-shirts, handshakes, and relentless retail politics.
Cameron, still recalibrating after his 2023 governor’s race loss, presented himself as more laid-back and approachable, conceding he was not the money leader. Reporters noticed a new ease and humor on the trail. 
Morris, by contrast, rolled in with theater. He climbed out of a garbage truck labeled “Nate’s DC Swamp Cleanup Services,” pledged to “trash McConnell’s legacy,” and reveled in the attention. 
That spectacle underscored Kentucky’s unusual political puzzle. This is not Wyoming in 2022, where Trump’s endorsement of Harriet Hageman turned Liz Cheney’s reelection into a referendum on loyalty and ended her career. Nor is it Alaska in 2022, where Lisa Murkowski, an outspoken Trump critic, survived thanks to incumbency and ranked-choice voting. And it is not South Dakota, where John Thune brushed off Trump’s pressure and cruised to reelection in 2022. 
Kentucky’s primary is different because all three Republicans can credibly claim Trump ties. Cameron was endorsed by him in 2023. Barr has never broken with Trump and emphasizes his competence and conservative record. Morris embodies the “drain the swamp” outsider persona, launching his bid on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast and lashing out at McConnell directly. 
Here lies the rub: Kentuckians like Trump, but they also like McConnell. Trump carried the state by roughly 30 points in 2016, 26 points in 2020, and by an even larger margin in 2024, particularly in rural counties. 
At the same time, McConnell’s long tenure has brought prestige and power that many voters respect. Yet nationally, he and Trump were sometimes at odds. After the 2020 election, McConnell privately called Trump “stupid” and “despicable,” according to book excerpts reported by the Associated Press.

Still, McConnell has faced consistently low approval ratings in recent years. Morning Consult polling in 2023 and 2024 repeatedly ranked him as one of the least popular senators in the country. But those numbers have not stopped Republican primary voters in Kentucky from supporting him every six years for nearly four decades, underscoring his resilience at home. Morris’ team must believe their strategy can tap into that unpopularity — either because internal polling suggests an opening or because they think securing Trump’s endorsement would override traditional loyalties.
That contradiction shapes the candidates’ strategies.

Barr is offering Trump-friendly competence with establishment credibility. His advantage is resources and relationships, but he risks being cast as too conventional.
Cameron is running as Trump-aligned but approachable, presenting himself as a neighborly conservative. His challenge is fundraising; charm only goes so far without money to amplify it.
Morris is wagering everything on confrontation, arguing you cannot be pro-Trump while celebrating McConnell, and dramatizing that stance in the senator’s own state. It is a high-risk, high-reward bet.

So what should Kentucky voters make of this? Trump’s dominance inside the Republican Party is no longer in doubt. What remains unsettled is how candidates interpret that dominance in a state that has also long valued McConnell’s clout. In Wyoming, Trump picked a side and the base followed. In Alaska, institutional loyalty saved an anti-Trump incumbent. In South Dakota, seniority and money blunted Trump’s ire.
Kentucky could offer a new model: a contest among three flavors of Trump-alignment — Barr’s establishment competence, Cameron’s neighborly conservatism and Morris’s anti-establishment disruption — playing out in a state that has voted red in every presidential election since 2000 and still tips its hat to McConnell’s influence. 
But another unanswered question looms: if all three are already devoted Trump loyalists, why would Trump even intervene?
If Barr or Cameron prevails, it will suggest Kentucky Republicans are comfortable straddling both camps, embracing Trump without disowning McConnell. If Morris breaks through, it will show that the only way to prove loyalty to Trump is to reject the old order entirely, even when that order is homegrown.
Either way, this primary is not about whether the GOP belongs to Trump. That question has been settled. What is at stake is who gets to define what being Trump-aligned actually looks like in McConnell’s Kentucky, and whether voters believe those two legacies can still coexist under the same red hat.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-09-22 09:23:19+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,"Philadelphia DA Krasner talks National Guard, ICE, and Trump during series of town halls",John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/philadelphia-da-krasner-talks-national-guard-ice-and-trump-during-series-of-town-halls/,Some attendees pushing back on Krasner’s rhetoric and focus.,"Members of the National Guard stationed outside Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Since being sworn in for a second term, President Donald Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and more are on their way to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of what he said is an effort to restore law and order.
In recent weeks, Gov. Josh Shapiro has faced questions about how Pennsylvania would respond if the president turned his attention to Philadelphia.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has been outspoken on the issue. His office held three public events last week to provide advice for what citizens should do, while also sharply criticizing the president’s approach.
“We are here because all over the city are people who do not want an invasion,” Krasner, a Democrat, said at Tuesday night’s event at Salt & Light Church in southwest Philadelphia.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The events were billed as the “Be the Light and Bring the Light” town halls, taking place on three straight nights in different neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Each event ended with Krasner responding to some of the questions submitted via card by audience members.
Krasner said that Trump’s claims of crime being out of control in several big cities, like Philadelphia, were off base. He said he believes there is a different reason.
“This is entirely and specifically an effort to make it normal to have the military in cities, in my opinion, it is entirely and specifically to legitimize more military action later,” Krasner said at Thursday evening’s event at Mother Bethel AME Church in Society Hill.
He told those in attendance, however, that they are not powerless and what they could do to ensure Trump would “leave Philadelphia alone.”
“Get your phone, get your camera, carry it with you. If there are things that you find inappropriate, disturbing, upsetting, whether it’s ICE activity tomorrow or its National Guard, paramilitary, military invasion later: Get the phones up, get that out on social media,” he said. “The fact is, with a million sets of eyes, there’s a whole lot of stuff some people would like to do that’s not gonna get done. And if what they do is a crime, let me see it.”
Krasner said his office would be able to determine if the activity by those in law enforcement from those videos is legal or not legal and would respond appropriately and prosecute them.
He said he believes that public pushback can deter Trump from deciding to send the National Guard to cities like Philadelphia. He cited the president’s recent threat to deploy the guard to Chicago, but ultimately decided against it.

Kate Shaw, a constitutional law scholar and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, joined Krasner for the fireside chat on Tuesday.
Shaw cited the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 as proof that the president does not have the authority to deploy the National Guard domestically. She also noted that a federal judge in California ruled that Trump’s decision to send the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests violated federal law.
“But the bottom line is, it says you can’t send the military in to do civilian peacekeeping,” Krasner said. “The military is for wars. The military is for the enemy. The military is not for us. That’s not what it is, and that has been the law since the Civil War era.”
Philadelphia City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier was the only member of the council to deliver remarks at any of the three events.
“President Trump is trampling over the Constitution and invading cities under the pretext of safety,” Gauthier said. “But tanks rolling down 52nd Street don’t make us safe.”
“Real safety comes from trust between the community and law enforcement,” she added. “It comes from neighbors looking out for each other and from police officers rooted in their communities who are trained as guardians, not to hunt down and kill the enemy.”
Danielle Shaw’s 23-year old daughter was shot and killed in Philadelphia in 2018. She said that she doesn’t believe sending in the National Guard would help combat crime in the city.
“We don’t need the National Guard,” Shaw said. “We need our community. We need our grassroots groups. We need our police department. We need our police department, we need our detectives, we need our lawyers, we don’t need the National Guard.”
Pushback from attendees
Krasner was direct in his criticism of Trump over the three days. During that time, he referred to the president as a wanna-be dictator, a racist, evil, and someone who would like to be king.
“Is the question, will the Pennsylvania legislature and its MAGA members be stupid? Because the answer is, “Yeah,” Krasner said. “I mean, fascist gonna be fascist.”
“These people don’t believe in equality at all. They don’t believe in racial equality. They don’t believe in gender equality. They’re absolutely just as hateful toward women as they are on the issue of race, ” Krasner added. “These are people who agree with Adolf Hitler when he said that equality is a quote ‘degenerate notion,’ unquote.”
Frank Scales, who lives in South Philadelphia, rose to his feet to push back on Krasner’s comments and stated that the district attorney was demonizing Republicans and Trump, and that rhetoric led to the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The motives of Kirk’s alleged shooter remain unclear, although NBC News reported on Saturday that so far “there is no evidence connecting the suspect with any left-wing groups,” and that “every indication so far is that this was one guy who did one really bad thing because he found Kirk’s ideology personally offensive.”
The Associated Press reports he may have been “radicalized” online.
“There is free speech and then there is an effort to stop free speech and what is happening here is the usual right wing effort to silence people who are trying to organize to preserve civil rights,” Krasner responded. “I think the death of Charlie Kirk was awful. I will never justify the murder of another human being.”
Scales left during the second panel discussion and spoke with media members, outside of the church. He said he didn’t plan to challenge Krasner, but called the event a “publicity stunt” when he realized that audience members couldn’t directly ask questions.
Following the event, Krasner told reporters that the use of the word fascist and comparisons to Hilter were “100% necessary” in a time like this, noting his family’s history of military service during World War II.
“It is absolutely necessary to recognize the times we are in to not be appeasers, to not stand by, to not let people take over everything that I believe in and that the city believes in,” Krasner said. “We believe in equality. We believe in freedom. We believe in safety. They don’t believe in any of those things at all. Other people may want to say that Mr. Hitler has a nice mustache. I don’t think so.”
Scales said he supports the National Guard being deployed to Philadelphia, noting that the police department is currently short of the amount of officers they need to have.
“We need dialogue,” Scales said. “So, if Krasner disagrees with Trump, he should say that in good faith, not demonize and call him a fascist. He’s pulling the wool over people’s eyes.”
He is also a founder of Surge Philly, a group that says its mission is to take back Philadelphia by “exposing liberal bias, gut-punching big government, and unleashing free markets.”
In the final moments of Thursday evening’s event, another attendee voiced her displeasure with Krasner.
Judy Robinson said that prevention was key for combating crime in the city.
“I’m in the 22nd District where murder and mayhem is out of control,” she said.
Robinson said that children “are being given guns like crack,” and that she isn’t worried about the National Guard or Donald Trump, but is instead concerned about what can be done to combat crime in her local community. She said she wants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to help address the matter.

ICE also on the minds of Philadelphians
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations was also a topic brought up on several occasions throughout the three-day stretch, with it being a more prominent focus at the event at the Grace Baptist Church of Germantown last Wednesday evening.
“We are specifically protected from federal officials trying to force local officials to enforce their law,” Krasner said. “Frankly, I’d much rather be catching people for homicide than running around catching hardworking kitchen workers who are undocumented.”

“So that I’m clear with you, if somebody comes here and they murder two people, and there’s an interest in deporting them, I’m fine with that, after they finish their sentence. That’s ok with me,” Krasner said. “I am, personally, very much against going after people who are hardworking, who are supporting their families, who are fundamentally law abiding.”
Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal was on hand to explain what her office does, while also fielding a few questions.
“The sheriff’s office does not cooperate with ICE,” she said.
Bilal explained that ICE has an agreement with her office that, among other things, says the agency has to have a valid warrant and cannot come inside the courthouse to arrest anyone.
On the final night, Krasner said the turnout over the three nights had shown him that similar meetings should be held in different parts of the city in the future.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nationalguard-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)There are 169 new affordable homes coming to the greater Richmond area, developers and officials announced last week, following various state and local awards. A recent $1.2 million investment from PlanRVA and the Partnership for Housing Affordability are supporting nine projects — both homes and apartments — that residents who earn 30% to 80% of the area median income can move into. 
Area median income in RIchmond, for example, equals a household salary of about $63,000. This means that people living on nearly $19,000 to about $50,000 per year could qualify as tenants of the new residences in Richmond. Goochland County and Hanover County both have an AMI of about $118,000 while Henrico’s is about $84,000, Chesterfield’s is $101,000, and Powhatan’s is $110,000. 
The funds stemmed from Virginia Housing and were disbursed to organizations like project:HOMES, the Maggie Walker Land Trust, Commonwealth Catholic Charities and various local chapters of Habitat for Humanity throughout Richmond and surrounding counties. 
One of the larger developments is an 83-unit senior citizen apartment complex on Bainbridge Street in Richmond’s Swansboro neighborhood. Matt Morgan with project:HOMES said the location was ideal because it’s near bus stops and presented an opportunity to create infill development on what was once an abandoned building. 
Where a parapet-topped building featuring some apartments with balconies now rises once stood a derelict train servicing station and coal-dumping facility. The crumbling-brick and foliage-covered structure was razed to make way for the new residential space, but part of the building has been preserved and will be the community center – open both to the building’s tenants and neighbors in the area.

While 169 units is relatively small compared to the hundreds of thousands living in the region, it’s169 more individuals or families who will be able to be sheltered as the state and various organizations work to open up more pathways to affordable housing.
Around 30% of residents in Richmond and surrounding counties are cost-burdened, meaning they spend 30% or more of their income on housing, while about 13% of area residents are more severely burdened,  spending 50% or more of their income on housing. 
In Richmond, several neighborhoods have seen new housing construction in recent years, but much of that has been market-rate. The new projects coming online through the housing-focused nonprofits means there will be 169 more opportunities for those in need. 
Members of the various nonprofits joined The Mercury for a tour of the Bainbridge Street development recently to discuss bolstering partnerships with each other and ways state and local governments can keep supporting their work. 
Morgan said that interest rates jumped when project:HOMES was beginning work on the apartments. But when Richmond released a performance grant, it absorbed the interest rate. 
“That meant dollars and cents to the project, so that actually saved this deal,” he said. 
As Richmond is undergoing a local code refresh, PHA director Jovan Burton emphasized how that can help developers create more infill and more dense development in areas. 
An often hyper-local issue, some state lawmakers have worked to help support localities that are trying to address affordability issues. It’s not always easy, however, when tensions between local and state governments emerge. 
A Dillon Rule state, local governments have authority over things like local land use and zoning decisions. State lawmakers have worked on policies that can create flexibility for localities or instances where the state could step in. The ideas don’t always get across the finish line.
But some proposals have passed and been implemented. Now-Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond passed a bill while in the Virginia General Assembly to encourage infill development. More recently a proposal to allow faith-based organizations to build housing on land they already own has been mirrored in a federal proposal. Both have yet to pass, but could prove helpful if they do. 
“It would always be great to have more resources at the state level to support housing, to pair and leverage local dollars,” Burton said.

(Photos by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Workforce development and education leaders said during a Friday summit that Virginia needs to shake things up to continue meeting the surging health care workforce demand across the commonwealth, while also making it easier for educational institutions to offer programs that diverge from the traditional college preparation route. 
According to a study by George Mason University’s Center for Health Workforce, Virginia needs more than 17,000 registered nurses and 10,000 medical and human services managers.
Kathleen deLaski, the author of “Who Needs College Anymore?” recommended the “step-ladder” approach to higher education as a method to consider moving into the future during Claude Moore’s annual health care workforce summit in Richmond.
“We need a step ladder approach to college,” deLaski said. “Rather than being afraid or concerned that they’re going to go out of business if they add products or services besides four-year degrees or two-year degrees, (colleges) should embrace the array of offerings that they could be providing for all. Not just the elite or the middle class, but all types of learners.”
deLaski said she did not write her book to discourage people from going to college, but rather to serve as a “wake-up call” for higher education, noting that 60% of Americans do not complete college. 
She noted that the country’s policy system favors funding four-year institutions over short-term and workforce development programs.
However, recent federal reform efforts are expanding Pell Grants to workforce training programs, changes that could begin as early as next summer. Another reform measure for colleges and universities: the government will verify whether graduates are actually earning a decent income afterward. The U.S. Department of Education extended the reporting deadline to Sept. 30. 
Panelists, including Virginia Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera, Virginia Community College System Chancellor David Doré, and Lesa Hanlin, executive director of strategic initiatives and corporate relations at the University of Virginia, discussed some of the barriers and possible solutions, including challenging what has become the norm in education.

Guidera said one way Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration proposed a new method was successfully encouraging the General Assembly to back and fund the establishment of the laboratory schools, which are developed and operated in partnership with colleges and universities and designed to offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology. Legislation to establish lab schools in Virginia first passed in 2012 under former Gov. Bob McDonnell. 
“Lab schools are basically what people are doing every single day, which is connecting the dots, bringing people together saying ‘how can we invest in people so they are ready for the jobs in healthcare,” Guidera said, adding that she hopes funding will continue with the next administration.
“Lab schools, apprenticeships, internships, partnerships — this is what’s critical to get over the inertia of ‘keep doing education’ and saying what we’ve always been doing because it’s not working what we have been doing, and this is the future,” Guidera added. 
Former Del. Kathy Bryon, who was one of the panelists, carried a few pieces of successful legislation around workforce development including one to create the state’s FastForward, a short-term career credential training program, and another measure that led to the development of the Department of Workforce Development and Advancement, or Virginia Works, to centralize oversight of workforce development programs and data systems.
Byron, now a deputy commissioner with Virginia Works, said employers are telling the team that a college degree by itself is no longer the right indicator of readiness. 
“What matters is the skills they bring, the competences they bring, the experiences that they bring on the job,” Byron said.
Panelists also shared a consistent theme of changing the narrative to ensure all Virginians — from students to parents, veterans, to new career seekers — understand that entities, including the Virginia Community College System, are here to support them.
The event attracted more than 100 stakeholders from school systems and businesses around Virginia.

Bill Hazel, CEO of Claude Moore Opportunities and former Virginia Secretary of Health, said in a statement that the event was an “amazing gathering” of people focused on creating “family sustaining career opportunities” while meeting the state’s health care needs.
“There are rewarding and critically needed positions waiting to be filled throughout the healthcare system, but too often people don’t know how to get the training and credentials they need, or face barriers that keep them out of the healthcare workforce,” Hazel said. “When we invest in flexible, accessible career pathways in healthcare, we lift more Virginians into the middle class and help our fellow Virginians live healthier lives.”

(Photo by Janie Segui Rodriguez/Stop the Wait)The drove of parents in yellow T-shirts who trooped up the stairs in Providence’s City Hall to the City Council chambers on July 24 hoped they were heading for the grand finale of months of advocacy for a desirable new school. Their T-shirts were emblazoned with Stop the Wait, a nonprofit that helps parents understand their rights and champions public school options so children from low-income families aren’t trapped in schools they don’t like. 
That night the City Council was ready to vote on a proposal to lease the vacant Carl Lauro Elementary School building on Kenyon Street to Excel Academy for 35 years. The deal included $80 million for a full renovation on Excel’s dime, as well as lush ancillary benefits to Providence’s district schools, families, the city, and the neighborhood surrounding an abandoned eyesore residents had put up with for two years. The cost to the city for maintenance and security of the vacant school: $300,000 a year.
Stop the Wait registered each on-the-ground advocate. CEO Janie Sequi Roderiquez said 419 parents made thousands of phone calls and knocked on thousands of doors to solicit support. 
While the parents and nonprofit advocates worked, City Council President Rachel Miller negotiated the lease with Mayor Brett Smiley and Excel staff. A July 17 council newsletter outlined the details of the deal that had been carefully vetted with public meetings and a feasibility study. 
But the parents knew there could be trouble. Because 24 hours earlier, Miller did a whiplash 180 and insisted the council vote against it. 
Despite a new sound system, the council chamber’s acoustics are so bad, participants strain to hear and be heard. 
When the vote took place, a triumphal whoop went up. Some families joined the clapping and hugging to celebrate what they assumed was a victory for their kids. 
It was not. 
The lease died on an 8-4 vote. The applause actually originated with Providence Public School District (PPSD) teachers, dressed in familiar blue T-shirts, who show up at education-related public meetings. As translations and corrections circulated, parents were shocked to learn the teachers weren’t with them after all. A dark sense of betrayal replaced their initial confusion. Tears broke out.

The parents learned the hard way that the lease had little to do with serving the public or shepherding scarce resources. It was about protecting union jobs by vilifying charters with sentiments verging on hatred. Charters are public schools — publicly accountable, publicly supported, though underfunded compared with district schools — that are not necessarily unionized. 
Political dignitaries conduct silly “listening tours” but won’t hear the hard data screaming from the charter waiting lists where thousands of families languish. Parents of all economic classes want public charter seats because they’d prefer diverse, effective, taxpayer-funded public schools. Excel will open eventually as soon as it finds a private building that will come off the city’s tax rolls, unlike the disused Carl Lauro building.
You’d think the council would be salivating at the $80 million. Last November, the city lost a $15 million lawsuit brought by the Department of Education for underfunding what the state deemed its share of the per pupil expenditure. This unbudgeted expense forced the city to ask the General Assembly to let it override the 4% cap on raising the city’s total tax levy, per state law. City residents and businesses were outraged. 










As translations and corrections circulated, parents were shocked to learn the teachers weren’t with them after all. A dark sense of betrayal replaced their initial confusion. Tears broke out.


And lest the taxpayers of greater Rhode Island feel they have no stake in Providence school problems, actually they pay almost half of Providence’s per pupil expenditure and their taxes reimburse 80% of school capital expenditures. The lack of a Lauro School lease is now a state problem. 
In a July 23 council newsletter, Miller stated: “The city council will not hand the keys of a shuttered public school building to a charter school.”
Up until 24 hours earlier, the only organization that didn’t like the deal was the teachers union, a private-sector business which, like all unions, exists to benefit clients and not the public mission those clients are supposed to serve. 
A teacher’s July 21st Facebook post reads: “We did it guys! It didnt (sic) pass and public school teachers showed up. Excellent Video. We must remain steadfast! … Bravo to ALL who have supported PUBLIC schools that serve ALL students (unlike charter schools)” – which is not only not true, but illegal by state law.
The “excellent video” shows Councilor Miguel Sanchez and school board member Cory Jones malign charters in a stream of misinformation and flat-out lies that would take an entire column to rebut. 
At the July 17 ordinance meeting, Sanchez also said, “I’d rather have an empty building there, that we’re paying $300,00 for (per year), than to give it over to a charter school system.” 
At the same meeting, Councilor Justin Rois said, “We’re giving a few lifeboats away and keeping students in PPSD on a sinking ship…” Councilor, did you hear yourself? PPSD was a sinking ship in the early 1990s when I joined the Providence School Board. Without serious structural changes, the schools have no hope of getting better and never did.
To use Rois’ description of the schools, the obvious thing to do would be to provide as many lifeboats as we possibly can until the sinking ship either sinks or makes itself attractive enough to compete with the desirable schools the council so denigrates.
So, here you are, Rhode Island. These are your tax dollars at work.
Bring on the lifeboats.

A new survey of more than 700 Hampton Roads residents found that a majority expect major risks from flooding in the decades to come.
But people’s perceptions of flood risk varied widely depending on where they live and their demographic background, suggesting potential disparities in how the impacts of flooding are felt across the seven cities.
Questions about flooding were part of Old Dominion University’s annual Life in Hampton Roads survey, which aims to gain insight into residents’ opinions on topics including politics, health, education and the economy. The 2025 survey was conducted online, instead of via phone as in previous years.
Tancy Vandecar-Burdin, director of ODU’s Social Science Research Center, said the answers show flooding is on most residents’ minds.
“I think residents’ perceptions are reflecting reality,” she said. They are “recognizing the risk of flooding to their homes and neighborhoods and to their city as a whole.”
About 72% of respondents believed there is some or a high risk of severe flooding from sea level rise in their city over the next 30 years. Residents of Norfolk were the most likely to report risk, followed closely by Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
The proportion dropped off as the questions got more granular: About 53% of people reported risk in their specific neighborhood, and 43% to their individual property.

The ODU survey has frequently included questions about flooding and climate change, but the specific questions vary each year.
This year, officials were particularly interested in learning about the impacts of flooding on housing, reflecting growing concerns about affordable housing.
Flooding is an exacerbating factor, Vandecar-Burdin said. As flooding gets more severe, it could make some places unlivable, reducing the housing stock while making lower-risk areas less affordable.
Some Hampton Roads residents already believe the issue is impacting their property’s worth.
Almost a third of respondents said they believe flood risk has somewhat or greatly affected their area’s property values – especially in Norfolk, where the percentage was nearly half.
Black residents and those with lower household incomes were significantly more likely to report decreased property values.
Vandecar-Burdin said that’s in line with other research that shows marginalized communities are more vulnerable to flooding.
“Folks that have higher socioeconomic status have greater capacity and resources, which allow them to be more selective about where they buy or rent their home,” she said.

But increasing perceptions of flood risk don’t seem to be drastically changing people’s behavior, she said.
Only about a quarter of respondents said flood risk information influenced decisions about their current housing. And rates of buying flood insurance have barely budged since the surveys began 15 years ago.
Vandecar-Burdin said she hopes the findings will encourage local leaders to help provide residents with information on how to assess and mitigate their risk.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)As the first fall leaves drifted to the ground in Damascus Town Park on a recent warm September day, Mayor Katie Lamb spoke to an audience just off the Virginia Creeper Trail trailhead. One year ago, Laurel Creek began to rise and quickly flooded downtown — washing away homes and battering businesses.
“Helene came in with a vengeance, and she may have damaged and destroyed our structures, but she did not shatter our Appalachian mountain virtues or our love for our town,” Lamb said.

Reportedly, 140 structures in Damascus were damaged or destroyed – bringing an estimated $12 million in damages to residential properties, businesses and public facilities. The state endured an estimated $4 billion in damage and hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of debris were strewn across the region. Three people in Virginia died as a result of the storm, as well as over 250 people in other states.
In Damascus, home to 747 residents, the floodwaters washed out bridges and trestles, sending debris slamming into each  bridge until it gave way and the surging currents flowed down to the next. The Laurel Creek water gauge read 18 feet before it was washed away. 
As the mayor spoke 12 months after the devastating storm, crews could be heard jackhammering away the former bridge on Orchard Hill Road. The washed out bridge still rests on the banks, evidence of the sheer force of the flood waters that came through.

While people were rushing to save their homes and lives, the livelihood of many in the region was being washed away farther east. 
Multiple popular hiking and biking trails, such as the Appalachian Trail, converge near Damascus. Many of the town businesses are catered to visitors who wish to bike the 34-mile gravel trail that stretches from Abingdon to White Top along old train routes. The most popular portion is from White Top to Damascus, as it is mostly downhill and shaded in trees. Helene’s flooding almost wiped that portion off the map completely.

“We lost so much the day that the trail flooded. October’s always the busiest month, and that’s how we get through the winter by having a huge October,” said Michael Wright, owner of Adventure Damascus Bicycles and another business.
Developers are currently bidding on rebuilding the 17-mile portion of the trail that was most frequented by bikers of all ages. There is a tentative timeline of it reopening by October 2026. The project is estimated to cost $200-300 million.
Seated in the office of one of his stores, Wright said business is down about 75% for his bicycle rental and shuttle storefront. His employees took calls in the background, explaining to customers that the popular part of the trail is going to be closed for at least another year. Hundreds of bikes are lined up in the back of the building, waiting to be taken out. 
Wright’s other business, which outfits Appalachian Trail hikers, is down about 30% this year despite the trail being fully open. About 400 miles of the trail was closed across multiple states immediately after the storm.

He had never seen flooding like that in all his years living in the area. In all his years living in the area, Wright said he’s never seen flooding like Helene’s. His bicycle rental store along Laurel Creek had multiple inches of water in it. He had to lay off most of his employees in the wake of the storm, but has been able to hire back some of them, mostly part-time workers. 
“So, you know, everything’s just gone, in an instant. We didn’t know what to do, where to go, but we just started cleaning up,” Wright said.
Two homes just across the trail that runs alongside his store were washed away in the flood and have already been replaced. When Wright posted on Facebook that the bike shop doors were open again months after the flood, a couple that had been coming to Damascus for years drove all the way from Alabama to give them business and support them through tough times.
“I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years, but over the years, people come to town and they love coming to town. I love the place so much,” Wright said. “I didn’t realize as many people had the same feeling that I did. But it makes perfect sense. That’s why they keep coming back.”
The town has been working hard to leverage other activities and the second half of the Creeper Trail to show visitors that they are still open for business. 
“We’re nervous about this winter for sure. We have a lot of hope now that the trail will be open next year,” Wright said.
Down the main drag of town, Blue Blaze is another bike rental shop that has had to adjust to operating with only a portion of the Creeper Trail open. Owner Rich DeArmond, at his front desk  that still bears the water marks of Helene’s flooding, explained that he has invested in more e-bikes to help people bike the Damascus to Abingdon portion of the trail, which is not as downhill and more of a challenge for some riders. He describes this shift as a new beginning.

The town parks and recreation department has been emphasizing other draws to town such as trout fishing, hiking trails, and the overall peacefulness of the small community nestled in the middle of the mountains. Most of the businesses that were flooded are back open and looking for visitors to come in the door.
“We could either sit around and be sad, or we could do something about it, and so we decided to do everything we could to bring Damascus back,” Julie Kroll, the town recreation director, said.
Right next to where the bridge over Laurel Creek was washed out, Jennifer Walker had owned a rental home for six years. At the time of the storm she had tenants staying there who, fortunately, evacuated in time as the water quickly rose and eventually destroyed the house.
Walker and her family live just across the North Carolina border, a state that was lashed most severely by Helene. Their home was hit with a powerful mudslide that knocked part of the house off the foundation and ripped portions off to be carried away. They did not live in a floodplain and did not have flood insurance so they’ve had to rely on a small award from FEMA and slowly put what they can back into its reconstruction.
“In the back of our heads, we’re like, this is horrible, but we have our Damascus house. So we have a place to go … we went up to the top of our mountain, tried 81 times to make a phone call, and I got one call through to my mom. And at the same time, a video came through from the renters, and they said, ‘we’re sorry, it’s bad’,” Walker said.
While the home that held many memories of wintering in Damascus for them, Walker is eager for her new venture to come to life. In the spirit of the Creeper Trail, she has purchased two train cabooses that will be made into a hotel. She hopes it will be a fun experience for people who come through to ride the trail that passes right next to the property.
“You know, it’s just one of those things where you’re like, I’m glad that this town has bounced back.  It’s cool. I mean, it’s just, and I’m not saying that because I have a place here, but it is a really special little town,” Walker said.
Washington County residents were awarded $2.4 million in individual assistance from FEMA; $2.1 million of that was distributed in Damascus. The nonprofit Trails to Recovery has raised $1.7 million in private donations and aided in repairing 83 homes and doing complete rebuilds of eight houses for county residents since the storm.
In April, Gov. Glenn Youngkin accelerated unlocking funds from the $46,670,000 allocated to Virginia by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through disaster recovery grants. A number of disaster loans were made available to southwest Virginians who were in need of assistance to build back their homes and businesses.
With the construction of the trail set to begin in the coming months, there are efforts to have workers stay in town and utilize local businesses for transportation to work sites. Wright said there is a possibility of his shuttle being used – which would help them survive the winter financially. The Old Mill Inn operators said they hope to have some workers stay there.

Lamb became emotional during a tour of local businesses, explaining how hard they’ve worked to bounce back. She said they’ll never know the names of all the volunteers who flocked to the town to help people muck out their homes and rebuild structures. Damascus is hosting an event on Sept. 27, the day the waters rose, to show appreciation for those who helped them. 
The town of Damascus has a population of less than 1,000. But during certain events that all revolve around the trails in the area, thousands of people gather there. When walking downtown now, it could be hard for out of towners to know what devastation was wrought there only a year ago. There are signs of it in the water lines on wood, the erosion of the water fronts, and the ongoing construction. But the spirit of Damascus has not diminished and residents are still welcoming visitors, whom they say are a lifeline of their community’s economy. 
“We’re going to be better than we’ve ever been because we have each other, and we are damn strong,” Lamb said.

(Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)Colleges have an obligation to create a culture that fosters free speech, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during recent comments at the Ohio Department of Higher Education’s Trustees Conference. 
DeWine covered many topics during his nearly 50 minute speech including briefly talking about free speech on campuses, cell phones in college classrooms, and how colleges of education are training future teachers when it comes to teaching students how to read. 
He did not mention Ohio’s new higher education law, Senate Bill 1, that bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion, among other things.

“The horrible, horrible, horrible tragedy, Charlie Kirk on a college campus, engaging in free speech, being gunned down,” DeWine said. “I’m talking about the obligation, I think, that colleges have to create a culture … colleges should be a place of ideas.”  
Kirk, a right-wing political activist, was shot and killed last week while he was speaking at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. 
“I’m not really talking about (Kirk’s death), how that could have been prevented or couldn’t have been prevented,” DeWine said. “That’s a security issue.”
Universities, he said, need to create an environment on campus that respects ideas. 
“You might disagree with one of your fellow students, but that’s kind of what college is all about,” DeWine said. “It’s exploring and getting different ideas. … Free speech is important. It’s important everywhere, but it’s also super important, I think, in the village of college campuses.”
Cell phones 
Ohio recently banned cell phones in K-12 schools and DeWine wants college students to put their phones away, too. 
“I suggest you ban them in your classrooms,” he said. “It’s that simple.”
When speaking to reporters afterwards, DeWine said he does not think there should necessarily be a law around cell phones in colleges. 
“I don’t think we’re looking to tell colleges to (ban cell phones),” DeWine said. “That was a strong suggestion. … What we know about these devices is that they pull people away from thinking about what’s going on in that classroom.” 
Reading 
This is the second school year Ohio school districts are required to teach the science of reading, which incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. DeWine has helped champion the science of reading in Ohio by originally putting it in the state’s 2023 budget, which was eventually signed into law.
“Think phonics on steroids,” DeWine said. “Reading, to state the obvious, is essential to success in K-12, it’s essential to your success in college. It’s more importantly, though, essential to your success in life.”
The Ohio Department of Higher Education conducted an audit to show how each educator training program aligns with teaching the science of reading instruction. Under state law, Chancellor Mike Duffey can revoke a college or university’s approval if they fail the audit. 
The audits are completed, and colleges and universities with educator training program will be hearing their results in the coming months, DeWine said. 
“I’ve seen the results,” he said. “Some of them are great, but some of them are not. We still have colleges in the state of Ohio that do not follow the science of reading. That’s a problem.”

Situated between Charleston and Parkersburg, two of the state’s largest cities, the rural county is known for its small towns and historic buildings.
That’s how Sherry Husted, the director of the Roane County Public Libraries, described her native community as she worked last week at Geary Public Library in Left Hand, West Virginia. Each of the county’s three library branches has at least three public computers and free internet access, among other services.
These services are essential to residents living in Roane — where less than 32% of the county’s households, businesses and community buildings — have reliable internet connectivity, according to the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map.
“We love our rural area,” Husted said. “But there’s always the catch. You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.”
Members of the library staff regularly help patrons fill out job applications and build resumes. They also help those who have never used a desktop computer before — many of the county’s residents rely on their cellular devices and spotty mobile service, Husted said. Most residents still use landline phones, she added.
And those with internet access at home are paying a steep price. Husted’s plan with Frontier, which includes fiber internet and a landline, comes to $170 a month.
“If you work from home, you need reliable internet,” she said. “Frontier does the best they can. But this is a very rural area, so the trees and terrain are constantly messing up the internet. And because of the demand on these older lines, your internet may not be reliable enough to host things like meetings or classes.”
Roane County is one of the areas federal officials hoped to support through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access. The $42.45 billion initiative, created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aimed to close the digital divide — with a focus on rural communities.
The Trump administration’s changes to the program, however, have disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations — including homes, businesses and community buildings — from receiving internet access. And the program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the federal funds toward satellite internet companies, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, that cost less to build but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable.  That means households and businesses that were looking forward to reliable, high-speed internet will no longer get support from the BEAD program.
While some experts were initially skeptical about the program’s goals, every state utilized its allocated funds to develop plans to provide high-speed fiber internet to nearly every home and business in the country, said Christopher Mitchell, the director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-corporate advocacy group.
Most states are expected to get started on deployment projects in 2026. But the Trump administration’s changes have undermined the major investment for rural areas, Mitchell said.
“I think everyone should care about it — even though most people don’t live in rural America — because when we electrified the entire country, the entire economy grew,” Mitchell said. “We will all benefit from this when everyone has more options to share their knowledge, their gifts and their productivity in the economy.”
Even West Virginia, ranking last in internet connectivity, would have effectively achieved universal broadband under the state’s original proposal, according to an unreleased draft of the state’s plan obtained by The Benton Institute for Broadband and Society, a policy group. West Virginia has about 78% connectivity, the only state with less than 80%.
But under West Virginia’s updated final proposal, submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration earlier this month, tens of thousands of households and businesses will no longer have access to BEAD funding.
West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he is still optimistic about the rollout, telling reporters recently that some of the decrease in coverage was because of inaccurate information. Some areas had just a few homes, or addresses only had a barn on the property, he and an aide said.
“We’ve been trying to target all the available locations that are eligible,” the governor said Sept. 18 at a news conference at the West Virginia State Capitol. “It’s a pretty fulsome application, and so obviously there were some changes made to accommodate some of the responses from the administration. And in a positive way, they’re trying to save money.”
There are other changes: Internet providers  will no longer be required to provide a low-cost service option to residents to address affordability concerns. And under the “technology-neutral” approach, some locations will no longer be receiving fiber internet, which the federal government previously emphasized due to its speed and durability.










You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.

The new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
West Virginia isn’t alone. Under the new rules, thousands of households, businesses and community buildings across the country will be disqualified from the federal government’s push to provide internet access to the areas that need itmost. And those locations that are still eligible for funding may not receive the best service available — or be able to afford it.
West Virginia has one of the country’s worst workforce participation rates. Internet access is key to changing that, said Bill Bissett, chairman of the West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council.
“We are hopeful that this new proposal will be supported because we need to get started on this development as soon as possible,” Bissett said. “Because the longer we wait, the less people will be connected because of increased costs in deployment and infrastructure.”

Following the required revisions, West Virginia fared well compared with other states, said Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. But Garner said he expects frustration in other states.
“West Virginia, because it did a good job with its restructuring, is still going to have a lot of strong outcomes,” Garner said. “But across the country in some of these other states, I think there’s going to be a lot of frustration with these changes and the way it walked back from what was going to be a very promising outcome.”
BEAD restructuring
In June, the Trump administration revised the rules of the BEAD program in what the U.S. Department of Commerce said was an effort to lessen regulatory burdens, reduce costs and streamline the process.
As of Sept. 18, 41 states had submitted their updated final proposals, according to a database from Connected Nation, a nonprofit that advocates for expanded broadband access.
In December 2022, when the FCC released its updated National Broadband Map, nearly 12 million locations across the country were in need of internet service. Over the years, that number has decreased because of private investments, continued deployment by existing internet providers and additional support from other federal programs.
States originally identified 4.86 million locations that would be eligible for getting internet connectivity through BEAD funds. But that number is projected to fall to 4.19 million locations following revisions initiated by the Trump administration, according to an analysis from Broadband Expanded, a project from the New York Law School.
West Virginia was originally slated to deploy broadband to approximately 110,000 locations. Now, 73,560 of those locations will receive BEAD funding, according to the state’s new proposal. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nebraska and Rhode Island could see more than half of the locations in their state disqualified from the program.
But some of those locations may still be in need of internet, said Garner, of the Benton Institute.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, directed states to remove certain locations from the BEAD program because they’d acquired internet access from another source.
But, in an effort to save taxpayer money, states also had the option to say they were “financially incapable” of serving a location.
“One of the changes the administration made to the BEAD program is that states and the NTIA now have a way to simply say that these locations are just too expensive,” Garner said. “They can say, ‘It is just going to cost too much, so now we’re going to say they’re ineligible.’”
Trump’s broadband program overhaul favors Musk tech, strips low-cost plans

The BEAD program’s new technology-neutral approach poses another challenge. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations. But some argue that other technologies would be cheaper.
This change has opened the door for satellite internet providers, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, to receive money from the program. Starlink could be awarded approximately $10 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In West Virginia, Starlink will serve more than 4,100 locations, according to the governor’s office.
“Based on the technology and based on all the evidence we have, some of these technologies — unlicensed fixed wireless especially — are not really a reliable internet service that’s going to meet the needs of a 21st century household,” Garner said.
Rural advocates speak up
In Nebraska, more than half of the counties in the state have signed onto letters to federal officials objecting to the changes, including the disqualification of nearly half the state’s eligible locations.
“It’s very frustrating. We have all these holes in our county, and BEAD was going to bring service to those areas,” Milford County Commissioner Misty Ahmic told the Nebraska Examiner.
Critics in Pennsylvania have said directing funds toward satellite companies is “shortsighted.” Satellite companies Starlink and Project Kuiper, an Amazon subsidiary, were awarded a combined $19.2 million to expand internet access in Pennsylvania.
And in Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated BEAD funds.
The state’s head broadband official said the new proposal would still serve everyone, but critics told the Oklahoma Voice that it would be wrong to send back any federal money while people across the state continue to struggle with internet access.
Originally, states were allowed to use these leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment, such as West Virginia’s plans to improve cellular service and streamline the permitting process for broadband projects. But the federal telecommunications agency has not released guidance on how the leftover funds are to be used under the restructured program.
“There’s a lot of fear right now that NTIA may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Garner said. “That leftover money is the state’s, according to the law. And these ancillary funds would play a huge role to support the BEAD program.”
Affordability also will be a barrier for some households. States are no longer required to provide a low-cost service option for low-income households under the changes. And the federal Affordable Connectivity Program ended last year without additional funding from Congress.
Morrisey said his administration is being aggressive, collaborating with the Trump administration to get internet access to eligible areas.
“I applaud the Trump administration for working with us, but once again, I am not going to do a victory lap until we actually get this all done,” the governor said.
Providing internet to every person in West Virginia was always a lofty goal, said Husted, the Roane County Public Library director.  Other initiatives have promised to connect rural residents over the years, Husted said, and she remains skeptical about this outcome.
“In rural areas, you’re going to need to plan for things, and sometimes that puts us at a disadvantage compared to the cities,” Husted said. “With the internet or with other supplies, sometimes we have to decide what is more important to us.”

The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has sparked a wave of political commentary.
There were the respectful and sincere comments condemning the killing. Former President Barack Obama said, “What happened was a tragedy and … I mourn for him and his family.” And former Vice President Mike Pence said, “I’m heartsick about what happened to him.”
But Kirk’s killing also elicited what many saw as inappropriate comments. MSNBC terminated commentator Matthew Dowd after he said, “Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.” American Airlines grounded pilots accused of celebrating Kirk’s death.
Perhaps the most notable reaction to remarks seen as controversial about the Kirk killing hit ABC comedian Jimmy Kimmel. His network suspended him indefinitely after comments that he made about the alleged shooter in Kirk’s death.
Countless defenders of Kimmel quickly responded to his indefinite suspension as an attack on the First Amendment. MSNBC host Chris Hayes posted the following on X: “This is the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I’ve ever seen in my life and it’s not even close.”
But is it?
 
 FCC Chairman Brendan Carr’s statement about how Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks could hurt ABC affiliate stations.


Free speech? It depends
The First Amendment limits government officials from infringing one’s right to free speech and expression.
For example, the government cannot force someone to recite the Pledge of Allegiance or salute the American flag, because the First Amendment, as one Supreme Court justice wrote, “includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.”
And government cannot limit speech that it finds disagreeable while permitting other speech that it favors.
However, the First Amendment does not apply to private employers. With the exception of the 13th Amendment, which generally prohibits slavery, the Constitution applies only to government and those acting on its behalf.
So, as a general rule, employers are free to discipline employees for their speech – even the employees’ speech outside of the workplace. In this way, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham correctly said on X, “Free speech doesn’t prevent you from being fired if you’re stupid and have poor judgment.”
This is why Amy Cooper’s employer, an investment firm, was free to terminate her following her 2020 verbal dispute in New York’s Central Park with a bird-watcher over her unleashed dog. She called the police, falsely claiming that the bird-watcher, a Black man, was threatening her life. The incident, captured on video, went viral and Cooper was fired, with her employer saying, “We do not condone racism of any kind.”
This is also why ABC was able to fire Roseanne Barr from the revival of her show, “Roseanne,” after she posted a tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a Black woman who had been a top aide to President Obama, that many viewed as racist.
But as a scholar of constitutional law, I believe Kimmel’s situation is not as straightforward.

Threat complicates things
Neither Cooper’s employer nor Barr’s employer faced any government pressure to terminate them.
Kimmel’s indefinite suspension followed a vague threat from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr. As complaints about Kimmel’s statement exploded in conservative media, Carr suggested in a podcast interview that Kimmel’s statements could lead to the FCC revoking ABC affiliate stations’ licenses.
“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said.
But the Supreme Court has been crystal clear. Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.
In a 2024 case, National Rifle Association v. Vullo, a unanimous Supreme Court plainly said that the government’s threat of invoking legal sanctions and other coercion to suppress speech it doesn’t like violates the First Amendment. That principle is so profound and fundamental that it got support from every member of an often bitterly divided court.
A threat to revoke broadcast licenses would almost certainly be seen in a court of law as a government action tantamount to coercion. And Carr’s public comments undoubtedly connect that threat to Kimmel’s disfavored comments.
If the FCC had indeed moved to strip ABC affiliates of their licenses to broadcast because of what Kimmel said, ABC and its parent company, Disney, could have sued the FCC to block the license revocations on First Amendment grounds, citing the NRA v. Vullo case.
But the network seemingly caved to the coercive threat instead of fighting for Kimmel. This is why so many are decrying the Kimmel suspension as an attack on free speech and the First Amendment – even though they might not fully understand the law they’re citing.

(Getty Images)As data center development takes off across the United States and the world, New Hampshire legislators and regulators are weighing what steps their state, and its aging electric grid, should take to prepare.
“For me, it’s worth considering. There may be an opportunity here, but I think there’s also concerns,” said Sen. David Watters, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Data centers — large, energy-hungry facilities housing computer networks — are rapidly becoming more common nationwide, data center developer Craig McGahey told New Hampshire lawmakers and energy professionals at the 2025 New Hampshire Energy Summit, organized by consulting and lobbying firm Dupont Group on Sept. 15.
The rise of artificial intelligence is the biggest factor contributing to increasing data center demand, McGahey said, citing competition among so-called “hyperscalers” — expansive cloud computing companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and others. 
“As this race for AI dominance continues, we don’t see it stopping, and it’s going to continue on for many, many years,” he said.
Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports. And as of March 2025, the United States had more of the facilities than any other nation, according to a Statista tally. 
In other states, some of which have hundreds of data centers, the facilities have strained electric grids and, in some cases, water supplies. Yet, for now, New Hampshire is not among those: 10 relatively small-scale facilities were listed statewide on the website Data Center Map as of September 2025, putting New Hampshire in the bottom fifth nationally.
Some see an ‘emerging market.’ Others, an environmental threat.
That may, however, be set to change. Low power availability and high electricity costs have so far been the principal factors preventing an influx of data centers in New Hampshire like that seen in some other states, McGahey said. But he added that he considered the Northeast as a whole an “emerging market” for the centers.
Developers like himself, he said, were assessing different states’ regulatory landscapes, land availability, and power supplies to determine where to site new centers, which can range in size from normal office buildings to projects spanning hundreds of acres.
Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.
Citing property tax revenue and employment benefits, some legislators said they wanted to see New Hampshire create a regulatory environment that would favor data centers. 
“I think New Hampshire should court any business into the state,” said Rep. Doug Thomas, vice chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, in an interview. “In order for them to come here, there has to be a market. And so we have to … show them that we’re interested.” 
He and House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Chair Michael Vose cited construction and jobs as a primary benefit of growing data centers in New Hampshire. In his presentation, McGahey said a data center of the scale likely to be established in New Hampshire could employ as many as 40 people full-time, and potentially hundreds more during construction. 
Others questioned whether those estimates represented enough jobs to make a meaningful impact on employment. Rep. Thomas Cormen, a member of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, said in an interview the amount of people employed by data centers does not typically scale up proportionally as the centers increase in size. And, he added, for a relatively uncomplicated building like the typical warehouse-style data center, the construction phase might not last particularly long, meaning the bulk of jobs created would be temporary. 
Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries. “Some of the biggest ones employ maybe 100 to 200 people at a $40,000 (annual) salary,” Watters said. “I mean, that’s McDonalds. … They might make close to $40,000, too.”
Cormen also raised environmental concerns. Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said. This could be harmful to the river itself or cause dangerous ice dams and flooding in winter, he said. 
“I think a lot of people have environmental concerns, and power concerns,” Watters said. 
Uncertainty about how data centers would be powered, Cormen said, is another hurdle; while drawing from the grid could raise electricity costs for other ratepayers, the type and effects of unregulated local generators are another unknown.
“Before you know it, we’re talking about diesel generation,” he said. “We just don’t know.”
Speculating to meet demand
Some states have weighed implementing special rate schedules to offset the impact of increased on-grid data center demand on ratepayers, but Vose said he did not expect the New Hampshire Legislature to consider such a system in the near future.
Instead, Vose and other legislators discussed ways to increase New Hampshire’s electricity generation down the road, including through speculative technology like small, modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs.
The New Hampshire Department of Energy is assessing whether SMRs could someday be implemented in New Hampshire, Director of Energy Innovation Thomas Barrasso said at the summit. SMRs could power data centers within “microgrids,” small regionalized power grids that could operate either independently of or in tandem with the rest of the grid, he said.
“I think the microgrid piece of this, the grid modernization piece of this, the SMR piece of this kind of all start to fit together,” Barrasso said.
At the summit, Barrasso expressed optimism about small modular reactors, saying he felt the tide of public opinion toward nuclear energy was changing. A Gallup poll published in April supported this impression, showing 61% of Americans in favor of nuclear power — a six percentage point increase over the previous poll in 2023.
However, SMR critics point out that the technology is still in development, questioning Barrasso’s statement at the summit that they could eventually be “plug and play” solutions to bolster New Hampshire’s energy offerings. It may be anywhere from five to 15 years before the generators could hypothetically be deployed, according to Barrasso’s presentation. 
SMRs are a “convenient” discussion for people resistant to renewable energy development, Watters said in an interview. “The interest is being driven by people who think SMRs are the answer to every problem in the world,” he said. But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.
Other technologies, including forms of renewable energy, are deployable now and could be implemented with less investment, said Dan Weeks, of solar developer ReVision Energy, at the summit. Weeks highlighted grid-scale batteries and renewable generation as other options that the state could direct attention to rather than the hypothetical future deployment of SMRs.
“Is the (Department of Energy) thinking about meeting these rising energy needs and cost concerns through … greater deployment of existing technologies that are at this point pretty far down the cost curve and probably a lot closer in the future than SMRs?” Weeks asked.
“My job was to sort of get ‘all of the above’ into the mindset of everyone,” Barrasso responded.
The Legislature has already taken some steps toward localized power generation that could be used to power facilities like data centers through SMRs. House Bill 672, sponsored by Vose and signed by Gov. Ayotte in August, paved the way for off-grid energy generators to sell power directly to buyers. Vose said he hoped that bill would “encourage” microgrids. (The bill also exempts off-grid electricity providers from renewable energy standards and the rate regulations on-grid generation is subject to.)
A resolution to declare the development of advanced nuclear technology “in the best interest of New Hampshire” also passed last session, but legislators failed to pass House Bill 710, which would have allowed utilities to own and operate SMRs. A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Kevin Avard will come before the Legislature in 2026, according to a legislative service request listed on the General Court of New Hampshire website.
McGahey acknowledged the push to build data centers quickly had led developers to look toward more quickly deployable energy solutions than SMRs. In other states, developers have constructed new gas generators to meet data center demand, he said. 
“Because this race is so intense, we’re looking for solutions in two to three years. We are looking at battery storage solutions. We’re looking at natural gas plants,” McGahey said.
Looking ahead
During his presentation, McGahey forecasted demand for a wave of smaller data centers within the next three to five years. The appetite of New Hampshire policymakers and utilities toward that development, McGahey said, could play a role in determining to what extent that development progresses locally.
The reality that New Hampshire’s grid is facing, including difficulties from power shortages and aging transmission lines, may make it unlikely that the state ever sees data center development on a large scale, Watters said. 
“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’d be an interest in siting them here,” he said. 
But the possibility, and related concerns, were worth discussing, he said, and others at the summit agreed.
“We need to get people to the table to start to talk about what the future is going to look like,” Barrasso said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor/States Newsroom.)The Ohio Supreme Court is considering the case of an Allen County man named Patrick Heffley who says he should be able to purchase firearms again, despite several domestic violence convictions.
A lower court said no, he couldn’t, but Ohio’s Third District Court of Appeals disagreed. State prosecutors appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, insisting Heffley remains under weapons disability, and is thus barred from possessing firearms.
Federal statute generally prohibits a person with a misdemeanor or felony domestic violence conviction from having a gun. It provides, however, a handful of exceptions including the state restoration of the person’s civil rights. But under Ohio statute, restoration of civil rights hinges on an individual not being “otherwise prohibited by law” from having a firearm.
“Isn’t he caught between a rock and a hard place?” Justice Pat Fischer asked.
Assistant Allen County Prosecuting Attorney John Willamowksi readily acknowledged Heffley’s in a bind.
“It is effectively one statute saying (to) the state, you go first,” he said, “and the state statute saying federal disability, you be removed (first).”
Still, Willamowski argued state law is “plain and unambiguous.” Until Heffley’s federal weapons disability is gone, he can’t have his state civil rights restored. And until his state civil rights are restored, his federal weapons disability can’t be removed.
Background
Beginning in 2000, Heffley was convicted of a string of domestic violence offenses, including one fourth degree felony in 2006. Heffley served his sentence, paid his fines and court costs and made it through parole without incident. Since his release, Heffley told the trial court, his only contact with law enforcement was getting pulled over for a seatbelt violation.
Under federal law, a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction is enough to lose gun rights and so is a “crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” Heffley was sentenced to 12 months for his felony, but the offense is punishable by up to 18 months behind bars.
In its arguments, the state leans on that felony conviction as the weapons disability keeping Heffley from getting a gun. In response, Heffley’s legal team points to a statement of legislative intent included as uncodified language in 2011’s House Bill 54.
The provision states, in no uncertain terms, that “The General Assembly is explicitly making this amendment to clarify that relief from a weapons disability (…) restores a person’s civil firearm rights to such an extent that the uniform federal ban on possessing any firearms at all (…) does not apply to that person.”
But the state dismissed that legislative language. The same section was subsequently amended — without the intent language — raising the question of whether the earlier, uncodified provision actually speaks to the current statute.
Oral arguments
More fundamentally, Heffley’s attorney Andrea Henning contends the state is misreading that “otherwise prohibited by law” provision in the underlying statute.
“Otherwise does not refer to the existence of the federal disability,” she told the justices. “It would refer to having a source other than what you’re seeking relief under.”
From Henning’s point of view, Heffley might be barred from relief if there was some other offense, but his state and federal weapons disability are fundamentally the same thing. Ohio’s courts can’t separate them for the purpose of legal analysis.
She said pitting the state and federal disabilities against one another, as the state suggests, would mean there’s Ohioans in Heffley’s shoes have little chance of ever restoring their gun rights.
“Despite,” Henning reminded them, “the legislature determining that they are worthy of an avenue to ask the court to consider granting this relief.”
Henning’s arguments resonated with some Republican members on the bench. Justices Pat Fischer and Pat DeWine pressed Willamowksi to explain away the uncodified section lawmakers approved in 2011.
“Do you think the result that you’re advocating today is what The General Assembly intended when they passed the statute?” DeWine asked. “I know the statute may say something different, but do you think that this is what they intended? That there is no way to get relief for this? That they’re in this Catch-22 circle?”
Even blunter, Fischer asked, “Why have an uncodified section? What was the point?”
Willamowski said it doesn’t really matter what lawmakers wanted — it matters what they wrote. If the General Assembly isn’t happy with the outcome, he said, they’ve got all the authority they need to change the law anytime they wish.
What’s more, Willamowski said, Heffley isn’t actually stuck in some Kafkaesque maze of contradictory laws. It might be a longshot, but he can seek a pardon or apply through the federal courts to rescind his weapons disability.
“You can apply to the United States Attorney General for relief from that federal firearms disability,” he said. “Whether individuals are regularly granted that or not, is something for the legislature to decide when they are crafting their statute here.”
And while Henning contends the state’s reading would set aside lawmakers’ stated intent, Willamowski argued the one Heffley and the appeals court favor, would create an even more “illogical” outcome.
Existing Ohio precedent holds state courts can’t remove a firearms disability that doesn’t stem from a state violation. Because federal law considers misdemeanor domestic violence grounds for weapons disability, while Ohio law does not, state courts can’t restore the gun rights of a person with a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.
“If it is interpreted as the Third District (Appeals Court) is asking it to be, it would create an instance where it would almost incentivize individuals,” Willamowski said. “If you have a felony offense in that circumstance you could get your firearm rights back, where in the misdemeanor circumstance you couldn’t do so.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230211gunOrama03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 04:56:14.445266

Calderwood spent the summer continuing a multi-year research project that looks at the benefits of applying mulch to wild blueberry fields. She’s been studying how the thickness of the mulch affects soil moisture and pest management. 
Her work has revealed a sweet spot with 1 to 1.5 inches of mulch that she has learned could even buffer the impact from early stages of droughts. But mulching would not have staved off the harm done by the dry conditions farmers saw this year. 
“Once you get to severe drought that we saw this August, it can’t replace irrigation,” she said. 
Although farmers and growers have historically been able to rely on even rainfall throughout the growing season in Maine, the agricultural community has been forced to deal with more moisture extremes. The 2020 growing season marked the driest in state history, while the wettest growing season on record came just three years later. 
In light of uncertain federal support, Common Ground Fair takes on added importance for farmers

Coping with these conditions has become a challenge for farms whose income hinges on precipitation levels and could even have larger economic effects as wild blueberries alone contribute more than $350 million annually to the state economy. Many farmers don’t have the money or expertise to plan and install irrigation infrastructure on their land, so they are hoping state support can fill those gaps. 
This particularly dry summer just so happened to coincide with the launch of a new drought relief fund that the state set up to assist farmers with the financial and technical aspects of adding irrigation systems. The program is in its nascent stages as the first round of projects were approved earlier this year. Those grants will help a couple dozen farms, but some experts worry the fund and other existing programs won’t be enough to meet the growing need. 
A “flash drought”
Prior to June, there weren’t any concerns of a drought this summer. 
The state had just come off more than a dozen rainy weekends in a row in the spring and there was decent rainfall at the end of the month. However, that changed in mid- to late-July as the state saw long stretches of little to no rain. 
“After July 21, this is when conditions started to deteriorate,” said Sean Birkel, the state climatologist and an assistant professor at the University of Maine. 
With virtually no rainfall for the second half July and the first half of August, conditions worsened. Harvesters were out in the fields in the first week of August picking plump blueberries from the stem, Calderwood said, but she remembers hearing conversations among growers about how dry it was getting. Those who had irrigation either already had it on or remarked that they should turn it on because wild blueberries require about one inch of water per week.
But it was the three-day heatwave from August 11-13 that pushed the prolonged precipitation deficit over the edge. On August 14, the National Weather Services announced a “flash drought” in parts of Maine and New Hampshire. From the fields, Calderwood said, “that is really what it felt like to a lot of farmers.” 
The plants started to turn brown and crispy. Normally the plants bounce back up as you walk through the fields, but Calderwood described how instead they crunched under their feet. Blueberries were shriveling up and even dropping to the ground. 
Thanks to the genetic diversity of Maine’s wild blueberries, some varieties are more drought resistant than others, which allowed some plants to maintain their luster. 
Birkel said a precise definition for flash drought is still debated and there are questions about the phenomenon, but this recent event gives more reason to better understand how they work.
Birkel said more analysis is needed to know how that stretch of drought compares historically, but Calderwood said it was the quickest onset of a drought she’s seen in her seven seasons. Her colleagues who have been doing this work for three decades told her the same.
Short term drought is relatively common in Maine and the northeast, Birkel said, but it’s unclear if events like the summer of 2020 or this past August will become more common or whether the state will experience fewer droughts in the future. What the data is showing is a trend toward more extremes — drier dry periods and wetter wet periods — Birkel said.  
Since mid-August, dry conditions in the northeast region have worsened with severe drought spreading from coastal Maine westward into the central part of the state, according to a Sept. 11 update from the National Integrated Drought Information System.

State relief fund
After the historic 2020 drought, Rachel Schattman, an assistant professor of sustainable agriculture at the University of Maine School of Food and Agriculture, worked with a group from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to survey the agricultural community about how they coped with the conditions. They learned that farmers need more help accessing water, Schattman said. 
She found that farmers and growers in Maine feel vulnerable to drought and see it taking a toll on their production. And although they are “starting to see irrigation as part of the cost of doing business,” they are underinvested in the necessary equipment and supplies because they haven’t needed it historically, Schattman said. 
As that research was unfolding, the state crafted a program to provide farmers with the financial and technical resources they said they need to mitigate droughts. 
The Farmers Drought Relief Fund was created by the Maine Legislature in 2021 with $1 million in startup funding and an annual appropriation of $300,000. With this fund, farmers can apply for $7,500 grants to pay for conservation planners to create water management plans or they can submit plans for specific projects such as water storage ponds or various types of wells. 
However, because of the slew of rainy Saturdays this spring, dry conditions weren’t top of mind for farmers when the state put out its first request for applications in April. Farmers were busy preparing their fields for the summer season, so the department only received 28 applications, 24 of which were funded, said Tom Gordon, a soil and water conservation program coordinator.
“Now, drought is at the forefront of farmers’ minds, and with the first round of funding out the door, we expect to have a lot of interest in applications for our second round of funding,” Gordon said, which will be announced in early 2026.
Among the successful applications, the department will fund 10 water management plans. Gordon said recent declines in federal appropriations and staffing for these services means there are actually “relatively few” conservation planners in Maine who can assist farmers. However, he said the department hopes to build this capacity in the future.
The department also funded four water storage ponds and 10 drilled wells for farms ranging in size from one to 1,100 acres. Most of them grow mixed vegetables, but some potato and wild blueberry operations also received funding. 
A “drop in the bucket” 
While Eric Venturini, executive director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine, said his organization is glad for the state relief fund and thinks it has real potential to help farmers, it’s “a drop in the bucket of what’s truly needed.”
Venturini was disappointed that applications for the first round opened up during a busy time of year for farmers and growers, but beyond that he said the Legislature can further help Maine’s agricultural industries by providing more sources of ongoing funding that deliver capital directly to farms. 
The wild blueberry industry is made up of more than 500 different farms that generate $361 million to the state’s economy annually. Venturini said that number only takes into account out-of-state fruit sales that bring money back to the state and doesn’t include in-state sales.

The hundreds of wild blueberry operations in Maine vary in size, so Venturini said some businesses have been able to modernize with technology that allows them to take on challenges like droughts. Others are more bogged down by thin profit-margins and costly conditions that not only require new, expensive infrastructure, but diminish the crop that feeds their bottom line. 
Last October, the commission received word that it would be awarded a $15.5 million federal grant that would flow to farmers to develop water sources, Venturini said. However, he also said it never came to fruition due to changes from the Trump administration, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced legislation (LD 1140) for a $45 million bond to support the state’s agricultural, food and forest product economy. 
Most of the bond would be used to invest in forest products and the dairy sector, but $2.5 million of it would be earmarked for disaster relief. That slice of money would be “very, very important” given the historic droughts the state has seen recently, Daughtry said when introducing the bill to the Legislature’s budget committee. 
The proposed bond was carried over to the next legislative session, which will begin in January. However, even if it is supported by lawmakers, it would need to go to voters through a statewide referendum for final approval. The soonest voters could take up the issue would be November 2026.
With many personal ties to the agriculture community, including her mother who ran a wild blueberry field, Daughtry reiterated to Maine Morning Star that investing in farms is particularly critical in light of the changing climate and federal funding cuts. She said it was a priority even before this summer, but the drought underscored the need for rural resilience. 
Daughtry said she appreciates that bond proposals are “one of the only times that Maine people get a direct say.” She plans to continue being a strong advocate for the proposal because it could be a “game-changing investment” for farms.
“When a bond goes on a ballot, voters are able to vote on their values and really decide whether they want to support agriculture or disaster relief or transportation,” she said.
Daughtry said the Legislature will have the chance to reevaluate the bill to determine if the proposal would be enough to address what farmers are facing. 
“The drought this summer has shown that Maine farms of all types need help ensuring their businesses can stay viable and resilient in the face of increasingly unpredictable weather conditions,” said Shelley Megquier, policy and research director for Maine Farmland Trust, who also testified in support of LD 1140. 
“Maine has established programs, such as the Farmers Drought Relief Fund, to support farmers through dry summers like this one but they need to be robustly funded and effectively implemented to have real impact.”
Beyond that, Megquier told Maine Morning Star that Maine farmers need more flexible funding they can access quickly and easily in the face of climate disasters or seasons like this summer that brought about crop loss.

Yet the state’s economy continues to lag behind the national average, a report released earlier this month says.
In all, Ohio has 177 tax exemptions or deductions worth $20 million a year or more. In its last session, the General Assembly limited or eliminated nine, but it increased the cost of others, the report by Policy Matters Ohio said. 
Tax breaks on certain people and businesses are effectively tax increases on everybody else. That’s so because government services have to be paid for, and those who remain on the tax rolls have to bear the burden.
“Unproductive tax breaks that favor corporations and wealthy Ohioans have riddled the state tax code for years,” the report said. 
At more than $8 billion a year, the state’s biggest cuts are those to businesses. 
The biggest single tax break — costing $2.5 billion a year — primarily targets supplies to manufacturers in an attempt to avoid taxing them repeatedly through the process. 
The state seems to have something to show for it. Ohio has the third-most manufacturing jobs in the U.S., and the sixth-most per 100,000 residents. 
However, other such tax breaks have long raised questions. One is the LLC tax break, which costs nearly $1 billion a year. Sold in 2013 as a way to spur job creation, it greatly limits taxes on income run through limited liability companies. 
“Wealthy individuals benefit most from the LLC loophole,” the Policy Matters report said. “In (fiscal year) 2023, a majority of filers claiming the deduction claimed less than $20,000 and received 6.9% of the total value of such deductions. Meanwhile, the 8.3% of filers who claimed $240,000 or more received 41.1% of the deductions.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe state has given up billions in revenue on that deduction and paying for the private agency JobsOhio on promises they would supercharge the job market to everyone’s benefit. But more than 25% of Ohioans are poor enough to be on Medicaid, and the state has consistently ranked in the top 10 in unemployment this year. 
Ohio also lags in a broader economic sense. Last year it ranked 28th in terms of per-capita gross domestic product.
That might mean that other business breaks also aren’t helping most Ohioans.
Unlike most states, Ohio has no tax on corporate profits. It taxes gross receipts under its “Commercial Activity Tax” instead.
In 2023, the legislature raised the threshold at which companies had to start paying it from $1 million a year to $6 million, and it eliminated certain minimum payments. Since most businesses were already paying the minimum $150 a year, more than half the benefit of the higher threshold went to businesses large enough to take in more than $6 million annually.
That tax break costs the state $1.5 billion a year, the Policy Matters report said. The increased thresholds will grow the fastest of any over the next two years, it added.
The report also faulted Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing a measure in the state budget that would have stopped new data centers from getting tax exemptions. Such centers employ few people, and they’re being blamed for rapid increases in Ohioans’ electricity bills.
“The sales tax exemption for data centers, one of the state’s fast-growing tax breaks, will be worth $289.9 million over the FY 2026-27 biennium, according to the Tax Expenditure Report, and probably a lot more if more recently announced investments were included,” JobsOhio researchers wrote. “In many cases, the exemption amounts to as much as $1 million for each data-center job created.”
The tax breaks persist even as lawmakers plead poverty when it comes to funding public education. Abandoning an earlier commitment to pony up at least $666 million more for education over the next two years, the budget DeWine signed slashed that amount by about two-thirds. Meanwhile, the legislature found $600 million to help the billionaire owners of the Cleveland Browns build a new stadium outside the city.
The Policy Matters Ohio report said the legislature opted to look past evidence that some tax breaks weren’t performing as promised. In 2016, the General Assembly passed a bipartisan bill to create a Tax Expenditure Review Committee.
“However, lawmakers found living up to the promise of good government harder than anticipated,” the report said. “They eliminated the (review committee) in the 2022-23 budget bill, after a weak review of 15 sales-tax breaks and failing to carry out its mandates at all in the 2020-21 budget period.”
That and other factors mean that once tax breaks are signed into law, reform is “excruciatingly difficult,” the report said.

The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.
But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.


So says a new survey of likely voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states in the severely backlogged PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.


Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.


And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are ​“very concerned.”


“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the National Conservative Energy Summit in Cleveland on Aug. 25.


He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.


 Adding more ​“lanes” to the grid

Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.


But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more ​“lanes” in the form of added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCurrently, ​“there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.


While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”


Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”


But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.


The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.


 What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.


“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.


The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.


Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.


Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.


Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.


Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.


Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.
With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Here’s one guarantee from Kansas Reflector: We’re not soaked in drugs and sent through the mail.
That’s the curious claim made by the state Department of Corrections after it decided to cancel all print newspaper subscriptions purchased for inmates by outside parties. That’s right — state officials believe that your hometown gazette is at risk of being infused in a mind-altering substance and carried by the Postal Service. Publishers and the Kansas Press Association have protested mightily, but the department has refused to offer any specifics about the supposed threat.
As I said, a good reason to turn to the all-digital Kansas Reflector. The only mind-altering substance we’re infused with is great reporting and community commentary. If you really want to taint us with drugs in some way, I suppose you can print out some of our stories and do so in the privacy of your own home.
If it sounds like I’m not taking these stories from the state seriously, that’s because I’m not.
Kansas Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski wrote about the change Sept. 8: “Previously, families of incarcerated people could take out a newspaper subscription in a person’s name and have it delivered to a state facility. The agency says it made the change, forbidding newspaper subscriptions paid for by outside parties, for safety. … The new policy requires people serving time in state facilities to request a subscription on their own, undergo an approval process and pay for the subscription out of their commissary accounts.”
After that initial story was published, prison spokesman David Thompson wrote in an email to Kaminski: “The impetus for this policy is an increase in drug-soaked material, such as books and newspapers, being transmitted to residents through the USPS.”
The department provided no evidence that this had happened in Kansas.
Let’s consider for a moment what it would mean for newspapers to actually pose such a threat. What is the corrections department actually suggesting? It seems to me one of two astonishingly improbable scenarios.
First off, it suspects that a newspaper publisher somewhere in the Sunflower State actually has been coating his or her publication with drugs and sending it through the mail. It’s already tough enough making ends meet in this business. Why would owners and operators of local papers open themselves up to such threats?
Secondly, they think that the mail has somehow been intercepted along its path from publisher to prison. That would be a federal crime. And while I understand that legal ramifications don’t deter everyone, surely these canny drug smugglers would want to spread drugs on more durable paper than newsprint. Have you ever tried to even wrap a mug in newspaper? It’s not that durable!
The final and wildest part of all this is that the actual restriction doesn’t fit the supposed risk.
Kansas has forbidden friends and family from buying inmates newspaper subscriptions. But inmates themselves can still purchase the subscriptions. So if the infrastructure already exists to ship newspapers-as-drugs into prisons, the only thing that needs to change is the person actually buying the subscription (and perhaps the prison’s approval process, however that works).
Here’s the bottom line. Prisons and those who run them want control over their institutions and inmates. Contact with the outside world — be it mail, visits or internet — poses potential risks to inmate and staff safety. Officials want to lower those potential risks.
That makes sense. But it can lead to ridiculous situations like this one, where the action taken doesn’t lead to the stated goals and make no sense besides.
Believe me, we wanted to hear more from the state about this. Kaminski and others at Kansas Reflector and the Kansas Press Association have sought extra information and explanations. We would be happy to understand more about officials’ thinking and share it with our readers. Perhaps my absurd scenarios aren’t so absurd after all.
But they have refused to do so. We’re left with a ham-fisted restriction on the free access to information. That leaves all of us, not just prisoners, worse off.

(Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Amid the recent roiling seas of public murder and on-purpose mayhem came the news that film star Robert Redford had died at 89. As one among millions who enjoyed his movies — whether acting or directing — I have always been especially struck by Redford’s persona … his off-screen character.
Or, more to the point, struck by the contrast between his persona and what we see too much these days on multiple screens.
A caution: Drawing conclusions about actors can be tricky. Their storytelling universe depends on make believe. That reality, however, should neither diminish the message of their films nor paint thespians and the stories they tell with a broad brush, regardless of genre.
Still, exploring Redford’s life, what he valued and with whom he surrounded himself, reveals a fairly clear picture. Of particular interest were the observations of those closest to him both inside and outside the movie business. 
What emerged off the screen, without the patina and greasepaint of such legendary characters as Roy Hobbs and Butch Cassidy, the notoriety of Bob Woodward or his many other memorable roles in a lengthy career, was an intelligent, passionate, unassuming and polite grownup. 
So the news that he had passed gave me pause for more than the loss of a gifted artist with a long and distinguished body of work. We coulduse more examples of his quiet, powerful persona. In a field where success is often measured by the size and duration of the spotlight, he seemed to neither seek nor relish its glow, which is antithetical to a world where likes, retweets and influencers are commodities by which we calculate importance.    
That said, Redford was no modern Marlboro Man or a fence-riding desperado avoiding the public. He was, after all, an actor, whose work is consumed by the public — making him a public figure. Yet, when he could afford to leave the concrete and cacophony of Hollywood, he made Utah his home, far from the freeways and frenzy of his native Southern California. 
Nor was he reclusive … or silent. Instead, in addition to his professional life and his establishing of the Sundance Institute for independent filmmakers, Redford chose social activism, especially environmental causes, issues facing Indigenous people and the plight of the LGBTQ+ community. 
Redford led successful campaigns against a power plant in Utah and a six-lane highway that would have spoiled a canyon area near his home. He lobbied Congress to pass the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. At the time of his death, he had been a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council for over 50 years.
The upheaval and angst of the last couple weeks are at once disheartening and instructive. We watched as screaming, yelling and blaming have continued apace about everything from secret files to murderous motives to unhinged hatred. We learned that constitutionally protected speech apparently ends before late-night television begins. 
Many have gasped when experts — you remember experts, those in a particular field with advanced educations, considerable experience and the respect of their peers — reported that public health decisions were being based on poor science or worse, none. We stared in disbelief as some leaders argued for  governmental stamps of approval on thought and speech.
The result is undeniable. Many of the world’s rounded corners have become sharp, unforgiving to those who bump against them. As we approach 250 years as a nation, nearly six in ten Americans hold pessimistic views of the future, according to data from the Pew Research Center. 
When a general unease about tomorrow is afoot, you can never have too many real adults in the room. Redford’s passing means one fewer.
He once said, “… in keeping diversity alive, it will help keep our industry alive. To be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us as artists to tell our stories in our own way about the human condition, the complexities of life, the world around us, is a gift, and not one to be taken lightly.”
He spoke those words in 2002, when the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences awarded him an Honorary Oscar for prompting and supporting independent filmmaking. Their metaphorical underpinning, however, defies today’s frightening move away from diversified thought and expression and toward some monolithic political viewpoint. 
Robert Redford was a movie star. Perhaps his brightest light, however, illuminated and embraced his defense of art, the environment and the freedom to express one’s self and — especially — his character in doing so.

Usually, politicians will bloviate during campaigns about all the wonderful, transformative things they’ll do if voted into office. Most fall far short of their promises; others use smoke-and-mirrors or sleight-of-hand to distract the public from their shortcomings.
But in Donald Trump’s case, in the early days of his second term, he has used a raft of executive orders, staffing shifts, and slashed budgets to disassemble parts of the federal government, including entire agencies. He has concentrated on significantly reducing the federal workforce and deleting regulatory agencies.
He has been making good on his vow to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. Even before he assumed office, Trump and a coterie of far-right billionaires, bigots, kooks, and shadowy entities began building the framework to make this nightmare real.
Gov. Ron DeSantis built one concentration camp deep in the Florida Everglades and just opened another at the closed Baker Correctional Institution. It now holds 117 people but has the capacity to hold 1,500, according to DeSantis administration officials. The site is about 45 miles west of Jacksonville near the Osceola National Forest.
CNN says DeSantis is “doubling down” on his plans to build a third detention site in Florida’s Panhandle, which he has dubbed “Panhandle Pokey,” along with another facility at a Florida National Guard training center known as Camp Blanding, about 30 miles southwest of Jacksonville.
Other states are jumping on the bandwagon with other proposed immigration facilities, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer” and Louisiana’s “Camp 57,” located at Angola Prison farm, an 18,000-acre plantation sitting an hour north of Baton Rouge.
Trump and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller have successfully linked immigration with crime and we are watching dragnets in Florida cities and across the country with untold numbers of undocumented and legal immigrants being swept up.
But Trump couldn’t do this alone. Much like Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, or Leopold II of Belgium, a whole bunch of people need to sign onto your vision and they must be willing to build the legal, ideological, and logistical infrastructure needed to pull this off.
That’s where Ron DeSantis comes in. On this issue, DeSantis is an eager underling, working since June in concert with the Trump administration. He, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and others have embarked on an unprincipled, sadistic crusade of indiscriminately disappearing, imprisoning, and deporting Latino, Black, and Brown immigrants.
The Trump and DeSantis administrations lacked legal authority to do what they’ve been doing, but they have bent laws and ignored precedent and norms to trample on immigrants’ rights.
Domination
It becomes clearer by the day that the imposition of white domination, power, and control of the state and the country animates everything DeSantis and Trump are doing.
DeSantis has fervently signed on to the MAGA Republican white nationalist project of dragging the United States back to a time when European Americans ruled the roost using brute force; murder; laws, customs and norms; and terrorism and fear to intimidate and control African Americans.
Florida has served as the petri dish for DeSantis and his enablers to roll out the far-right agenda and gauge the public response or acceptance of these policies. Whether it’s banning books, laws seeking to curb or erase gay and trans individuals, anti-Black and anti-DEI bias, whitewashing facts, rewriting history, and attacking African Americans and other marginalized groups.
We are witnessing American apartheid, with the use of a range of mechanisms to more fully marginalize those who DeSantis and Trump deem “the other.” As the ACLU reminds us, DeSantis has joined Trump in amplifying already strained racial tensions in the United States. Both have been brazen in their overt quest to weaponize anger, resentment, and racial grievance.
Political content producer Danielle Moodie notes that Trump, Brett Kavanaugh, and a white nationalist Supreme Court are dismantling democracy, civil rights, and America’s economy.
“Isn’t it remarkable how the Supreme Court can rule in one breath that race cannot be considered in college admissions — stripping away affirmative action — and in the next, empower ICE to racially profile, detain, and harass Latinos simply for speaking Spanish in Los Angeles?” Moodie asks. “This hypocrisy reveals a troubling truth: The Court claims to be color-blind when protecting opportunity, yet suddenly sees race when it comes to criminalization, detention, and fear.”
Moodie added: “This contradiction is not just a legal nuance. It is a reflection of how deeply embedded white supremacy remains within our institutions. And under Donald Trump’s leadership, aided by his handpicked justices, the Supreme Court has become less an arbiter of justice and more an enabler of authoritarianism.”
The immediate result: Immigrants — documented and undocumented — are being disappeared by ICE agents without reasonable suspicion. The far-right faction is allowing federal and state law enforcement agents to confront and detain anyone who looks Latino, speaks little or no English, and gathers in certain places where Latinos congregate.
This blessing granted by the high court of racial profiling allows gangs of ICE, Border Patrol, Homeland Security, ATF, and others to hunt down immigrants, the vast majority of whom have committed no crime.
Moodie notes that the Supreme Court, its credibility at an all-time low, stripped away affirmative action in higher education; handed presidential immunity to Donald Trump while he faced multiple indictments; and enabled a wave of anti-immigrant policies that echo the darkest chapters of American history.
“Chief Justice John Roberts will likely be remembered not as a guardian of the Constitution, but as the leader who rolled back a century of progress on civil rights,” she said.
Theatrics
Critics including James Greenberg, emeritus professor of anthropology at The University of Arizona, have been warning about the authoritarian path that DeSantis and MAGA Republicans elsewhere are laying out. They mean to stoke fear and compel compliance.
“These theatrics work like rituals. Military vehicles rumble through desert towns, children in cages, recruitment ads with warriors silhouetted against flags  — all ceremonies of fear,” Greenberg said. “They draw sharp lines of belonging and exclusion, marking who belongs and who is cast out. Raids at dawn, walls built for cameras, soldiers posing for photo ops are repeated gestures that turn cruelty into liturgy, weaving it into civic life until it looks ordinary.”
“Power has left marks on the land and surveillance has become a terrain of expansion,” Greenberg added.
“Tools once built to track foreign terrorists now target immigrants, activists, journalists, even civil servants. Private tech firms fused with federal agencies, creating databases that sweep up social media posts, license plate scans, phone metadata, and travel patterns,” he said. “These systems persist without oversight. Algorithms flag ‘suspicious behavior’ that often means nothing more than speaking out, worshiping differently, or crossing paths with the wrong people.”
Those who resist are surveilled by drones, have their phones and laptops searched at airports and border crossings.
“The effect is not only to collect data but to intimidate, to show people they are always visible. Surveillance has become a system of control, a constant warning that belonging can be questioned at any time,” said Greenberg.
“Detention has followed the same logic. Private prison companies, once in retreat, under Trump found new life. Contracts multiplied, decommissioned facilities reopened, tent cities sprouted in remote deserts. These sites were deliberately hard to reach, far from lawyers and reporters. Images of overcrowded cells and children behind fences remain etched in memory as proof of how cruelty is normalized.”
In total, detention “has always been as much spectacle as policy, a ritual of exclusion designed to instill fear before it processes anyone,” he continued.
“Inside, migrants are fingerprinted, DNA-tested, and placed in systems that reduce human beings to biometric codes. What looks like confinement is both political theater and an extraction of data and profits,” Greenberg said.
“Family separation reveals the cruelty in its starkest form. Parents deported without their children. By severing the most basic bonds of belonging, the state redefined what it means to be part of the nation. Citizenship papers could not shield children from being rendered effectively stateless if their parents were removed. Belonging is treated as a privilege that can be revoked at will.”
The deeper truth, Greenberg warns, is that repression relies on infrastructure.
“Prisons, surveillance grids, militarized zones — once built, rarely vanish. They remain in place for whoever comes next,” he said. “Like irrigation canals dug centuries ago, they channel flows of power long after their builders are gone. Trump accelerated this process, turning the latent into the active, the possible into the real.”
Depending on who you ask, there are those who believe that it’s already too late to reverse what DeSantis, Trump, the orchestrators of Project 2025, and MAGA Republicans are doing, while others believe America still has time.
Regardless of where you stand, what are we prepared to do to dismantle this architecture of tyranny?

On his show last week, Kimmel said that Trump’s supporters were “desperately trying” to paint Tyler Robinson (the alleged assassin) “as anything other than one of them.”
Anyone who follows the news and monitors social media will conclude that Kimmel’s statement was largely accurate. Indeed, many in the Trump administration including the vice president went out of their way to suggest that a radical network of left-wing extremists was behind the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk even as this claim stood in contrast to the evidence presented by law enforcement.
ABC’s suspension of the Jimmy Kimmel show came right after Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission chairman, threatened in an interview that he would consider punishing the local stations that carried Kimmel’s show. Carr’s comments were swiftly followed by announcements from several stations with ABC affiliates that they would move to cancel Kimmel’s show.
In the wake of the Charlie Kirk murder, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested that the Justice Department would target groups and individuals that were employing hate speech. When reporters pointed out to Bondi that hate speech is generally protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, she seemed to walk back some of her initial comments. Nonetheless, by then the Trump Administration’s threatening message was resonating.
The canceling of the Jimmy Kimmel show is nothing less than a cynical attack on one of the most sacred liberties in a democracy—the freedom of speech and expression. Trump applauded this canceling in a tweet, ironically negating his own remarks from the second inaugural address in January 2025 when he vowed to “immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.”

An excerpt from President Donald Trump’s January 20 inaugural address.
Yet even more troubling than the attack on free speech by the Trump administration is the culture of fear and intimidation that they have created since coming into office nine months ago. Earlier this week, President Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House. The lawsuit focuses on a book about Trump by two New York Times reporters and three “false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging” articles that he says were aimed at sabotaging his chances in the 2024 presidential election.
The suit was dismissed last Friday by a federal court judge, but a report by PBS observes that “Trump has filed lawsuits against outlets whose coverage he dislikes, threatened to revoke TV broadcast licenses and sought to bend news organizations and social media companies to his will.” Such tactics are akin to those used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and are aimed at chipping away at political freedoms and independent media while consolidating power.
An independent media is not the only institution that has been targeted by the second Trump administration. Upon assuming office in January, one of the first actions of this administration was to withhold research funding and exert tremendous political pressures on major universities like Columbia and Harvard.
Columbia, the first to capitulate to the demands of the Trump Administration, agreed in March to overhaul its protest policies, security practices and Middle Eastern studies department. In the case of Harvard, the government insisted that it change hiring and admissions in departments that “lack viewpoint diversity” and “immediately shutter” any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. Even if one agrees with some of the demands of the Trump Administration, the tactics they are using to secure compliance are not consistent with dialogue and negotiation, which is how healthy democratic societies pursue change.
We should also remember the executive order signed by Trump, which targeted prestigious law firms like Paul Weiss for conducting work or hiring lawyers that the White House disfavors. Weiss ultimately reached a deal with the administration that enabled the firm to get out from the penalties imposed by the order. According to an article in Politico, “eight firms followed that precedent in order to avoid becoming targeted themselves, ultimately committing a combined total of nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal services to largely unspecified initiatives supported by the Trump administration.”
Taken together, the actions of the Trump Administration amount to much more than bullying a network to cancel a late-night talk show or censoring the negative coverage that the President is receiving. What is at stake here is a concerted effort to establish a culture of fear and intimidation, one in which media organizations, non-profits, and ordinary citizens must think twice about critiquing and challenging the government.
 As we approach the 250th anniversary of the American experiment in democracy, we should remember that our founders called on us to vigorously resist any efforts to curtail our fundamental rights and liberties.

A single historical example or a set number of victims does not define genocide. Instead, “Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent” –inferred or explicit- “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:

Killing members of the group;
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”

Braffman’s effort to minimize Israel’s crimes finds no support in fact or law. But don’t take our word for it, listen to world experts.  Early on in Israel’s assault on Gaza, more than 800 scholars and practitioners of international law and genocide studies signed a public statement “to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.” Such concern arose not only from Israel’s ruthless bombing of civilians but from the many statements of genocidal intent spewing from Israeli leaders. 
The International Court of Justice’s interim ruling in January 2024 ordered Israel to prevent genocide, punish incitement to genocide, and enable provisions of basic services and humanitarian assistance to reach Gaza. In March 2024, the ICJ further ordered Israel to stop the invasion of Rafah and to reopen the Rafah crossing to humanitarian aid deliveries. But Israel ignored these provisional measures.
Amnesty International issued a report in December 2024 that “Israel has carried out acts prohibited under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza.” Likewise, Human Rights Watch concluded that “Israeli authorities” were “responsible for the crime against humanity of extermination and for acts of genocide. Professor Omar Bartov, who had previously served in the Israeli Defense Force, reached the “inescapable conclusion” in July 2025 that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. In July, B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization recognized that “the Israeli regime is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.” 
The International Association of Genocide Scholars declared  on August 31, 2025, that “Israel’s policies and actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide.” On September 16, the United Nations’ Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory published a report that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since October 17, 2023.
Each day, Israel starves Palestinian children and murders and maims more civilians with the Trump administration’s support. On September 18, the U.S. cast its sixth veto on a U.N. Security Council resolution concerning a Gaza ceasefire. A report issued by Brown University’s Cost of War Project estimates that in the one year ending September 30, 2024, the U.S. government provided $22.76 billion in military-related aid to Israel. 
Just before leaving office, the Biden administration notified Congress of additional munitions sales totaling $8 billion that the Trump administration subsequently approved. In February 2025, the State Department approved $6.75 billion in munitions sales, including 500-pound bombs. A missile sales package, valued at $660 million, was also approved in February 2025. In July 2025, the State Department approved $510 million sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions.
As of September 2025, the confirmed death toll in Gaza surpassed 65,000, including more than 20,000 children and 1,000 babies under one year old.  Even though 84% of the American electorate favors an immediate ceasefire, Congress, in contravention of the Leahy Law, continues its unconditional support for Israel.  
Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut joined with Republicans in July in opposing the Joint Resolutions of Disapproval that would limit certain weapons to Israel, supported by 27 senators, including Sen. Chris Murphy. Thus far, U.S. Reps. John Larson, Joe Courtney, Rosa DeLauro, Jim Himes, and Jahana Hayes have refused to unite with 49 congressional Democrats to co-sponsor H.R. 3565 to ban weapons to Israel. 
We guess that Elaine Braffman is quite happy with that result. But as for us, and most of the Connecticut electorate, we do not want our government and tax dollars supporting Israel’s Gaza genocide.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-22 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"After Bridgeport, why no ballot reform?",Peter A. Thalheim,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/22/no-legislative-fix-for-bridgeports-absentee-ballot-scandal/,Our Democratic Party of Connecticut has been benefiting from a corrupt Bridgeport balloting for decades which is why election reform is unlikely.,"Andrew Brown of the Connecticut Mirror posed a poignant question in his June 26 piece reporting that Bridgeport elections scandals fail to inspire new laws. 
How is it that with “seven political operatives, campaign workers and elected officials currently facing charges for allegedly manipulating Bridgeport’s absentee voting system” no pieces of legislation to end a long string of election-related crime in Bridgeport made it into law in Connecticut in 2025?
The answer is because Connecticut is dirty. You don’t even have to show a government issued photo ID like a Connecticut driver’s license or non-driver photo identification card to vote, even though the vast majority of Americans support just such a requirement, across all races and ethnicities.
But that would make it harder for the Democratic Party of Connecticut to have people cheat on its behalf. Of the seven political operatives presently facing charges, five are associated with the Bridgeport Democratic Party. More than 150 charges have been filed according to Brown’s article on the “most significant criminal prosecution of election-related crime in Connecticut history.” It should be noted that all criminal defendants are innocent until proven guilty or they admit to a criminal charge.
According to the Chief State’s Attorney’s office, the charges include absentee voting irregularities, forged signatures, registering non-citizens to vote, illegally telling people how to vote, changing votes after they were cast and harvesting ballots to deliver to ballot drop boxes. The poster child for this whole nest of corruption is alleged to be Wanda Geter-Pataky, vice-chair of the Bridgeport Democratic Party.
But do not lose sight of why this corruption exists in Bridgeport. It benefits the Connecticut Democratic Party statewide! 
The more votes the Bridgeport Democratic Party can manufacture and send to Hartford, the better the election outcome for Democrats in statewide contests and in the 4th U.S. Congressional district. The Democrats control the five constitutional offices of governor (Ned Lamont), lieutenant governor (Susan Bysiewicz), attorney general (William Tong), secretary of state (Stephanie Thomas) and treasurer (Erick Russell). They also hold the two U.S. senate seats in Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal as well as the 4th U.S. Congressional District (Jim Himes).
Our Democratic Party of Connecticut has been benefiting from a corrupt Bridgeport for decades and it has no intention of stopping the voting scandals, which is why election reform is unlikely. 
Our Democrat Party has made a deal with the devil. In Goethe’s Faust, Dr. Faust is offered help by Mephistopheles, the Devil, to know, in a Biblical sense, the young maiden Gretchen. In exchange, Faust bets Mephistopheles that Mephistopheles can never make Faust so content that he will wish that moment to last forever.
The deal that our Democrat Party has made is that the Democratic Party of Bridgeport can abuse the election rights and expectations of Bridgeport residents to maintain the dominance of the Bridgeport Democratic Party over Bridgeport in exchange for the Bridgeport Democrats producing as many Democrat votes as they can as Connecticut’s largest city to elect Democrats statewide, the two U.S. senators and in the 4th U.S. Congressional District.
One result of this deal with the devil is one of the slowest state economies of all 50 states! Connecticut was one of the last states to regain the jobs lost in the 2008-2009 Great Recession in 2024. We are saddled with a corrupt political class.
Housing has been made so expensive to permit and build that it has been put out of reach for young buyers and young families. Connecticut has a high cost of living as well as anemic economic growth. The residents who leave this progressive paradise have a higher education level and more assets than residents who replace them with lower education and assets which is a loss to the entire state.
And who is the personification of this corruption of Bridgeport? In my opinion it is Mayor Joseph Ganim. After serving as mayor from 1991-2003 he was convicted of 16 federal counts in racketeering, extortion, conspiracy, bribery, mail fraud and filing a false tax return. According to Wikipedia, Ganim shook down Bridgeport city contractors for more than half a million dollars in cash, food, wine, clothing, home renovations and diamonds. He was sentenced to nine years in prison and about $475,000 in fines and restitution. He was released in 2010 after seven years in prison.
Part of prison is the concept of redemption and paying for your crime. Based on that Ganim again ran for mayor in 2015 and won. All slates were clear at that point.
I met Ganim twice in the campaign of 2017-18 when I ran for governor. The first time was after I had met with a civil rights advocate in the African American community in 2017 and then in April 2018 when the NAACP of Connecticut sponsored a gubernatorial debate in New Haven on prisoner re-entry into society. Present were candidates Lamont, Bysiewicz, Guy Smith, Ganim and me. My impression of Ganim was of an energetic and positive politician with a gregarious nature that would make you comfortable in his presence.
In 2019, when State Sen. Marilyn Moore opposed Mayor Ganim in the Bridgeport Democratic primary for mayor, Moore beat Ganim in the city’s voting booths, but she lost because of the city’s absentee ballots. How convenient for Mayor Ganim.
So here we are in 2025. Bridgeport Democrat Party operatives and members are charged with election fraud, complete with videos that appear to show ballot box stuffing. Again, all individuals are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
But the Connecticut legislature, controlled by Democrats, and the governor, a Democrat, have done nothing to clean this rot.
And so Connecticut will continue to be at the bottom of economic performance of the 50 states in growth as the pain of progressive policies continue to drown the state.
Andrew Brown: To answer your cogent question: no legislation tightening up against the election fraud alleged in Bridgeport happened in Hartford this year because Connecticut is a dirty state. 
Never say never, however, as even Dr. Faust changed course and with the intercession of Gretchen, whom he had betrayed, his soul was redeemed.

Interspersed in his comments about Kirk, Trump aimed insults at what he described as “radical left lunatics,” promoted his anti-crime campaign and teased a forthcoming announcement from the administration regarding autism. Vance spoke about his friendship with Kirk and attributed the electorate’s swing to conservatism to Kirk’s outreach, saying Kirk “changed the course of American history.”Vance joined Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi in recent days calling for consequences for Americans who criticized Kirk following his death. During his remarks at the memorial, Vance said he saw “the very worst parts of humanity” in comments and social media posts.  

 







The memorial service is held for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium on Sept. 21, 2025 in Glendale, Arizona. Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed on Sept. 10 while speaking at an event during his ""American Comeback Tour"" at Utah Valley University.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recounted meeting Kirk a decade ago when “he was building a movement.”“I still have this sticker (that reads) ‘Big Government Sucks,’” Hegseth said, recalling an early campaign slogan for Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded in 2012.Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said those devoted to Kirk will “defeat the forces of darkness and evil.”“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk. You made him immortal,” Miller said.Kirk’s wife Erika Kirk confirmed she will now sit at the helm of Turning Point USA as the nonprofit’s CEO after several speakers who heralded the organization’s future alluded to the change.In an emotional speech, she told those in attendance that she has forgiven the suspected shooter.“I forgive him because it was what Christ did. It is what Charlie would do, the answer to hate is not hate,” Erika Kirk said. During his remarks, Trump jokingly apologized to Erika because he said he “can’t stand” his opponents.Kirk “did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That’s where I disagreed with him. I hate my opponents and don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry, Erika,” Trump said.Musk, members of Congress in attendanceThe memorial service began at 11 a.m. Mountain time at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which seats upwards of 60,000.A large painting of Kirk, who was fatally shot 11 days ago at age 31, was displayed on stage. Large LED screens played videos and displayed photos of the activist, who was very influential among Republicans and conservatives.A seven-piece band backed Christian singer Chris Tomlin as Trump administration officials walked onto the floor of the stadium. Cameras captured the entrances of Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. All delivered speeches.Billionaire Elon Musk, a major donor to Trump’s 2024 campaign and the former leader of Trump’s government efficiency project, entered the stadium to cheers, according to CNN. Cameras caught Trump and Musk shaking hands and apparently speaking while seated together prior to Trump’s remarks.Current and former U.S. senators and representatives were among members of the audience, including former Florida U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz. A U.S. military color guard displayed flags during the national anthem.The memorial service was livestreamed and is available on C-SPAN.Journalists outside the stadium reported thousands of people lining up early hoping to attend the ceremony. Kirk was fatally shot by a suspected lone gunman on Sept. 10 while he was speaking at Utah Valley University, according to authorities, who are seeking the death penalty. NBC reported Saturday that law enforcement officials have not found any link between Kirk’s shooting and left-wing groups.Utah native Tyler Robinson, 22, is charged on seven counts, including aggravated murder, violent offense in the presence of a child and witness tampering. Authorities say Robinson sent text messages about “hatred” to his roommate following the shooting. Charging documents say Robinson’s parents recounted their son’s recent interest in LGBTQ rights and that he had started to “lean more to the left.”Charlie Kirk called a ‘martyr’Speakers praised Kirk’s work and at numerous points during the ceremony referred to him as a “martyr” for the conservative movement and Christianity.Far-right YouTube commentator Benny Johnson referred to Kirk’s “revival spirit” and influence in spreading a Christian worldview.“Charlie Kirk is a martyr in the true Christian tradition. You take out a tyrant, his power goes away. You cut down a martyr, his power grows,” Johnson said.Johnson called out Trump administration officials in the crowd as “rulers of our land.”  “May we pray that our rulers here, rightfully instituted and given power by our God, wield the sword for the terror of evil men in our nation, in Charlie's memory.

What’s next in the 2026 race?,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/pa-gop-endorses-garrity-for-governor-whats-next-in-the-2026-race/,The state party didn’t endorse a candidate for lieutenant governor.,"Stacy Garrity, Pennsylvania’s 78th treasurer, delivers her inaugural address Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, at The Forum Auditorium in Harrisburg, Pa., kicking off her second term in office. (Commonwealth Media Services)The Pennsylvania Republican Party endorsed state Treasurer Stacy Garrity in the 2026 race for governor during its fall state committee meeting in State College over the weekend.
Garrity, the only candidate nominated on the floor, was approved by a voice vote. A significant majority said “aye” in their support, while there were just a few ‘no’s’ in the crowd when asked if the party should endorse her in the race.
During her acceptance speech, Garrity highlighted her small town roots in Bradford County, plus her experience as a combat veteran and elected official as reasons why she’s positioned to take on incumbent Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro next year.
“While Josh Shapiro has taken more and more of your money, my office has returned more than a billion dollars to its rightful owners,” she said. “Rather than empowering bureaucracy to stop progress, we created Pennsylvania Money Match, removing red tape, and returning more than $40 million to Pennsylvania taxpayers.”
“And that is the fundamental contrast in this race,” she added. “While Josh Shapiro seeks to take more from you, I am running for governor to give back.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Garrity was first elected as state treasurer in 2020 after defeating incumbent Democrat Joe Torsella by just under one point. Her victory over the Montgomery County Democrat was seen as an upset and then she cruised to reelection in 2024.
Garrity claimed that Shapiro’s GSD “get stuff done” phrase is all talk and criticized his administration on a variety of policy issues including energy, crime, and education.
“Let’s be clear, Josh Shapiro has one priority, and it’s not you,” Garrity said. “Josh Shapiro’s priority is Josh Shapiro and the contrast between us could not be clearer.”
Garrity also stated that she’s not running for governor “as a stepping stone to something bigger,” a not-so-veiled jab at Shapiro for his reported interest in potentially running for president in 2028.
“My message to families all across our great commonwealth: help is on the way,” Garrity said. “And with your help, we’ll make Pennsylvania a safer, a stronger and a more prosperous place to raise your family and grow your business today and for years to come.”
On Saturday, Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Eugene DePasquale issued a statement saying that Garrity has sold out Pennsylvanians every chance she’s gotten and that she couldn’t be trusted in the governor’s office.
“Stacy Garrity has a long track record of views and positions that are wrong for Pennsylvania,” DePasquale wrote.
He criticized Garrity for supporting President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he said will negatively impact health care, energy jobs, and taxes.
“She has long fought for an extreme anti-choice agenda – celebrating the fall of Roe v. Wade and even selling anti-abortion merchandise,” DePasquale wrote.
Since launching her 2026 bid for governor, Politico reports that Garrity has stopped selling the anti-abortion merchandise on her campaign website and said she would not support a state abortion ban if elected, although she avoided directly answering questions about her position on the issue during an interview with Politico in September.
DePasquale also criticized Garrity for speaking at a rally in January 2021 that questioned the integrity of the 2020 election.
Garrity has since walked those comments back.
As the 2026 campaign plays out, Garrity and Shapiro still have to work with one another in their current roles in elected office.
Garrity said her bid for governor hasn’t changed the way she will be working with him.
“This is not personal. I just have a very different vision for our commonwealth,” Garrity told reporters. “It hasn’t changed at all.”
The 2026 general election is over a year away, but a trio of national ratings outlets, the Cook Political Report, Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and Inside Elections, indicate that Shapiro is the favorite, rating the race as “likely Democratic.”
Following the endorsement meeting, Garrity is set to embark on a week-long trip kicking off her campaign, dubbed the “Help is on the Way Tour,” and visit five different regions in the state for rallies.
Each rally will take place in counties that Shapiro won in 2022 over Mastriano. During Garrity’s successful reelection bid in 2024, she won three of those counties – Cumberland, Erie, and Bucks, while losing in more-Democratic friendly Allegheny and Lackawanna counties. 
Will Garrity have a clear path to the nomination?
Although Garrity now has the formal support of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, it does not necessarily mean that she will be the only candidate seeking the nomination.
State Sen. Doug Mastriano, who was the GOP gubernatorial candidate in 2022 and lost to Shapiro by double digits, has been teasing a 2026 run for months through social media posts and interviews.

Mastriano secured the GOP nomination for governor in 2022 during a crowded primary that saw the state party largely stay on the sidelines, while Trump delivered a last-minute endorsement to him.
Mastriano has repeatedly railed against the effort from the state party to endorse a candidate for governor at the fall meeting.
“ I spent 90 minutes with (Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman) Greg Rothman at our house expressing our opposition to an extremely premature endorsement,” Mastriano told WITF in August. “We think it’s a terrible idea and it’ll disenfranchise the grassroots, which we’re part of.”
Mastriano has also said that an endorsement of Garrity would not necessarily deter him from joining the 2026 race.
Rothman told the Capital-Star in an interview in February endorsing candidates early, like the state party did in 2024 for Dave McCormick, can make a “huge difference.”
Garrity echoed a similar sentiment with reporters on Saturday.
“Anytime you can get an early endorsement, it’s fantastic, and I am so honored to have the endorsement and the confidence of the leaders here of our grassroots party,” she said.
Peter Quaglia, a committeeman from Wayne County, noted that Garrity broke the record for most votes earned in an election in state history during her 2024 victory as a reason the party endorsed her.
“I’m personally somebody who’s normally against endorsements, but this is a situation where, not to endorse her would be an abdication of our responsibility to the party,” Quaglia said. “She’s been gift-wrapped for us, basically in terms of somebody to go up against Josh Shapiro.”
Republican state committee members that spoke with the Capital-Star said they were unsure if Mastriano would decide to enter the race. 
How will Trump impact the race?
Garrity and Mastriano are both vocal supporters of President Trump and his administration.
Trump’s endorsements usually hold a lot of weight in GOP primaries in Pennsylvania and beyond.
In 2022, Trump backed Mastriano and Mehmet Oz in their respective primaries for governor and U.S. Senate. Both candidates won the primary, but lost in the general election. 
Trump has not formally announced his support for a candidate in the 2026 Pennsylvania race for governor. 
“I was so honored to campaign with President Trump in 2024 and he and I led the ticket,” Garrity told reporters. “And so I would be honored to get his endorsement.”

“And between now and when I get it, I will be working in all four corners of the great commonwealth to get the endorsement of every voter in Pennsylvania,” she added.
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party is already attempting to link Garrity with Trump in the 2026 race.
“If Stacy Garrity does become the GOP insiders’ pick for governor, they will be making a clear choice: pledging allegiance to a candidate who has pledged her own allegiance to Donald Trump and a dangerous agenda that will hurt the people of Pennsylvania,” DePasquale said. “The voters of the commonwealth know they can’t trust someone like that anywhere near the Governor’s office.”
Trump won the state’s 19 electoral votes in 2024, although recent approval ratings show that the president approval rating dropping in Pennsylvania.
Val Biancaniello, a GOP committeewoman from Delaware County, credited Trump’s message in 2024 for his victory, as well as the GOP’s “Swamp the Vote” strategy, which also encouraged Republicans to vote-by-mail. Although Democrats vote-by-mail in larger numbers, Republicans did increase their share of voting by mail in the 2024 election.
In August, Trump sent out a post on social media that he was going to “lead a movement” to end mail-in voting.
No endorsement for the race for Lt. Gov.
The Pennsylvania Republican Party during Saturday’s meeting decided to push back it’s endorsement in the race for lieutenant governor until their next state committee meeting in 2026.
Garrity declined to say who she wanted to join her on the ticket.
“That process will play out,” Garrity said. “So, we’ll deal with that at the next state committee meeting in February.”

Guy Ciarrocchi, a GOP committeeman in Chester County, believes it is important to have a strong candidate in that race, as well.
“I think the important thing is this last three years has been about showmanship,” he said. “I think Stacy wants to build a ticket where things will get done, where we’ll finally pass budgets on time, where we’ll deal with school choice and empower parents.”

Rand Paul says Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brandon Carr’s criticism of comedian Jimmy Kimmel was “absolutely inappropriate.”
“The FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I’ll fight any — any — attempt by the government to get involved with speech. I will fight,” Paul said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
At the same time, Paul said, “people have to also realize that despicable comments, you have the right to say them, but you don’t have the right to employment.”
 The Kentucky Republican dodged saying anything directly critical of President Donald Trump as host Kristen Welker asked about Trump’s threats to broadcasters’ license over negative coverage of him and the president’s demands over the weekend that Attorney General Pam Bondi criminally prosecute his political enemies.
“I think lawfare in all forms is bad,” said Paul, asserting that Democrats had misused the justice system to unfairly punish Trump when Democrat Joe Biden was president. 
“It’s wrong now. But you have to put it into context also and acknowledge that the king of all lawfare was Biden and the Democrats for four years. What they did to Donald Trump was an abomination. But yes, it is not right for the Trump administration to do the same thing.”
Paul also contended that the Biden administration had engaged in censorship, pressuring social media companies during the pandemic to police content related to COVID-19.
ABC, which is owned by Disney, suspended comedian Kimmel’s late-night show after FCC chairman Carr criticized some of his remarks about the killing of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk and Trump’s response to it. 
Paul said that he and his wife, Kelly Paul, had spoken at Kirk events, including on college campuses. Kirk was debating with students at a college in Utah when he was fatally wounded. 
Paul said that Kirk stood out from “a lot of the argumentation you see either on TV or on the internet where everybody’s drowning people out” because of his willingness to hear opposing points of view. “He actually would listen to people. So I think he’ll be remembered for that and also being remembered for a guy that was trying to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. And that I think should be applauded.”
With the risk of a government shutdown looming at month’s end if the Senate cannot agree on a temporary spending plan, Paul, a deficit hawk, said, “I’m not going to vote for the Republican plan or the Democrat plan. I think eventually they come together. But typically, the compromise is to make things worse. The compromise through the years is the right gets more military spending, the left gets more welfare spending, and the deficit continues to explode.
“Our debt has been downgraded; our triple A rating has been taken away. There is unrest, and I do believe that we face serious problems as a country if we don’t do something so simple as just start spending what comes in. Balance our budget.”
Paul was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against Trump’s tax and spending bill in July.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado, along with 15 other states, is poised to sue the federal government for ignoring endangered species regulations in a wide range of infrastructure projects on public lands. One of those projects, a controversial proposal to expand an oil shipping facility in Utah, would significantly increase hazardous rail shipments through Colorado.
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, and the attorneys general of the other states provided in a July 18 letter to Trump administration officials a 60-day notice of their intent to sue. The notice expired last week.
The letter cites violations of the Endangered Species Act it says have occurred in pursuit of an executive order, called “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” which President Donald Trump signed on his first day in office in January. 
“The ESA and implementing regulations do not allow agencies to routinely avoid and delay implementation of the ESA’s protections of endangered species and their critical habitats in the manner you have directed and which your agencies are carrying out,” the letter says.

The letter was addressed to Trump, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the directors of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
The letter lists pipeline, cable and mining projects in states from Washington to Illinois — including the Wildcat Loadout Facility Right-of-Way Amendment on U.S. Bureau of Land Management land near Price, Utah — that it says pose risks to listed endangered species or critical habitat for fish and aquatic mammals from rainbow trout to salmon to sturgeon to whales.
The letter says Trump’s executive order declaring an energy emergency to fast-track fossil fuel production, despite record oil production in the United States, “unlawfully directs the (Army) Corps and Interior to bypass legal requirements, including those provided in the ESA. Congress did not authorize agencies to routinely bypass the ESA’s requirements to develop the President’s preferred energy sources.”
Asked if by signing onto the pending endangered species lawsuit, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is signaling he intends to join a separate lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s “energy emergency” executive order, a spokesperson for Weiser said that has yet to be determined.
“The notice of intent to sue to enforce the ESA could be a basis for joining the lawsuit challenging the White House energy emergency executive order,” Weiser spokesman Lawrence Pacheco wrote in an email this month. “The attorney general, however, has not made a decision on joining the EO lawsuit.”
Pacheco did not provide additional information on when the endangered species litigation will be filed or how it will be announced.
“We announce all lawsuits that we join or file ourselves,” Pacheco said. “I don’t have any idea on timing.”
Sued by environmental groups
The Wildcat Loadout expansion, as first reported by Newsline in 2023, has been plagued by air quality violations and other matters related to Native American antiquities. It would allow crude oil producers in the Uinta Basin to vastly expand drilling and transportation, including by rail through Colorado. Another proposed project in the basin, the bitterly opposed Uinta Basin Railway, would allow for even greater oil shipments. When the U.S. Supreme Court in late May cleared the way for the 88-mile rail link project, proponents said their next step was “completion of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) process.“
The BLM in early July invoked Trump’s emergency declaration to complete an accelerated environmental review of the permit for the Wildcat facility, which could increase oil capacity on the main rail line through Colorado by up to 80,000 barrels a day. Combined with the expansion of other nearby facilities, it will allow for the trucking and transfer to rail of up to 75% of the oil proposed for the Uinta Basin Railway project.
The railway project, estimated to cost at least $2.4 billion to build, would allow for up to 350,000 barrels of oil per day — more than doubling U.S. oil-by-rail transport — to move in heated oil tankers for 100 miles along the headwaters of the Colorado River, under the Continental Divide at Winter Park and through Denver on their way to refineries along the Gulf Coast. Backers of the project are seeking low-interest U.S. Department of Transportation private activity bonds.
Eagle County and five environmental groups sued to overturn U.S. Surface Transportation Board approval of the railway in 2022. They were initially successfully, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a favorable 2023 federal appellate court decision. Eagle County has long sought more direct state involvement in litigation opposing the project.
In a press release following the Supreme Court ruling, Keith Heaton, director of Utah’s Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, which has been using taxpayer dollars to pursue the railway project, said, “It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability. We look forward to continuing our work with all stakeholders to deliver this transformative project.”
The coalition is not a sponsor of the Wildcat Loadout project.
Asked for project updates and comment on the pending endangered species litigation, Melissa Cano, director of communications for the Uinta Basin Railway and the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, replied in an email: “At this time, the coalition does not have additional information or updates to provide beyond what has already been made publicly available. What I do wish to stress is that the Uinta Basin Railway Project is moving forward.”

(Photo by Peter Macdiarmid, Getty Images)Armed with new data that show nearly $1 billion was spent on dental emergency room and hospital charges in 2024, a wide coalition of health care advocates is pushing the Legislature to approve a new mid-level dental health care provider known as dental therapists.
Floridians for Dental Access is an effort led by Dr. Frank Catalanotto and it’s got the blessing of House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, who first sponsored the legislation as a freshman legislator. Past attempts have been quashed by the Florida Senate, which has targeted billions on bolstering the state’s health care workforce in recent years but has been unwilling to sign off on the idea.
Rural counties are some of the hardest hit by dental shortages and cost increases with nearly 41% of Florida’s 32 rural counties reporting a 77% increase in dental-related hospital and emergency room billings.
With Senate President Ben Albritton pushing for hundreds of millions in state dollars for rural Florida’s counties and Perez nearing the end of his two-year leadership in the House, Catalanotto says the 2026 session is go time.
“We kinda feel like it’s now or never. It’s gotta be this year,” Catalanotto, a former dean of the University of Florida College of Dentistry, told the Florida Phoenix.
“I can’t be specific about it, but we are working on several approaches to work with the Florida Senate on it. “

Dental therapists are similar to physician assistants. They can perform preventative and routine dental care, such as filling cavities, placing temporary crowns, or extracting teeth. They work under the supervision of dentists, while leaving the more complicated dental procedures for the dentists.
As of now, no bill has been filed for the 2026 session. But the 2025 language would have required dental therapists to follow several steps: 

Graduate from an accredited dental therapy school.
Complete a dental therapy practical or clinical exam produced by the American Board of Dental Examiners.
Complete at least 24 hours and up to 36 hours of continuing education biennially to maintain licensure.

Dental therapists would have to work under the supervision of a dentist but that could be under general supervision via a collaborative agreement without having the dentist on-site or without the dentist examining the patient first. 
During a CareQuest Institute for Oral Health webinar on dental therapy, panelists testified that dental therapists make about one-third to one-half of what dentists earn. CareQuest is a nonprofit “championing a more equitable future where every person can reach their full potential through excellent health.”
 Florida’s got an access problem
The latest available federal Health Resources and Services Administration data show an additional 10,143 dental practitioners are needed nationwide to address the dental health professional shortage. The agency supports programs like scholarships, loan repayment, and training to bolster skilled health workforces in underserved areas.
In Florida the problem is particularly acute. 
The state needs 1,259 additional dental providers to care for the nearly 6 million people lacking dental access. Dental health professional shortage areas means there’s a population-to-provider ratio of at least 5,000 to 1. 
American Dental Association data demonstrate Florida’s lack of dentists. While the overall dentist-to-100,000 population ratio in the U.S. was 59.5 in 2024, it was 52.4 in Florida. The ADA 2025 report shows that in Florida just 25.6% of the dentists participate in Medicaid, below all neighboring states.
An inside look at the numbers
The WellFlorida Health Planning Council — the private, nonprofit organization and state-designated local health council for 16 counties in North Central Florida — and Floridians for Dental Access have distributed data that show about 146,000 people went to the hospital or emergency department for dental care in 2024 and hospitals billed nearly $1 billion.
“These people are suffering and we as a society are paying for it. What I could have done with $1 billion and a dental therapist would have been unbelievable,” Catalanotto said.
More than 20% of the 2024 tab was billed to Medicaid, the taxpayer-supported health care safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled. “No pay” accounted for another 17% ($167.3 million) of the 2024 dental-related billings.
At nearly $1 billion, the 2024 costs represented a 77% increase in hospital billings since the group started tracking the data in 2021.
Between 2021 and 2024, dental costs went up for nearly all 32 rural counties across the state. Only Liberty and Glades counties saw decreases in their hospital-related dental costs during that time. 
Conversely, there was a 592% increase in hospital-related dental in Madison County even though the number of patients increased by about 23%.
Mum’s the word
The Florida Dental Association did not respond to Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment for this story.
The FDA has long opposed any effort to authorize dental therapists. In testimony before the Health Professions & Programs Subcommittee earlier this year, FDA chief legislative officer Joe Ann Hart insisted dental therapists wouldn’t improve public health. Authorizing dental therapists, she said, would allow someone “right out of high school with three years of dental therapy training to perform irreversible procedures such as extractions and administer local anesthesia.”
Catalanotto conceded the FDA, which he once belonged to, has a “wonderful lobbying system,” and a strong PAC.
“Everyone of these legislators has a dentist. And they can get their ear. And they can tell them stories,” Catalanotto laments.
The American Children’s Campaign is another proponent of dental therapy. Its president, Roy Miller, criticized the FDA for its pushback against dental therapy, saying in a prepared statement that it “ignores the soaring pain and suffering and doesn’t make any sense.”
“Dental therapists must pass the exact same licensing exam as dentists for the procedures they perform. They would be supervised by dentists. And it would be voluntary on whether a dentist would add them to their practice, as well. There are many dentists in Florida who support dental therapy, and the FDA certainly doesn’t speak for them.”

(Adam Thury/Mitchell Republic)One of South Dakota’s wealthiest businessmen says an aspect of economic development often gets overlooked — great public schools.
“If families know their children can get a top-quality education in Mitchell, that makes us more attractive than bigger, busier places,” said Roger Musick, who started and sold the telecommunications and software company, Innovative Systems.  
In mid-August, Musick devoted $33 million to education in his hometown of about 15,000 people. That includes a $15 million endowment for Mitchell Public Schools, another $15 million for Dakota Wesleyan University, and $3 million to get program expansions rolling immediately without waiting for the endowment to collect interest. 
Bank of America will invest the money. The endowment will earn about 7% annually. Five percent will support programs each year. Two percent will be reinvested to grow the account. 
A five-member board will oversee the programs. Members include Mitchell’s superintendent, the school board president, one board appointee, Dakota Wesleyan’s president and Musick.
Working parents
Musick has brought a lot of workers to Mitchell over his decades in business. He said it wasn’t the Corn Palace, the lake or the city’s events that convinced applicants to move. What they wanted was a quality education system for their kids and a safe place to leave them during the workday. 
So one of the projects expands Mitchell’s “Begindergarten” program. The class serves children old enough for kindergarten who are not quite ready socially or academically. 
The state funds only a half-day Begindergarten program, which limited access for working parents, Musick explained. The endowment expands Mitchell’s program to allow for full-day classes.










I want to live in a society where everybody is well educated, not just the people that can afford it. I have nothing against private education, but it will typically only be available to people who can afford it. Public education is what we have to have.


– Roger Musick


Musick said enrollment has already risen 80%, and the goal is to make it so that parents do not have to choose between waiting another year or sending their child unprepared.
After-school programs are also a priority. With the new funding, each public elementary school is hosting its own after-school program, staffed by certified teachers and aides, so parents no longer need to arrange rides to off-site locations.
“Some kids have great support at home to get their homework done. Some don’t,” Musick said. “This way, every child gets that help, and they also get experiences they might never have had otherwise.”
Students complete homework, receive tutoring, and participate in activities like sports and the arts.
“I hope this becomes a really good workforce recruitment tool,” Musick said.
Tressa Wede, director of education and community engagement at Dakota Wesleyan in Mitchell, said demand is high. She said at L.B. Williams Elementary, where she previously taught, about 140 students are already taking advantage of the after-school program. 
“The reception has been phenomenal,” she said.

At the university, the endowment will pay for teaching scholarships — encouraging more students to pursue careers as educators. Additionally, the fund will pay for Mitchell teachers to pursue their master’s degree. Musick said that’s all because teachers in South Dakota struggle with low salaries, discouraging people from pursuing the profession. The state ranks 46th nationally for teacher pay.
“Our teachers are far more valuable than that, and we need more emphasis there,” Musick said.
Wede said the initiative is making Mitchell’s teachers feel valued and she expects more aspiring educators to choose the community to call home. The master’s degree program requires scholarship recipients to teach in Mitchell for three years.
“This is probably the most exciting time I have experienced as a teacher,” she said. “We go into this because we want to make a positive difference, and here we are being supported in doing that.”
A belief in public education
The public school funding boost in Mitchell comes amid statewide ideological and political battles over education. 
Republican lawmakers in Pierre are weighing reallocating more public school funding toward alternatives such as homeschooling or vouchers. Some have leveled allegations that public school teachers are indoctrinating children and passed a bill to “protect students” from “divisive concepts.” They debated legislation during the last session requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted and taught in public school classrooms statewide. The bill narrowly failed in the House after passing the Senate.
Musick attended Mitchell’s schools and sent his children there. He said public education remains essential and deserves more focus and respect.
“I want to live in a society where everybody is well educated, not just the people that can afford it,” Musick said. “I have nothing against private education, but it will typically only be available to people who can afford it. Public education is what we have to have.”
Musick said he will track progress through the district’s report card and feedback from teachers. He hopes the project inspires other communities and state leaders to put more focus on public education.
“If you look at countries where people are happiest, like Norway and Denmark, education is really valued. Teachers are paid well and thought of highly,” Musick said. “That’s the kind of culture we need here.”
But even if Mitchell’s population never grows beyond 15,000, Musick said the gift will still have been worth it, because “we’ll have a lot of people who are smarter and more successful because of this focus on education.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-21 13:58:53+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,I don’t want to close any more mental health centers,Christopher Tuttle,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/i-dont-want-to-close-any-more-mental-health-centers/,The cost of operating our clinic with optimal staffing simply exceeded by a wide margin the amount we received from insurers – largely the state Medicaid program MassHealth – to operate it.,"LATE LAST YEAR, I made the hard decision to close a mental health center in Lynn, an area where more access to care is needed, not less. The cost of operating this clinic with optimal staffing simply exceeded by a wide margin the amount we received from insurers – largely the state Medicaid program MassHealth – to operate it.  
While my organization, Bridgewell, is both mission-driven and nonprofit, we can’t operate programs where the resources do not exist to support those programs. 
There is, however, a solution. Current legislation on Beacon Hill would permanently fix this funding gap, by boosting Medicaid rates for community mental health services and reviewing those rates every two years to ensure that the rates stay ahead of the cost of delivering the care. 
Mental health centers play an invaluable role at a time when behavioral health needs are surging, particularly among children who are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic while coping with pressures like cyber-bullying that did not exist when I was growing up.  
People seen at mental health centers have diagnoses including anxiety, PTSD, suicidal ideation and attempts, sexual and physical trauma, and significant substance use complexity. These centers provide individual and group therapy and are particularly adept at involving the entire family to devise solutions that can help patients recover.  
Mental health centers help create healthy communities. 
In addition to serving the needs of individuals, mental health centers also play an indispensable role in training clinicians. When mental health centers close, the Commonwealth loses training capacity for mental health practitioners. The irony is that many people complete their training at a mental health center and move on to private practice, where they can earn enough to repay their student loans. 
Across our organization, we currently have 15 open clinical positions. It takes between six and nine months to fill these positions. Our leadership team is being pulled away from their day-to-day job to fill the gaps created by these vacancies.  
We serve about 5,000 individuals at the three remaining clinics we now operate and often have wait times of up to four months for an initial consultation. Despite this strong demand, our outpatient clinics are losing millions of dollars.  
The rates paid by MassHealth – which covers some two million patients across Massachusetts – simply aren’t enough to fully cover the cost of clinician salaries, administrative operations, and other expenses that are all essential to providing these highly valuable services. Many private medical practitioners have stopped accepting any insurance payments and instead charge fees that low- and moderate-income individuals cannot afford. Our clinics are here to serve those who have no other place to go to get the care they need. 
After the Lynn closure, Bridgewell now operates three mental health centers — in Lowell, Amesbury, and Danvers. Our Lowell and Amesbury clinics provide a full range of services for both adults and children. Our Danvers clinic is one of only two in the Commonwealth that serves adults with both intellectual and developmental disabilities and a co-occurring mental health diagnosis. 
The Lynn clinic faithfully served the community for more than two decades. Its closure was not due to a lack of need, but unsustainable financial loss at the hands of low reimbursement rates from MassHealth.  
S.874 and H.1396 would require MassHealth, specifically, to implement a 5 percent rate increase for all outpatient behavioral health services. It would also ensure that rates paid to mental health centers are no less than 20 percent higher than comparable behavioral health services delivered in private practices. Current rates do not adjust for the cost of the additional staffing, training, and programmatic requirements placed on mental health centers. 
Rather than systematically close sites, stagnant MassHealth rates may force Bridgewell to exit outpatient mental health altogether. Such an idea would have been almost unthinkable only a few years ago. Our organization grew up out of the community mental health movement. I expect other organizations could be confronted with the same challenge. 
Mental health needs are soaring. Thankfully, Massachusetts has demonstrated true leadership with the launch of the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform, which created a new “front door” for the state’s residents to access mental health and substance use services. 
But without a permanent fix to the reimbursement rate gap, we’ll continue losing ground in the quest to ensure access to vital mental health services for all. Let’s finish the job.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Nursing has sanctioned several licensed nurses for clinical errors, patient-privacy violations, theft of patient medications, and other issues.
Among the cases is that of Diane Tegtmeyer, 58, who has been sanctioned by the board on at least four occasions.
Board records indicate Tegtmeyer was charged in May 2025 with failing to assess or evaluate the status of a patient, and with committing an act that may adversely affect a patient’s welfare.
The board alleged Tegtmeyer committed “medication errors” by documenting, on multiple occasions, that she had administered medication to residents of a care facility although video footage confirmed she did not enter those residents’ rooms.
The case was settled with Tegtmeyer agreeing to having her license placed in probation for 36 months during which time she will be subject to monitoring of her practice.
Tegtmeyer has faced disciplinary charges from the board on at least three prior occasions.
In 2005, Tegtmeyer, then known as Diane Teske, was accused of falsely charting that she had given residents of a care facility their medication while instead placing “the medication in the garbage.” The board ordered Tegtmeyer to complete 30 hours of training on ethics.
In 2007, the board alleged Tegtmeyer was fired by her employer for taking the credit card of an associate and using it to make purchases at Walmart. She later pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card forgery, according to board records. The board fined Tegtmeyer $50 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training in ethics.
In 2015, the Board of Nursing alleged Tegtmeyer failed to report a 2012 criminal conviction for tampering with records  and charged her with knowingly making misleading or untrue statement related to her credentials or licensure status. The board also alleged she falsified records related to the submission of a urine sample for lab testing. In resolving the case, the board fined Tegtmeyer $500 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training on ethics.
Other Iowa-licensed nurses sanctioned by the board include:
— Nancy Buttry, 53, who has agreed to surrender her nursing license. According to court records, Buttry was living in Harlan in 2023 and working for the Heritage House Senior Living facility in Atlantic. In April 2024, the board charged her with excessive use of drugs in a manner that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety.
In July 2024, the board dismissed the charges and Buttry was enrolled in the Iowa Professional Health Committee program that assists nurses with substance abuse issues.
Also in 2024, the board initiated a separate investigation into Buttry and, in January 2025, it charged Buttry with violating her contract with the committee. According to the board, Buttry had “not engaged in any of the Iowa Professional Health Committee’s requirements and was not in regular contact with the program” and had not participated in extended outpatient treatment.
Rather than contest the allegations, Buttry agreed to surrender her license.
— Lauren Haldin, who was charged by the board in April with misappropriating medications, property, supplies, or equipment of patients or a clinic; failing to properly safeguard or secure medications as required; and failing to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client.
The offenses allegedly occurred while Haldin was working as a registered nurse at a Des Moines area behavioral health hospital in 2024. The board alleges the hospital fired Haldin after concluding she had stolen controlled substances. According to the board, surveillance video and medication records indicate that on multiple occasions, Haldin  pulled the drugs from the hospital’s supply and then failed to document the drugs as being administered to patients.
Haldin recently agreed to a settlement that calls for her license to be placed on probation for two years. The agreement also calls for her to complete a substance abuse evaluation, enroll in a chemical-screening program, and complete 16 hours of educational training on medication safety and nursing documentation.
— Cynthia Bustos, who was charged in April 2025 with failure to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client, and with misappropriating medications, property, supplies, or equipment of patients or a clinic.
The board alleged the violations occurred while Bustos was practicing in Allison and that she had been suspended from employment “at a rehabilitation facility.” According to the board, that facility’s records indicate Bustos claimed, on seven occasions in September 2024, that she had administered hydrocodone to patients, although the “hydrocodone card and narcotics count sheet” could not be located.
To settle the case, Bustos agreed to have her license placed on probation for one year and to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
In 2022, the board charged Bustos with failing to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client while employed in home care. According to the board, “multiple clients” had claimed that Bustos had not visited them and provided care on the dates she claimed to have been there. To resolve that case, Bustos agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on medical documentation.
— Sherley Beaufils, who in recent years has been licensed to work as a nurse in Iowa and 45 other states. Beaufils recently agreed recently to surrender her license – an action that comes three and a half years after she was convicted of five counts of health care fraud, one count of conspiracy, five counts of aggravated identity theft and five counts of making false statements related to health care matters. As a result of the criminal convictions, the board alleges, Beaufils was sentenced to 87 months in prison and ordered to pay $1.6 million in restitution.
— Tonya Zimmerman, who was charged by the board with leaving a nursing assignment without ensuring the safety and welfare of her patients, and failing to assess and evaluate a patient.
The board alleged that while employed at Angels Care Home Health from October 2023 to April 2024, Zimmerman “fraudulently charted and abandoned her patients without a valid notice” to her employer. She was also accused of failing to see seven patients who were on her schedule, two of whom required wound care, and of documenting that she had visited patients at times when her computer tablet was known to be at her own residence.
Zimmerman was fired by Angels Care Home Health, according to the board. To resolve the board’s disciplinary charges, Zimmerman recently agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
— Debra Wolterman, who was charged by the board with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare, violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of patients, and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
The board alleged that at some unspecified time in the past, the hospital where Wolterman worked fired her after it determined she had repeatedly accessed patients’ records for no work purpose and without the patients’ consent. The patients included several of Wolterman’s co-workers at the hospital.
To resolve the case, Wolterman agreed to receive a warning and to complete 30 hours of educational training on patient privacy.
— Pamela Rosendahl, who was charged by the board with failing to properly document an assessment or evaluation of a patient, and with engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public by participating in a sexual, emotional, social, or business relationship with a patient.
The board alleged that Rosendahl worked as an nurse at Advanced Correctional Health and was assigned to an unspecified county jail from about October 2023 to April 2024. The board alleged she crossed professional boundaries by developing an inappropriate relationship with an inmate to whom she passed out candy in violation of jail policy.
The board alleges that jail records also show two inmates called Rosendahl on her personal phone 11 times, and that she failed to document treatment she provided to one inmate on about 30 separate occasions.
To settle the case, the board agreed to issue Rosendahl a warning and to require that she complete 25 hours of educational training on documentation, ethics, and appropriate boundaries with patients.
— Patricia Jean Stanley, 64, of Des Moines, who recently agreed to surrender her license after being criminally charged with the financial exploitation of an older individual.
According to the board, Stanley pleaded guilty to the charge in February 2025, admitting that she took money from the retirement account of an older person who was not able to consent to the exchange. Stanley was sentenced to a prison term of no more than five years.
Court records indicate Stanley took more than $5,900 from the 88-year-old victim, identified in the records as a relative of Stanley’s. The court records show that previously, while working at Des Moines’ Broadlawns Medical Center in 2023, Stanley was charged with, and later convicted of, theft for her handling of the relative’s finances.

This story by  Tom McKone was first published by The Montpelier Bridge on Sept. 17.
Almost two dozen terra cotta and stoneware clay faces emerge from the surface, top to bottom, starting small and gradually increasing to full heads, creating the illusion they are coming into the room from the past. 
These are the faces of struggling people. Life’s hard for so many around the world today, as it was for all ancestors, I think, as I look at Burlington artist Susan Wilson’s “Becoming I,” at the opening of “Holding: Mementos Kept, Memories Kindled,” this year’s Art at the Kent exhibit at Kents Corner in Calais.
“As I work clay over, my simplified head forms — the faces of those who inspire me — emerge,” she writes. “I travel with those who are searching, yearning, asking questions, and struggling to move forward in their lives.”
Wilson’s works evoke the past, our shared and personal memories and our shared humanity — themes developed by the 22 Vermont artists in the Kent exhibit.
As visitors start their journey in the rambling, nearly two-century-old building, they walk through a hallway with 39 portraits.
“We wanted to show the breadth of humanity on this wall,” says Cornelia “Nel” Emlen, one of three curators. “We all have our own stories that we’re holding.”
Curator Allyson Evans calls the wall a “human container … emblematic of every person.”
Twelve of those works are exquisite portraits by Middlesex artist August Burns, who has two additional portraits in other parts of the exhibit. Burns, who painted the official portrait of Gov. Howard Dean, is one of two artists in this show who have painted official portraits of former Vermont governors. Middlebury artist Kate Gridley painted Gov. Jim Douglas’ portrait.
David Schutz, the third curator, says when they met with artists and developed the theme for this year’s exhibit, talking with Gridley convinced them to focus on memory. They gave her a room for 58 small paintings, in which she painted objects from her earliest memories, more or less chronologically, through her life.
In a brochure accompanying her installation, Gridley writes that years ago, when her very smart, aging father began experiencing dementia, he “amassed an enormous library of neurology books,” and the brain and memory became a regular part of their conversations.
“As daughter, I was losing him. As artist, I wanted to find a way to embody the explorations about memory that we had been sharing,” Gridley writes.
Burlington artist Jennifer Koch’s installation, “Specimens,” is distributed through the show and includes plenty of found objects. In an extraordinary series of shadow boxes, Koch starts with classic European paintings, then constructs an outrageous, three-dimensional headdress out of incongruous objects, from musical instruments and kitchen utensils to paint brushes, trophies and parts of toys. At first, the shadow boxes are just interesting, then they become addictive.
“Gratitude in a Time of Loss,” East Montpelier artist Daryl Burtnett’s installation about Covid-19, which was shown in the Vermont Supreme Court Gallery last fall, is the first art to ever be given a room on the museum’s third floor. The hundreds of small pieces, each acknowledging a Vermont life lost to the epidemic, are now in a different configuration from the previous show.
Juliana Jennings, co-owner of J. Langdon’s antique shop in Montpelier, has filled a space the size of a walk-in closet with hundreds of old items from her home — not from the store.
Self-trained Barre folk artist Gayleen Aiken (1934-2005) is featured in the self-contained Spotlight Gallery. With crayon, pen, pencil, and oil paints, Aiken created paintings, drawings, and cardboard cut-outs. Her works are in the permanent collections of several large museums, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.
The monthlong exhibit opened Sept. 12 and runs every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., through Oct. 12. In addition to Words Out Loud, there are several special events during the month, all described at kentscorner.org.
With beautiful weather, live music, and catered food, the opening celebration on Sept. 13 attracted several hundred visitors. The closing celebration will be held on Oct. 12, from 3 to 5 p.m.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Joe Major: The importance of civil discourse in Vermont and nationwide.","Dear Editor,
The recent fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk is a stark and tragic reminder of just how fragile our democracy and our civil society can be when disagreements cross the line into violence. 
Let me be clear: I fundamentally reject much of the rhetoric Kirk stood for. His words often carried racism, homophobia and misogyny that do real harm in communities across this country. But the test of our democracy is not whether we defend speech we agree with. The test is whether we defend the right to speak for those we most vehemently oppose.
As a public servant, I will always fight for that principle. The First Amendment must apply to everyone, or it means nothing at all.
Here in Vermont, I’m grateful that our politics remain rooted in civility, even when we disagree. Republicans and Democrats in our Statehouse debate with passion, and we certainly don’t see eye to eye on every issue — but the tone of those debates is grounded in mutual respect. At the end of the day, we share the same mission: to do what is best for Vermonters. That spirit of collaboration has allowed me to work across the aisle on meaningful legislation.
With Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, I’ve served on the Judicial Nominating Board to select fair and qualified candidates for our Supreme Court. With Sen. Randy Brock, R-Franklin, I helped pass a significant tax break for military retirees and survivors, exempting their benefits from state income tax. With Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, though we often hold views that are worlds apart, I’ve been proud to serve as vice chair to the Senate Agriculture Committee that he chairs. 
In my first year, he was a mentor, ensuring the committee stayed focused on helping Vermont’s farmers above all else.
This is the Vermont way: respectful discourse, shared responsibility and compromise where possible. But I recognize that this way of governing is not guaranteed. It is tenuous, and it must be protected. 
If we allow ourselves to stop listening to one another, if we refuse to find common ground, then the very freedoms we cherish — the right to speak, to disagree and to live in peace despite our differences — are at risk of slipping away. 
That is why I will continue to fight for both the right to speak freely and the responsibility to do so civilly. Our democracy depends on it.
Sen. Joe Major, D-WindsorHartford

By Ryan Colasant    This season was bound to bring many firsts for the University of Delaware as they transitioned into FBS football. This game against Florida International University ensured more first time occurrences as the Fightin’ Blue Hens took on their first conference foe in the two programs first ever meeting.
In a season filled with first time milestones, UD introduced itself to Conference USA in a big way defeating the FIU Panthers on the road, 38-16, Saturday evening.
The Blue Hens started the game with a field goal on their opening possession. The Panthers retaliated with a promising drive that landed them at UD’s ten yard line. Panther quarterback Keyone Jenkins dropped back on third down and looked right searching for a receiver to come open in the endzone. Jenkins thought he found an open target and fired a pass that landed in the blue gloves of Delaware safety Mysonne Pollard.
Pollard’s interception stalled FIU’s momentum, but didn’t result in points for the Blue Hen offense. UD was forced to punt the ball away on its ensuing offensive possession. The Panthers started the next drive on their own 46-yard line and three plays later held a 7-3 advantage over the newcomers.
The scoring stalled there. The UD defense didn’t allow a single point the rest of the half and allowed the Blue Hen offense to take control of the game in the second quarter outscoring the Panthers, 21-0.
Their first score of the frame followed Pollard’s second interception of the half, turning the ball over to the offense at their own 45-yard line. Running back Jo Silver capitalized on Pollard’s first-ever two-interception game with a 14-yard touchdown run, returning the lead to UD.
On the next drive, Blue Hen quarterback Nick Minicucci connected with graduate receiver Nick Laboy in the back right of the endzone for a two yard score increasing their lead to ten.
UD’s defense forced a three and out on FIU’s next possession and the Panthers punted the ball to Kyre Duplessis. Duplessis caught the punt and shed a couple of arm tackles blazing through the middle of field before settling down the left sideline. The Coastal Carolina transfer followed his career day against UConn with another career milestone completing a 68-yard punt return with a trip to the endzone.
FIU tried to score before halftime but a key sack from graduate student Dillon Trainer on third down forced the Panthers to try a field goal as the clock dwindled down. The Panthers got the kick off just in time, but it fell wide right.
The Blue Hens held all the momentum from there and never let up, scoring two more touchdowns in the second half courtesy of a couple Minicucci touchdown throws to Laboy and Viron Ellison Jr.
The Blue Hen offense finished the game with over 350 yards of total offense and just one turnover. Manicucci threw for 218 yards and three touchdowns to go along with one interception. Laboy finished with just two catches, but both were touchdown grabs setting a new career high for touchdown catches in a game.
UD played a clean game compared to FIU only committing two penalties against FIU’s seven. The defense compiled five tackles for loss, two turnovers and held CUSA’s fourth highest scoring offense to just 16 points.
The Blue Hens sit atop the conference standings after the win and hold claim to the conference’s second best scoring offense.
The Blue Hens next game will be on October 3 against the conference’s top scoring offense of Western Kentucky University.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/b386fe75-7647-4917-970b-cc0a63ae9a0e.png,,,2025-09-21 08:56:52.237663

Many northerners were outraged that the law compelled them, under threat of a prison sentence or stiff fine, to work in support of slavery.

Image via the Brooklyn Museum
History is littered with unintended consequences. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 is a prime example. Envisioned by Congress as a way to ease tensions between the North and South over the brutally painful issue of slavery, the law served only to inflame regional resentments.
Many northerners were outraged that the law compelled them, under threat of a prison sentence or stiff fine, to work in support of slavery. Specifically, the law required state and local officials to assist the federal marshals who were tasked with capturing and returning people who had escaped slavery. Ordinary citizens could also be charged with a crime if they appeared to “knowingly and willingly obstruct, hinder, or prevent” the seizure of formerly enslaved people.
Just how badly Congress miscalculated when it passed the law became clear in Vermont, where the state government instituted its own new statute that made the federal law virtually impossible to enforce. In doing so, Vermont lawmakers argued that abiding by the Fugitive Slave Law would violate both the state and federal constitutions. 
The Fugitive Slave Law was part of a series of measures that together became known as the Compromise of 1850. The laws were an attempt to balance the interests of the free and slave states in resolving issues arising from the Mexican-American War. Victory had brought vast new territories under American control, so Congress needed to decide whether any new states being created would allow slavery.
Hammered out by Whig Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky and Vermont-born Democratic Sen. Stephen Douglas, who represented Illinois, the compromise admitted California as a free state and banned slavery in Washington, D.C. In return, Congress declared that settlers in Utah and New Mexico could decide whether those territories would permit slavery. In late September, Congress also passed the Fugitive Slave Law, which constituted a major strengthening of existing laws.
The Burlington Free Press responded to the Fugitive Slave Law with an extraordinary editorial. Ostensibly writing to formerly enslaved people who were seeking freedom, the newspaper declared: “We think a good deal more of the Slave who has the spirit to attempt to assert his ‘inalienable right’ to personal liberty, than we do of the white man who would deprive him of that right.”
“KEEP OUT OF THE CITIES,” the Free Press advised. “Morality and Humanity are dead among City officials. Where men congregate together in great herds, the vicious and inhuman altogether predominate over the just and humane.” Cities breed greed, the editorial argued, and their populations “care very little about freedom.”
Instead, the Free Press suggested Vermont as a destination: “Go into the uncontaminated COUNTRY. Seek our quiet Villages, where the Mountains and the Valleys and the Streams and the Air, are the Evangelists of Freedom. Go into an atmosphere that Slave-Catchers cannot breathe and live — where Habeas Corpus and Trial by Jury are substantial realities, and will not be surrendered till the Constitution authoritatively demands the sacrifice. Don’t stop among the many, but among the few. Come to Vermont….”
The Free Press editor was building on Vermont’s reputation as an opponent of slavery. In 1777, the state had become the first state to ban slavery in its Constitution. That prohibition, however, came with a significant asterisk — it did not apply to males under the age of 21 or females under 18. Also, there was no enforcement mechanism, so incidents of people being enslaved in Vermont continued into at least the first decade of the 1800s. In 1835, mobs in Rutland and Montpelier disrupted antislavery speeches by a touring minister. Vermont’s record was hardly unblemished.
But much had changed in Vermont during the decade and a half leading up to 1850. Antislavery speakers and writers had persuaded some Vermonters to change their views. More importantly, the war with Mexico offered tangible proof that, left unchecked, slavery would likely spread. The massive territories that came with the American victory threatened to bring perhaps five new slave states into the Union. Some Vermonters tolerated slavery where it had already taken root, but they were deeply uncomfortable with allowing it to grow.
In the weeks after the Fugitive Slave Law’s passage, Vermonters gathered at meetings around the state to denounce it. The Brandon Post listed six meetings in Rutland County alone (Brandon, Rutland, Wallingford, Castleton, Poultney and Benson).
The Friends of Liberty of Chittenden and Addison counties advertised an “Indignation Meeting” to be held in North Ferrisburgh to protest the law, which had made Vermont a “Slave Hunting ground and our citizens Human Blood Hounds.”
The Burlington Courier published an article headlined “How To Oppose the Fugitive Slave Law,” which argued against violence, rebellion and mob rule, “(a)nd yet we mean resolutely to oppose the (law), and to use all our influence to prevent its execution.”  
While arguing for the law’s repeal, the St. Albans Messenger tried to calm people’s passions. “We hope that Vermont will express none of this fanatical law-breaking disposition which is too manifest in many places out of the state,” it wrote. “Ultraism and fanaticism of every kind is now glutting itself on the excitement in reference to this bill.” The newspaper urged Vermonters not to “imitate this worst feature of southern manners, and resort to nullification and anarchy.”  
Vermont Gov. Charles Kilborn Williams, an ardent abolitionist who once declared that any law supporting slavery was “unchristian” and “violates the right of nature,” helped push a bill through the state Legislature that made the Fugitive Slave Law effectively unenforceable in Vermont. 
The statute became known as the Habeas Corpus Law, after the legal procedure under which courts review whether a person is being detained or imprisoned legally. Under the new law, Vermont state’s attorneys of each county had to bring any alleged fugitive before a judge. If the judge failed to release the accused, the defendant had the right to a trial by jury, with the state covering the costs. Given public sympathies, Vermont juries would have inevitably ruled against the enslavers.
The law put Vermont at the forefront of the fight. No other state passed a new personal liberty law between 1850 and 1853, though some Northern states followed suit after that time.  
Vermont’s law faced harsh criticism. Editors of the Daily National Intelligencer, a newspaper in Washington, D.C., that advocated gradual emancipation, wrote: “We are mortified and astonished that such an enactment should not only have received the concurrence of the Legislature, but the sanction of the Governor.”
President Millard Fillmore was outraged with Williams and the Vermont Legislature. “(T)he president and the entire Cabinet are very much exasperated at the course of proceedings in the Vermont legislature,” reported the Memphis Daily Eagle, “and … they determined to enforce the fugitive slave law in Vermont, should a case arise there, if it required the whole military force of the United States to do it.”  
Opponents of the Vermont law criticized the state for engaging in “nullification,” the claim that individual states have the right to ignore federal laws they believe are unconstitutional. Two decades earlier, South Carolina lawmakers had famously attempted to nullify federal tariffs they said promoted Northern interests over Southern ones.
Supporters of the Vermont law, however, argued that the state statute was more constitutional than the federal one because habeas corpus and its guarantee of due process are enshrined in both the U.S. and Vermont constitutions.
The Natchez Democrat newspaper in Mississippi saw things differently. “This law is clearly and palpably unconstitutional, and ought to be and will be kicked out of every court in Vermont, unless the person sitting upon the bench is either a knave or a fool,” the paper opined. The newspaper said the law had been “smuggled through” the Vermont Legislature late in the session, when many lawmakers were absent “and the rest (charity would suppose) were drunk.”

In Memphis, Tennessee, the Daily Eagle saw Vermont’s effective blocking of federal law as dangerous. “A government that is not able to enforce its own laws is in reality no government at all. It is a shallow humbug, a misty form, a legal mockery; and should be done away with as speedily as possible,” the paper argued.
The editor of the Georgia Journal and Messenger informed readers that “the acts of the Vermont Legislature will be everywhere regarded in the South as a dangerous aggression.” Still, despite what the writer termed Vermont’s “treasonable propensities,” he wasn’t concerned. “Happily the State is so utterly insignificant in numbers, wealth, and influence that her efforts to sever the bonds which hold us together need excite no other feeling than that of contempt.”
The Argus of Albany, New York, however, saw Vermont’s action as a dangerous escalation of tensions. “Vermont has begun the work — South Carolina may follow,” the paper wrote. “What state will next step into the arena, and nullify another part of the constitution? If this work is to go on, where will the end be? What will become of the constitution or law, or of the Union itself?”
Indeed, a decade later, South Carolina took the ultimate step of nullification when it became the first state to secede from the Union.

It’s a reminder that while Michigan has made real progress against opioid overdoses, the crisis is far from over. We have to keep going.
As an anesthesiologist, a physician specializing in anesthesia, I work with some of the most powerful pain-relieving medications available. In the operating room, drugs like fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone are invaluable. At the right doses, these opioids relieve pain and ease anxiety. I have seen how these drugs can also slow breathing, drop blood pressure, or stop a heart.
That’s why anesthesiologists train for years to balance benefit and risk, adjusting every dose to the age, health and history of the patient we care for, even any previous opioid use. We also use nerve blocks and non-opioid medicines to minimize the amount of opioid given. In healthcare, opioid delivery is anything but “one size fits all.”
Outside healthcare settings, the picture is different. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is has become widespread — cheap to produce, far stronger than heroin and often hidden in counterfeit pills or powders. I’ve spoken with families who lost loved ones after unknowingly taking one of these pills. With fentanyl, overdoses can happen so quickly that emergency help may not arrive in time.
That’s why naloxone, the medication that can reverse an overdose, is so critical. Michigan has taken major steps to expand access through pharmacies, community nonprofits and even vending machines. Insurance companies often cover it, and hospitals send kits home with patients who may be at risk of overdose. Naloxone is a proven, non-addictive rescue medication that reverses overdoses and saves lives.
Our work isn’t done. We need to make sure every community, every school, and every family that wants naloxone can get it easily.
Through the Overdose Prevention Engagement Network, my colleagues and I are working to make opioid prescribing safer, educate communities and help Michigan continue leading the way in reducing overdoses. We’re proud of the partnerships we’ve built with the state to distribute naloxone widely. Sustaining and expanding these efforts will take ongoing support from policymakers, health professionals, families, schools and faith groups alike.
On this National Opioid Awareness Day, I hope people will remember two truths: opioids can be a vital tool when given by trained specialists, like anesthesiologists, and they can be deadly when obtained illicitly or used without medical supervision. If you or someone you love is at risk, make sure naloxone is nearby. And if you’re experiencing challenges with opioids or are concerned about opioid use disorder, you can find help by visiting Michigan’s Substance Use Disorder Services & Programs Dashboard.
Michigan has shown national leadership in overdose prevention, yet our work continues. Now we must keep acting to sustain that leadership — to protect our neighbors, preserve live, and build a future where pain is relieved safely and overdoses are no longer a leading cause of death.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-21 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Could Roger Wicker be part of another rare bipartisan health plan in U.S. Congress?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/21/roger-wicker-broger-wicker-bipartisan-health/,Roger Wicker helped pass a key bipartisan health program in 1997 that helped poor Mississippi families. Will he do something similar in 2025?,"There is a chance that a rare case — not a pandemic but a single occurrence of bipartisanship on a health care issue — could break out in the U.S. Congress before the end of the year.
Such cases are few and far between, but national press reports indicate that the Republican-controlled Congress, fearing the backlash in the 2026 midterm elections, is pondering extending the program that provides enhanced federal financial assistance to people purchasing health insurance policies through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.
If the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025 as scheduled, it would create a substantial increase in cost for the millions of Americans who get their health insurance coverage through the marketplace exchange — a key component of former President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
During the administration of former President Joe Biden, Democrats increased the federal subsidies provided to help people pay for the ACA exchange policies. No Republican voted for the enhanced federal subsidies just as they did not vote for the ACA in 2010.
But now fearing a backlash in the 2026 midterm elections, some are reportedly trying to find a way to extend the enhanced subsidies for at least another year. 
If the federal financial assistance for the cost of the marketplace policies expires, Mississippi will be hit particularly hard.
Unless Congress acts before the end of the year, the price of the marketplace’s health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 annually in Mississippi, according to KFF, a national group that conducts health care research. The subsidies are provided based on income levels, so the costs for some could be much higher next year if the enhanced assistance expires at the end of 2025.
Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF. Only Texas has seen a greater increase at 255%.
Many of the Republicans who expect tough elections in 2026 now want to extend the program.
Republican Roger Wicker of Tupelo, Mississippi’s senior U.S. senator, is not up for reelection in 2026, but he has at times worked with Democrats on bipartisan health bills.
In 1997, Wicker, then a new member of the U.S. House, was part of a bipartisan alliance that passed the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helped children of the working poor obtain health insurance.
The program has been pivotal in Mississippi, a state with one of the nation’s highest poverty rates and a large segment of its population working in low paying jobs. About 85,000 Mississippi children are enrolled in CHIP, according to Medicaid.gov.
The creation of CHIP occurred against big political odds. Before it was proposed, then-President Bill Clinton tried to pass his version of universal health care with First Lady Hillary Clinton leading that effort. The bill, which was derisively called Hillarycare, was savaged. The bill crashed and burned and created considerable ill will in Washington.
But in the wake of that failure, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Sens. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, passed CHIP. Hillary Clinton, history should note, is also credited with playing a role in the passage of CHIP.
Wicker was part of that bipartisan effort. Wicker, who had been a member of the state Senate only three years earlier where he chaired the Public Health Committee, viewed CHIP as a proposal that would help Mississippi families.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, who at the time was the Senate majority leader, opposed CHIP, calling it “a big government program.” Thad Cochran, the state’s senior U.S. senator, like Wicker, supported the program.
And Cochran, a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee for years, played pivotal roles in ensuring CHIP continued in future years when it appeared it might be in jeopardy.
In 2025, it will be interesting to see if Wicker or any other member of Mississippi’s congressional delegation is instrumental in ensuring the enhanced subsidies continue for the ACA exchange.
After all, all four U.S. House members and Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state’s junior U.S. senator, will be up for reelection in 2026.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190605/Roger-Wicker-7.jpg,,,2025-09-21 07:57:26.832948

A vital doctrine of animism is the attribution of conscious life to phenomena of nature. Even if our own beliefs about the soul and its corporeal habitats do not extend quite so far, though, the human mind still likes to anthropomorphize — to assign emotions and personality traits to flora and fauna as a means of extolling their value. Perhaps no one understands this better than a poet. This week, Isla Segal of Woodstock relays observations of the omnipresent, nonverbal exchanges that enliven every forest.

Trees talk
Isla Segal, 14, Woodstock
The trees talk,
you know?
They talk and if you listened,
you would know
they whisper
like kindergarteners
who can’t stand straight in line
but can jump straight
into mudpuddles.
They can’t stay quiet,
like my siblings late at night,
and the wind whistles sometimes,
and the trees call back,
you know?
And then the leaves twirl
down to the dirt,
but the branches still murmur
late into the winter,
with too much snow to talk very loud – 
but they’re still talking.
I know.

“Vermont will bear the burdens of this facility but might not directly reap the environmental benefits that it provides,” wrote a commissioner in a concurring opinion.

The Public Utility Commission gave the green light Monday to an 80-acre industrial solar field development on a sloping hillside of sprawling meadows, thick forests and agricultural fields in Shaftsbury.
Neighbors of the project and environmental advocates in southern Vermont have vehemently opposed the project first proposed in 2023 due to the potential environmental and aesthetic harm to the land. Multiple organizers said they are likely to appeal the commission’s decision to award VT Real Estate Holdings 1 LLC — also known as Shaftsbury Solar — a certificate of public good.
Alongside consideration of local impact, the commission’s decision in favor of the Connecticut developer, Freepoint Solar, owned by Freepoint Commodities, was “heavily informed by Vermont’s ambitious energy policy goals” outlined in the state’s public service statute, according to the final decision, signed by Chair Edward McNamara and Commissioner Riley Allen.
“We have also considered Vermont’s role within the broader, interconnected New England grid and our reliance on that network to maintain a reliable electric grid and to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction mandates,” McNamara and Allen wrote. 
The decision comes after Vermont reportedly failed to meet its carbon reduction targets this year, and a judge dismissed a lawsuit attempting to hold the state accountable for this failure. 
Commissioner Margaret Cheney wrote a concurring opinion to the decision, agreeing that the project “checks all the necessary boxes” of Vermont statute, but voiced concern with the location and the tree clearing required to make way for the large-scale solar project.
While the project itself will occupy 80 acres when complete, Cheney wrote that 104 acres would be disrupted during construction, including 64 acres of agricultural land. Forty-two acres of trees will be axed, including 34.6 acres of mature trees, Cheney added.
Forests sequester carbon, so tree clearing partially counteracts the greenhouse gas benefits associated with the addition to the renewable energy grid, Cheney wrote. The power and renewable energy credits created through the project can also be sold outside the state, so “Vermont will bear the burdens of this facility but might not directly reap the
environmental benefits that it provides,” she wrote.
If renewable energy development prompts deforestation and a lack of substantive benefits to Vermont utilities and customers, the commission may reconsider how they arrive at “public good” determinations for future projects, Cheney asserted.
“We should consider how to create incentives to site very large facilities away from unspoiled land and close to existing infrastructure,” Cheney wrote. “Although this goal may be best achieved through future legislative amendments, renewable energy developers should be more deliberate in identifying sites that minimize localized aesthetic and environmental impacts.”
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said the Shaftsbury project is the “solar equivalent” of the controversial, industrial-scale Lowell Wind Project over a decade prior.
While in favor of solar canopies in developed areas, Smith expressed concern about the industrial project on agricultural land increasing stormwater runoff, degrading prime soils and harming biodiversity of the area. She said the fuel energy and clear cutting of mature trees necessary for the project counteracts any positive environmental impacts. 
“This is going to do nothing to reduce carbon emissions,” Smith said. “There is no need to destroy an ecosystem in order to create solar electricity for the region.” 
Meanwhile, the town government and regional planning commission have taken a different stance on the project. 
Shaftsbury Select Board Chair Zoe Contros Kearl wrote in a Friday statement that the proposed construction has been “painfully contentious,” but that the board hopes residents will focus on the solar project’s positive impacts for the town now that it has been approved. 
“The Town will benefit from this project in numerous ways — including increased funding for our elementary school, substantial property tax contributions that will make a real difference in our annual municipal budget, and the funding of a new brush truck for our Fire Department,” Kearl wrote. 
Bennington Regional Planning Commission Planner Callie Fishburn wrote in a Thursday statement that the Shaftsbury solar project’s approval will further the region’s renewable energy goals. The commission is requiring the solar developer to manage the concerning impacts of the projects, Fishburn wrote, “including in the areas of aesthetics, preservation of agricultural soils and damage to infrastructure,” Fishburn wrote.
Steve Collier, general counsel for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, said that “solar projects raise substantial — and sometimes competing — interests,” but a certificate of public good requires long-term protection of agricultural soils, which the developer agreed to and should be followed. 
“Renewable energy is important and beneficial. Preserving agricultural land and our ability to grow food is critical,” Collier wrote. “We are concerned about the ongoing loss of farmland and believe Vermont needs to thoughtfully use and maintain it.”
Jim Porter, director for public advocacy for the Department of Public Service, wrote in a statement Friday that the department found no engineering problems or aesthetic concerns with the project, as the developer plans to implement mitigation measures recommended by the department and neighbors to the project. 
The solar development aligns with the present and future energy service needs and conforms with the Vermont Comprehensive Energy Plan based on expert testimony provided by the Department, Porter wrote.
Judith Schwartz, a Bennington resident and environmental journalist who wrote a commentary on the Shaftsbury Solar Project, opposes the idea that deforestation is necessary for renewable energy development.
As a result of the Shaftsbury solar project development, a piece of southern Vermont’s wildlife corridor between the Taconics and Green Mountains will be lost, and threatened beech and white ash trees will be axed in the process of constructing solar fields, Schwartz said.
Tony Eprile, Bennington resident and Schwartz’s partner, said the pair are not against solar but think renewable energy should be planned in already developed areas in order to mitigate environmental impacts. He also expressed concern that the solar energy created will add to the grid rather than replace fossil fuels, feeding a “bottomless demand for energy” created by data centers and Artificial Intelligence technology. 
“Green energy is a very pretty term for somewhat less damaging energy sources,” Eprile said. “There’s no way that you can produce solar panels without doing some environmental damage.”
Kit Ausschnitt, a neighbor and intervenor to the project, noted that the company lawyers wrote in July that the economic viability of the project hinged on the Public Utility Commission making a swift decision, citing changing tariff policies and $20 million of federal solar subsidies that the developers could lose.
In a letter to the Public Utility Commission, Ausschnitt expressed concern that the developers may abandon the project after it’s begun if it’s rendered financially unviable, meaning the natural environment would be already tampered with and “no economic benefit can flow to the community, the State and the people of Vermont.”
Ausschnitt said he is in favor of ambitious renewable energy goals, but the push created by the Legislature to develop renewable energy at the expansive forests and agricultural land is “counterproductive.” 
“It’s just a beautiful natural area.” Ausschnitt said. “They’re going to destroy lots of habitat and create all kinds of environmental damage and flood risk in an area that is already prone.”
Freepoint Solar’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

(Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)Louisiana has shifted one of its two large pharmacy benefits contracts for state employees away from CVS Health, but Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers kept the most lucrative agreement with that pharmacy giant in place. 

The state Office of Group Benefits will now use two pharmacy benefit managers for its health insurance plans that cover state government employees, public school teachers, local government workers, retirees and their families. Previously, it had only used the CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health. 

Louisiana lawmakers signed a new arrangement Thursday with Southern Scripts, owned by Louisiana-based Liviniti LLC, that pays the company $390.6 million to handle commercial insurance plans for the Office of Group Benefits. They also approved a contract with SilverScript, another CVS Health affiliate, for $748.8 million to manage Medicare Part D prescription plans, which many retired state workers use.

The contracts were enacted on emergency bases for 2026 with the possibility of extensions for 2027. 
For years, lawmakers have been upset with CVS Caremark, the state’s current pharmacy benefit manager. The company’s contract with the Office of Group Benefits made it difficult for independent pharmacies to serve the 212,000 public employees, teachers and others with state health coverage. 
Governments and private employers hire pharmacy benefit managers, also called PBMs, to oversee prescription medication benefits for their health insurance plans. But independent pharmacists say PBMS are driving them out of business by undercutting their reimbursement rates and favoring chain pharmacies the PBM parent companies own. 
For example, CVS Health owns Caremark, SilverScript and well over 100 pharmacy locations throughout Louisiana. 
The state’s new arrangement with Liviniti should allow more independent pharmacists to start serving those enrolled in commercial state health insurance plans. The Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association endorsed the contract a few days before lawmakers approved it. 
The state’s experience with seeking out a new pharmacy benefits manager over the past few months indicates how difficult it has been to move away from CVS Health however.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The state approached six companies about taking over its business, said Heath Williams, CEO of the Office of Group Benefits. Three were not interested and none could provide a contract proposal for Medicare Part D enrollees that was financially competitive with CVS. Only Livinti offered a deal that could go up against CVS for commercial insurance plans. 

By switching to Livinti and SilverScript, enrollees in commercial plans should have more options for pharmacies they can use, but the Office of Group Benefits will end up spending a few million dollars more than it would have if it had stayed only with CVS Caremark. 
“You are not going to save money from moving from one to PBM to another,” Williams told lawmakers Thursday. 
Louisiana faced more challenges finding a company not owned by CVS to cover its Part D enrollees because federal regulations place restrictions on how the state can negotiate that contract, he said. 
The state does expect more transparency about drug pricing as a result of the new PBM contracts. Williams said it should be easier for the state to determine what is driving up drug prices and whether rebates, which can financially benefit  PBMs, are to blame.   
“You want full transparency on rebates,” he said. 
The new PBM contracts come a few months after a dramatic showdown between the governor and the Louisiana Senate. 
During the last few days of a two-month legislative session in June, Landry pushed lawmakers to pass a law banning Louisiana pharmacy benefit managers from also owning in-state pharmacies as CVS does. The Senate refused to go along with Landry’s demands and killed the proposal, saying such a drastic move required more study before lawmakers voted on it. 

At the time, CVS claimed such a ban would force it shut down its brick-and-mortar locations in Louisiana. They exerted pressure on legislators by sending emails and texts to thousands of Louisiana residents, implying they could potentially lose access to their medications at CVS if the bill passed. 

The mass text and email campaign prompted Attorney General Liz Murrill to file three lawsuits against CVS on behalf of the state, including one regarding the text messages.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cvs.jpg,,,2025-09-21 06:56:26.059992
