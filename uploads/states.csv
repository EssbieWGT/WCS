Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan are considering a wide-ranging bill that could affect Medicaid, Alaska oil and gas development and the size of the federal debt. (Alaska Beacon file photos)The U.S. Senate is nearing debate on a wide-ranging bill that includes a series of last-minute changes that would uniquely offset or exempt some of its costs for Alaska. 
The changes highlight the importance of the votes of each Republican senator — including those of Alaska Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — to advance the bill, named the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” after its description by President Donald Trump. It includes much of Trump’s agenda, and is advancing under special reconciliation rules.
In the days leading up to any floor votes, Alaska health experts said cuts to Medicaid and food stamps in the bill would devastate Alaska health care providers, patients and the broader state economy connected to health spending. Medicaid is the primary health program for lower-income Americans, and pays for long-term care for a broad swathe of families. More than 231,000 Alaskans were enrolled in May.
Murkowski and Sullivan have expressed support for provisions of the bill that seek to increase oil and gas production in the state, though Murkowski has criticized proposed cuts to health care and nutrition funding. It’s not clear how each would vote on a final bill. 
An updated 940-page version of the bill was released on Friday evening. It includes a variety of changes that would distinctly affect Alaska and, in some cases, Hawaii. 
As reported by States Newsroom and the New York Times, these changes include:

a tax exemption for fishers in Western Alaska;
an increase in amount of expenses like exploding projectiles that whaling captains can deduct, from $10,000 to $50,000; 
an increase in the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government by 25% for Alaska and 15% for Hawaii; 
allowing the Alaska and Hawaii state governments to request an exemption from a work requirement for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients; 
a two-year exemption for Alaska and Hawaii from paying a higher share of SNAP expenses; and
an increase in payments to certain providers for services in Alaska and Hawaii through Medicaid, the insurance program for people 65 and older, as reported by the New York Times. 

Alaska providers and advocates had expressed alarm 
Before the latest revision, Alaska health care providers and advocates said they were alarmed by the cuts to Medicaid in the bill.

	Preliminary research by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage estimates that the bill’s Medicaid cuts would cost Alaska 3,000 lost jobs — the fourth-steepest loss among the states — and a $322.1 million decrease in the economy. 
While the bill’s drafters aim for the Medicaid cuts to save money, they will be costly to Alaska, said Emily Nenon, Alaska government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. She spoke at a news conference held by provider and advocacy groups on Wednesday.
“We need people to have access to health care before they need it … because outcomes are better, because we have a healthier workforce,” Nenon said. 
Nenon said the primary way people would lose access to Medicaid is by requiring them to report that they are working. She pointed to research showing that many who work or are eligible for other exemptions will lose access to Medicaid because they don’t meet the reporting requirement. 
“It’s not about whether people are working, most people that are going to be subject to these work reporting requirements are working,” she said. “It’s a matter of having another hoop to jump through.”
Nenon also noted the importance of Medicaid to the economy.
Alaska had 2,900 fewer employed residents in May than it had a decade earlier, in May 2015. Most industries contracted in that time, but health care grew by 7,900 jobs, more than any other industry by a significant margin.
Nenon said Alaska can’t afford the 3,000 lost jobs estimated by ISER, adding that having more people with untreated conditions or delayed treatment will also lead to fewer people being able to work. 
Rachael Miller, chief advocacy officer for the Food Bank of Alaska, expressed concern on Wednesday that shifting costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto the state government would present problems in Alaska, where the state government is already struggling with the state budget and with administering SNAP. She expressed concern about the combined effect of SNAP and Medicaid cuts on families.
“So we know that food is often the most flexible line in a household budget,” she said. “We know that people do sometimes — they can’t afford their prescription, they cut their nutrition budget, because they have to afford their meds, they have to rent and they have to pay their heat.”
Also on Wednesday, Petersburg Medical Center CEO Phil Hofstetter said the Medicaid cuts would require the hospital to focus more on meeting bureaucratic requirements. And he said reduced payments would lead to cuts to services and staffing.
“I just don’t understand the premise of these cuts improving health care when the highest cost of health care comes in through medevacs, ERs, and inpatient stays,” all of which would be increased by requiring people to wait longer for health care by reducing Medicaid, Hofstetter said. “We know that prevention is a much less costly avenue for health care, and it’s better for our patients in general.”
Dr. Casey Gokey, chief medical officer of Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center, noted estimates that up to 27,000 Alaskans could lose access to health care. 
“On paper, these work requirements might sound simple, but in practice they create a maze of paperwork and confusion,” Gokey said. “Many of our patients seasonal jobs, gig jobs, hourly jobs — jobs that don’t fit neatly into eligibility boxes. They miss a deadline, they get caught in red tape and suddenly, they’re uninsured.”
Gokey said she saw a cancer patient this week who delayed care because she couldn’t afford it. She applied for Medicaid months ago, but the application is still being processed, and the patient showed signs that the cancer may have spread, Gokey said. 
“This is not a one-off story,” she said. “This is a reality of what delayed care looks like.”
Fairbanks resident Kristen Lindsay, currently working as a sea kayak guide in Seward, said Medicaid helped her survive cancer. She was otherwise uninsured when she was diagnosed with breast cancer from an MRI she received on her 34th birthday. With Medicaid, she was able to have three surgeries to remove the cancer, radiation treatment and medication.











You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’


– Kristen Lindsay, cancer survivor and Fairbanks resident



	Lindsay then got a part-time job, without health insurance, but still had Medicaid. She’s grateful she didn’t have to spend time proving she was working while she was focused on getting better. 
“You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’” she said. She noted that seasonal work is common in Alaska, and Medicaid helps fill the gaps. 
Attention turns to senators
Health care providers and patient advocates haven’t been the only ones asking Murkowski and Sullivan to reject Medicaid and SNAP cuts. 
Alaska Senate Majority Leader Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, wrote a commentary for the New York Times published Friday with the headline “Alaska Cannot Survive the Big Beautiful Bill.”
“We fear that if this bill passes, a village in rural Alaska might lose its one and only grocery store because of a drastic decline in SNAP dollars,” Edgmon and Giessel wrote. “It might also lose its sole health care clinic or hospital because it cannot sustain its services with decreased Medicaid reimbursements. The reconciliation bill does not take into account the uniqueness of Alaskan lifestyles and geographic remoteness.”
While the Medicaid and SNAP provisions were the focus of attention for some, the state’s governor focused on other aspects of how the bill would affect Alaska. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy highlighted those aspects on social media on Friday. He noted that the bill would direct 90% of Cook Inlet oil gas lease bonuses, rents and royalties to the state starting in 2035; require four federal oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain; direct 50% of ANWR receipts to the state until 2034, and 90% from 2035 on; ease other mineral leasing restrictions and require the Bureau of Land Management to hold quarterly lease sales; and target more than $4 billion for “investments in shore facilities,” including $300 million for the homeporting of a polar icebreaker.
Despite the Medicaid cuts, the bill would raise the national debt by $4.2 trillion, according to the latest estimate by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — though the official cost is 90% lower, after Senate leaders made accounting for it differently than previous bills. They did that by excluding an extension of $3.8 trillion in tax cuts that Republicans want to make permanent.

June 28, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceAs the U.S. Senate prepares to vote on its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, joined Michiganders virtually for a Hands Off Medicaid rally in Lansing. 
While Murphy had originally planned to attend Saturday’s rally in person, the U.S. Senate vote scheduled for Saturday required that Murphy remain in Washington D.C. 
In addressing the crowd, Senator Murphy reiterated how devastating the GOP bill would be to most Americans. 
“We’re talking about 60 million people losing their health care,” Murphy explained, “most of those working Americans, a lot of them really, really vulnerable, very, very sick and disabled Americans. Many of those children. All in order to transfer that money to the very, very wealthy.”

Moreover, Murphy said, the plan has not been well-received by the public. 
“As people find out about this, they hate it,” Murphy noted. “With long-term distractions, in the first five months, we had a hard time breaking through. Well, now we’re breaking through because of what you’re doing today, because of similar protests all around the country like this, and this thing isn’t over until it’s over.”
The bill would extend the 2017 tax cuts approved by a GOP-led Congress during President Donald Trump’s first term, while also pushing through major spending cuts that would drastically downsize the federal government. 
Even if the Senate approves the measure, changes to the bill’s language will require it to return to the House for another vote. At least six congressional Republicans have since walked back their initial support, making it unclear whether the bill could garner enough votes a second time.
While Murphy headlined Saturday’s event in Lansing, Michigan leaders and healthcare advocates also spoke to the dozens who attended Saturday’s rally.

Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Healthcare, explained that this is not a partisan issue: as a doctor from West Michigan, many of his patients voted for Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Now, many of those same patients stand to lose access to their healthcare. 
As the only physician in the Michigan Legislature, Rep. Matt Longjohn (D-Portage) outlined how the proposed cuts to Medicaid would affect Michigan. 
“What it’ll mean is that there is uncompensated care, that there’s low value care, and that will break the bank for healthcare systems and hospitals and rural health centers alike,” Longjohn said. “It’s not good for patients, it’s not good for providers, it’s not good for systems, [and] it’s not good for communities.”

Longjohn also pointed out that 40% of Michigan’s budget comes from federal funds that are distributed to the state specifically to run programs like Medicaid. As such, he says the impacts of the proposed cuts would be disastrous to the state’s economy. 
“When you throw a boulder as big as this into a pond, you know the ripple effect will affect millions, and for a long time,” Longjohn said.
Beyond policy concerns, Longjohn expressed frustration with those advocating for the bill’s passage. 
“One of the things that frustrates me most is that the people pushing this are cowards,” Longjohn noted. “They will not answer voicemail, they will not answer letters, they will not show up to meetings with constituents.”
While Longjohn declined to name these legislators, others at the rally directly identified two by name: Reps. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) and John James (R-Shelby Township).

Nearly six months into their two-year terms, Barrett and James have largely avoided town halls. Since taking office in January, Barrett has held only two town halls– both of which were conducted virtually. James has yet to hold any constituent events and has not given any indication that he intends to do so. 
The Senate Budget Committee revealed the finalized language of the bill late Friday night. The first round of votes was anticipated to begin Saturday afternoon, but ongoing negotiations postponed the start of formal discussion. 
Murphy told the crowd that each day that final passage is delayed, the bill becomes less likely to pass. 
“Because right now, this country is waking up to the cataclysm that will occur if this thing passes,” Murphy said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.












Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance




Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Republicans from all corners of Montana convened in Helena during the weekend for the paryt’s annual convention and to elect new party leadership 
Delegates elected Art Wittich to serve for a two-year term as party chair. 
“Folks, I think our purpose is conservative government, and we’re going to do some things that haven’t been tried in the past,” Wittich said after his election. “… I want to keep winning elections, but I also want us to dedicate ourselves to things that are higher than winning elections, and that’s things like truth.”
Four party members threw their hats in the ring for leadership of the state GOP — Wittich, Stacy Zinn, Tanner Smith, and Troy Miller. 
Wittich was elected on the second ballot. Smith and Miller were eliminated after the first round of voting. 
He is an attorney and former state legislator who represented a portion of Gallatin County from 2011 to 2016, and served as Senate Majority Leader during the 2013 session.
Following the announcement of his election, Wittich told the gathered Republicans that they should all seek to be a “happy warrior,” and look forward to bright days for the party ahead. 
“We’re a red state. We could become a bright red state,” he said. “And we can do it without dividing and subtracting. We can grow.”

However the GOP convention on Saturday took a detour toward division when, during the credentialing of delegates able to vote for party leaders, state Sen. Barry Usher of Billings made a motion to remove nine fellow senators from the list. 
The nine state senators were censured by the GOP executive committee during the legislature over a series of votes taken in conjunction with Democrats to establish Senate rules and move forward large pieces of legislation including the state’s budget. 
A roll call vote among 241 gathered delegates saw more than two-thirds vote to remove the nine from their delegate roles. 
Among the nine Republican senators who appeared at the convention in person were Sens. Jason Ellsworth, of Hamilton; Denley Loge of St. Regis; Wendy McKamey of Great Falls, and Russ Tempel of Chester. 
Ellsworth told the Daily Montanan he was disappointed that the actions taken against the nine elected officials went against a message of unity that had been delivered during the first day of the convention. 
“It just cements division,” said Ellsworth, a former Senate president who was censured by the entire state Senate this year. “Republicans are strong, and should continue to be strong, but also recognize that, you know, it is a big tent, and it does take more than one philosophy.”
Loge told the Daily Montanan that he felt justified that his votes were in line with his constituents, who voted him in, as opposed to the executive board or state central committee. 
“The reason I’m the only Senator that’s Republican in part of Missoula County, and it’s because the constituents recognize I vote for them,” he said. 
With a total of 235 certified delegates voting for the party chair, Wittich earned 140 final votes and Zinn received 94, with one ballot excluded. 
Wittich replaces party chair Don “K” Kaltschmidt who served in the role for six years and oversaw a red wave through the state including Republicans winning all statewide elected offices, including the governorship, as well as all of Montana’s Congressional seats — for the first time in 100 years.
Kaltschmidt previously told the Daily Montanan that he was proud of his work turning Montana into a true red state, and that the next chairman would be tasked with leading the new era of GOP dominance. 
“It’s really up to the next chairman to take it to the next level, which would be learning how to be a red state,” he told the Daily Montanan.

Delegates elected members of the executive board including Zinn for vice chair, and Lola Galloway as secretary. 
Wittich’s tenure will last through 2027, a term which will span a legislative cycle election and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines’ reelection campaign. 
“I’m not tired of winning. I don’t think any of us are tired of winning,” he said. “I think when we embrace a positive vision for Montanans. They’re going to join us. They’re going to vote for us. They’re going to give us their time and their treasure, and we’re just going to keep getting bigger and better.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6314-1024x734.jpg,,,2025-06-28 17:04:13.685468

The bill also addresses concerns from Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska on access to food assistance for their constituents despite new restrictions on a USDA program for low-income people.As talks continued on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon, a handful of Senate Republicans, including Missouri’s Eric Schmitt and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were on the golf course with Trump, according to the White House. Graham said on social media that Kentucky’s Rand Paul also played.Senate Democrats said a fresh financial analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the preliminary Senate text would result in $930 billion in cuts over 10 years to Medicaid, the joint federal-state low-income health insurance and disability assistance program.The CBO score was not yet publicly available but Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, pointed to it and slammed the Medicaid provisions as “cruel” in a statement Saturday afternoon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, also cited the preliminary analysis, pointing to the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts. The House version was scored by CBO as making about $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years.Collins promises amendmentsSenate Republicans planned to take their negotiations to the floor and push for amendments after a procedural vote that will trigger official debate on the bill, which in its current public version runs 940 pages.GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voiced concerns throughout negotiations about rural hospitals and health cuts that would harm low-income individuals, said her vote on what is called a motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”“I will be filing a number of amendments,” she told reporters as she headed into a closed-door working lunch before the Senate convened at 2 p.m. Eastern.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he will vote “no” on both the procedural vote and final passage.While Sen. Tim Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that he was a “no” on the motion to proceed because of a provision to sell off federal public lands, the Montana Republican changed his mind nearly an hour later and declared he would propose an amendment to strip provision.The latest version of the measure, championed by GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, sets up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs. This will increase the supply of housing and decrease housing costs for millions of American families.”GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”“We won't bring it to the floor if we don't have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.Medicaid turmoilProposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he’s a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.“If you want to be a working-class party, you've got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.‘Even worse than any draft’Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.The lawmakers also planned to force a reading of the entire 940-page legislation on the floor ahead of the vote.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we've seen this far.”The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it's worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”“We'll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We'll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.House actionSenate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”",,,,2025-06-28 17:04:13.685468

Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photoSpeaker Emerita Melissa Hortman’s life embodied the American dream. She was raised in a family that owned a junkyard, became a lawyer but declined a life of comfortable wealth for public service, emerging as among the most influential legislators in Minnesota history.
Now she’s an emblem of the American nightmare, another victim — along with husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever Gilbert — of the political violence that’s consumed America in the past decade, adding Brooklyn Park to Buffalo, El Paso and other grim signposts of a damaged democracy.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral Mass at The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis Saturday as kind, generous and driven by a common set of values to make the world just a little bit better.
The funeral was mostly light on politics, despite the hundreds of politicos in attendance. Father Daniel Griffith in his homily, however, highlighted the injustices that Melissa Hortman tried to ameliorate.
“In Minnesota we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice — the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed our democracy.”

Tim Walz stand behind the caskets of Melissa and Mark Hortman during funeral services for Mark and Melissa Hortman at The Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis, Minn., on Saturday, June 28, 2025.

Gov. Tim Walz, who was both friend and governing partner to Hortman, was visibly shaken while serving as a pallbearer alongside the Hortman children. The packed Basilica was filled with Hortman’s family, friends and vast political network that Melissa Hortman built over decades by way of her effectiveness at the Legislature and down-to-earth charm. Former President Joe Biden — who hosted the Hortmans at the White House — Vice President Kamala Harris, former Gov. Mark Dayton, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and state commissioners also memorialized the lives of Hortmans.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
The Hortmans were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a politically motivated assassination. Their deaths have roiled Minnesota politics.
Hortman was a Catholic Sunday school teacher whose politics were shaped by Catholic social teaching. She was a devotee of the Golden Rule, from Matthew, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” So she would have endorsed the choice of Gospel reading Saturday, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, which is a fundamental text of Christianity.
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” Griffith said. “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.”
In his sermon, Griffith highlighted Melissa and Mark Hortman’s service and community, which he called, “the antidote to our present afflictions” and a stark contrast to the “idol of autonomy” that has ravaged America’s political landscape.
Melissa and Mark Hortman met in Washington D.C. when they were both mentoring a student. Colin and Sophie Hortman, their adult children, released a statement in the days after their killings, calling for people to honor their parents’ legacy by standing up “for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.”
Walz during his five-minute eulogy encouraged Minnesotans to find common humanity and “build a state equal to (the Hortmans’) aspirations and a politics worthy of their example.”
“Melissa was an extraordinary legislator, and Mark was her proudest supporter,” Walz said. “It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all of its significance, politics is just people. That’s all. It is just a bunch of human beings trying to do their best. Melissa understood that better than anybody.”
Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of Melissa and Mark, eulogized them at the request of the children. She remembered the Hortmans as anything but a stereotypical political family, just as focused on their children and dog and card nights and monthly dinners for law school friends as on the latest political flareup.
Williams also captured the dynamic between Melissa and her supportive husband.
“I always saw her as a balloon bouncing around, but still tethered to the earth by Mark,” Williams said.
Williams remembered the many dinners she shared with the Hortmans, including their last together on June 6 at an Italian restaurant in Robbinsdale. Walz had just called for a one-day special session, and Melissa was often getting up from the table to take calls from the governor or her DFL caucus members. No one at the table, including Mark Hortman, minded the disruption.

Even though many are grieved by the Hortmans’ deaths, Williams said that the couple would have wanted people to remember them with joy, citing Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet:”
“Some of you say joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”
“We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again,” Williams said. “Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way. Goodbye, my friends.” 
Colin Hortman ended the service with a prayer of St. Francis, which Melissa Hortman carried in her wallet.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
The procession departed in silence, except for the massive bell of The Basilica of St. Mary tolling, tolling.
The caskets were loaded into two hearses.
Walz handed Sophie and Colin Hortman American flags in the traditional 13-fold, for the Hortmans.
When the Hortmans were lying in state at the Capitol Friday, Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, wondered aloud what Melissa Hortman — who was famously blunt and unimpressed with grandeur — would have thought about all the pageantry.
“I think she would have said, ‘It’s a bit much.’”

(Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix))TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Seven years after the Florida Legislature approved a memorial recognizing the tragedy of slavery for the grounds of the Florida Capitol, the bronze statue called “Circle of Chains” has been completed and is on display across the street from the building.
Not that anyone is actually aware of that.
“I had no idea!” Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt told the Phoenix when asked about the public unveiling of the memorial earlier this week.
Neither did Miami-Dade County Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“I had no idea the memorial had even been installed – and that says a lot,” Jones told the Phoenix. “A monument honoring the pain and resilience of enslaved Africans deserves more than a quiet placement. After seven years of work, there should have been a moment to honor that history publicly.”
Approved in 2018
The Legislature approved the memorial during the 2018 legislative session. Miami-Dade Democrat Kionne McGhee sponsored the measure in the House, and Tampa Bay-area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson carried it in the Senate. The bill charged the Department of Management Services with developing its design, placement, and cost. It is located at the Black Archives-Union Bank Museum on Apalachee Parkway and was installed on April 28.
“The idea behind the memorial is to recognize the brutality of slavery and the cruelty of slavery towards a people and then to honor the nameless faces of individuals that suffer through slavery,” Rouson said this week.
State lawmakers dedicated $400,000 to erect the memorial, as they did during the 2016 legislative session for a Holocaust Memorial that was installed at the Capitol earlier this year. A public ceremony was held  for that event in March, attended by Gov. DeSantis.
The slavery monument was created by Carmel, California, sculptor Steven Whyte, selected by review committee members who called on artists to recognize “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the American colonies and to honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty contributions to the United States.”
As the House prepared to vote on the proposal in 2018, Rep. McGhee told lawmakers that slaves in 1845 helped construct the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee, according to WFSU-Radio. PolitiFact reported that although authorities were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction, African American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th Century, according to historians. PolitiFact labeled his comment “mostly true.” (McGhee, now a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, did not respond to a request for comment).
Plans for a formal ceremony
Rouson said he was informed by state officials that they wanted to install surveillance cameras on the property before making any formal announcement. “But now that surveillance is in place and there’s some protection in the event of vandalism, I intend to urge the Black Caucus to do more of a formal ceremony when we go back [this fall] for committee weeks,” he said.
Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said she knew the memorial was being constructed but wasn’t aware it had been finished and is now open to the public.
“I wholeheartedly support Sen. Rouson’s efforts for a formal opening ceremony this fall — the enslaved men, women, and children who built this country deserve to have their experience remembered and their legacy honored,” she said.
Sen. Jones said he also supports Rouson’s call for a “proper ceremony when we return.”
“Our ancestors deserve to be seen and acknowledged,” he said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Finance Committee convened at 10:17 p.m. Friday — over 12 hours after it was originally scheduled — to vote on a fraction of the budget areas it had originally planned and to release part of the literacy funding that is set to expire next week.  
Legislative leaders have been working behind closed doors over the last week to negotiate with Gov. Tony Evers and work out the details of the state budget as the end of the fiscal year approaches next week. 
Areas of the budget still left to take up are at the center of negotiations including the University of Wisconsin system, where Republicans have considered cuts, and the Department of Children and Families, which is responsible for the state’s Child Care Counts program. Evers has said he would veto a budget without funding for the program, which will run out of federal money soon. The committee also still needs to take up the Department of Health Services, the Department of Transportation, the capital budget and more. 
The committee co-chairs did not take questions from reporters ahead of the meeting, but as the meeting started Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said the other agencies “will be taken up at a later date.” He didn’t specify when that would be.
The budget committee did approve the budget for several state agencies including the Department of Natural Resources, part of the Department of Justice, the Higher Education Aids Board, the Department of Administration and the Tourism Department. Each action the committee did take passed along partisan lines.
Portion of $50 million for literacy released
The committee voted unanimously to release $9 million of the nearly $50 million left in funding for literacy initiatives that was first allocated in the 2023-25 state budget. The majority of the money has been withheld by lawmakers since 2023 and is slated to lapse back into the state’s general fund if not released by the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
Lawmakers said action on the other $40 million will be taken soon. 
“This has taken a long time to get here. One of the things that this bill was originally about was to make it so that kids could read. We want to help kids read. We want to give schools the tools to be able to do that,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said. “Unfortunately, it’s taken this Legislature a tremendous amount of time to allocate the funds for that, and ultimately, that’s simply not acceptable.” 
Born said he is glad lawmakers were releasing part of the money Friday and would have further motions on it in the future. He also said the delay on the funding was Evers’ fault. Lawmakers were holding the funding back due to a partial veto Evers exercised on a bill related to the literacy funding. The Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Wednesday that partial veto was  unconstitutional and restored the original language of the law.
“We’re glad that justice has been done, and we’re here now with the proper accounts and able to do these two separate motions here in the next couple of days in the committee to get this program that was a bipartisan program moving along,” Born said. 
Certain projects funded in DNR budget, Knowles-Nelson not 
Noticeably missing from the Republicans’ Department of Natural Resource motion was funding for the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program, which allows the agency to fund the purchase of public land and upkeep of recreational areas.
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said lawmakers were missing an opportunity by not funding the program in the budget. 
“There’s a lot of individual pet projects in here that seem to be of interest to individual legislators, but there aren’t a lot of park projects that are of interest to Wisconsinites, particularly Knowles-Nelson,” Andraca said.
The committee approved funding in the budget for an array of projects including $42 million to help with modernization of the Rothschild Dam, $500,000 to go towards the repair of a retaining wall for the Wisconsin Rapids Riverbank project, $2.2 million environmental remediation and redevelopment of Lake Vista Park in Oak Creek, $70,000 for a dredging project in Manitowoc River in the Town of Brillion, $1.75 million for dredging the Deerskin River and $100,000 for assistance with highway flooding in the Town of Norway in Racine County. 
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), who is the author of a bill to keep the program going, said lawmakers are working to ensure it handles the program in the best way, which is part of why the funding is not in the budget as of now. 
“We actually have until 30th of June of 2026 to work on this. It’s something that Sen. [Patrick] Testin and I have been working on along with our staff over the last six months. It’s something that is a bipartisan effort. We’ve met with so many different stakeholders, so many different groups, so many fellow legislators on getting this done,” Kurtz said. “We are committed to get it done.” 
Kurtz said that the hearing on the bill was “good” and there will be “a lot more coming up in the future” when it comes to Knowles-Nelson. 
The committee also approved raising nonresident vehicle admission sticker fees, nonresident campsite fees and campsite electricity fees. 
Office of School Safety, VOCA grants get state funding
The Department of Justice’s Office of School Safety will get 13 permanent staff positions and $1.57 million to continue its work. That’s about $700,000 less than what the agency had requested, but is about what Evers had proposed for the office. 
The office serves as a resource for K-12 schools — helping them improve security measures by providing training on crisis prevention and response, grants for safety enhancements, threat assessment training and mental health training. It also operates the Speak Up, Speak Out tipline where students can anonymously report safety concerns.
The Wisconsin DOJ will also get help filling funding gaps for Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants left by federal funding cuts. 
Wisconsin’s federal allocation for VOCA grants has been cut from $40 million to $13 million. Domestic violence shelters and victim services organizations along with the state DOJ have been navigating the limited funding for over a year. The organizations that receive VOCA grants help people who are the victims of a crime by assisting them with finding housing, providing transportation to and from court appearances and navigating the criminal justice system.
The Republican-approved motion will provide $20 million to cover the federal funding loss. It will also provide $163,500 for two staff positions, which will expire in July 2027. The Wisconsin DOJ had requested an additional $66 million in the budget to make up for the funding gap. 
McGuire noted the funding would be significantly less than what the state agency had requested and would essentially create a two-year program rather than an ongoing one.
“[This] maintains the Legislature’s level of input, but it doesn’t actually maintain the same level of service because of the declining revenues as a result of the federal government,” McGuire said. “While we can’t fix all the things that are the result of what the federal government is doing wrong … this is something that will have an impact on communities across the state. It’s going to have an impact on people who’ve had the worst day and the worst week in the worst month of their life. It’s gonna have an impact on people who have been harmed by violence who have been in toxic, abusive relationships. It’s going to have an impact on people who desperately need services through no fault of their own. These are really vulnerable people and they should receive our support.  
Wisconsin Grants to get slight infusion, UW budget postponed 
The committee did not take up the budget for the University of Wisconsin system. It’s been one of the key issues for debate as Republican lawmakers have considered cuts, while Evers and UW leaders have said the university system needs $855 million in additional funding. Evers has said that in negotiations he and lawmakers were discussing a “positive number.”
The committee did take up the Higher Educational Aids Board, which is the agency responsible for overseeing Wisconsin’s student financial aid system, investing in the Wisconsin Grant Program. The program provides grants to undergraduate Wisconsin residents enrolled at least half-time in degree or certificate programs.
The Wisconsin Grants program would receive an additional $5.6 million in 2025-26 and $11.9 million in 2026-27 under the proposal approved Friday. The UW system, private nonprofit colleges and Wisconsin Technical College System would receive equal dollar increases. It also includes a $75,000 increase for tribal college students.
Evers had proposed 20% increases for the Wisconsin Grants for the state’s public universities, private nonprofit colleges and technical colleges — a total $57.7 million investment.
The Wisconsin Technical Colleges System had requested $10.8 million in each year of the biennium, saying there has been a waitlist for the grants for the first time in 10 years and that list is projected to grow.
The committee also approved $3.5 million in 2026-27 in a supplemental appropriation for emergency medical services training costs to reimburse training and materials costs. 
“Recruiting volunteer EMS personnel is a challenge all over the state of Wisconsin — certainly is in my Senate district,” Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said. “We believe that this will remove one barrier to recruitment of volunteers in our EMS units all across the state.” 
Other portions of the budget approved Friday evening include: 

$30 million to the Tourism Department for general marketing, and an additional $1 million in the second year of the budget, as well as about $113,000 for state arts organizations and two staff positions and funding for the Office of Outdoor Recreation. The motion includes $5 million for Taliesin Preservation Inc. for restoration projects at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin home located in Spring Green supporting private fundraising for an education center, the restoration of visitor amenities and the stabilization of some buildings.
$193,700 to the Wisconsin Elections Commission with over $150,000 of that going toward information technology costs and the remaining going towards costs for the Electronic Registration Information Center.
$20.9 million and 147 positions for 12 months of personnel related costs for a Milwaukee Type 1 facility, which is meant to serve as a portion of the replacement of youth prisons Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, which the state had been working to close for years. The 32-bed facility in Milwaukee has a planned completion date in October 2026.
The WisconsinEye endowment received $10 million to continue video coverage of the Legislature.
The committee also approved $11 million for grants to nine of Wisconsin’s 11 federally-recognized tribes. The committee has been excluding two tribes — the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa — from the grant funding for several years due to disputes over roads. The exclusion “strikes me as inappropriate,” McGuire said. He added that it’s “an insult to those people.”

The worker’s attorneys believe their client was the first of the detained Glenn Valley employees to be released on a bond pending further legal proceedings. Other bond hearings are expected over the next days and weeks, they and other attorneys working with the group said.

The next step for the released foreign-born worker is to build a case for eligibility to remain in the country, said Bassel El-Kasaby, who said attorney Lauren Schmoke in the Kasaby Schmoke law firm represented the person in immigration court proceedings. El-Kasaby said final resolution of such cases can take years, given the court’s backlog.
El-Kasaby said the firm’s client was not charged with a criminal act. He said the client is accused of a civil offense, entering and working in the U.S. without authorization, which can lead to penalties such as deportation. The law firm declined to provide more detail without the client’s consent. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the June 10 operation stemmed from a federal criminal search warrant looking for more than 100 individuals who ICE alleges stole U.S. identities.
According to available federal court records, it appears that so far three of the detained workers have been criminally charged — one for allegedly using a Social Security number of a U.S. citizen. The other two: a Honduran man accused of brandishing a box cutter and resisting arrest; a Mexican man facing charges for re-entering the country after being previously departed.
An ICE spokeswoman said the investigation continues.
Another four people face criminal charges related to protests during the raid.
Anne Wurth, senior attorney at Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said her nonprofit is handling several of the worker cases. She said the bulk will have hearings over the next couple of weeks in immigration court to set a potential bond and future court dates for civil offenses.
“The majority of these people are not facing criminal charges at this time,” she said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.


“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I may be best-known for my battles with pipeline companies, both Summit Carbon’s proposed carbon dioxide pipeline and the Dakota Access oil pipeline. I had the distinction of being named first in the landowners’ lawsuit against Summit’s efforts to force their way onto our land, which wound its way to the state Supreme Court, where we prevailed last year. 
It’s well-established that many South Dakotans do not care for the carbon dioxide pipeline, but the U.S. House’s budget reconciliation bill fails to repeal a massive handout to carbon companies with 45Q tax credits. This corporate welfare is why companies like Summit persist in pushing projects we don’t want. Our lone representative, Congressman Dusty Johnson, voted yes on the bill. It’s now under consideration in the Senate. 
He touted all the reasons this “big, beautiful bill” will be good for South Dakota, but good for whom, exactly? He doesn’t mention billions of dollars in 45Q tax credits at all, but cheerfully explains reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. He seems quite proud of the cuts and work requirements that will leave more South Dakotans hungry and lacking in health care. Not to mention the negative impacts on our grocery stores and small health care facilities. 
Trump urges voters to press for US Senate GOP mega-bill after setback on Medicaid cuts

As a pipeline fighter, folks may be surprised at my concern over cuts to food assistance and health care access, but I taught for over 30 years in our public schools, so I understand how budgets affect people’s lives. I also have direct experience with helping disabled people acquire that designation, and let me tell you, that is a difficult and lengthy process. It may take years for people who are not able to work to be recognized as disabled by the government. These cuts will be devastating for them. 
So when I hear that these budget cuts will help reduce waste and fraud, I call foul. Currently over 75,000 South Dakotans utilize SNAP, so these cuts will be felt everywhere. The work requirements may sound like common sense until you dig in. The cut-off age for a dependent child is 7 years; what this means is that if you are a parent on SNAP, you must work 20 hours per week if your youngest child is 7 or older, whether or not you have child care or how far you have to drive to get to that job. Or even if there is a job to be had.
We all know people’s budgets are tight, and this is reflected by Feeding South Dakota, which has reported a 15% increase in usage over last year. They are already struggling to meet people’s needs, so what will happen if these cuts are implemented? Hunger is what will happen. 
Next, let’s consider our state budget, which had to be trimmed this past legislative session. The U.S. House version of the budget reconciliation bill would make South Dakota absorb a reported $9 million to $18 million in costs shifted to the states as early as 2028 in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Can we tighten our belts that much? 
If all this weren’t enough, let’s look at how health care would be hurt by the Medicaid cuts. Nearly 150,000 South Dakotans are enrolled in Medicaid, and many of these folks are senior citizens and people with disabilities. If fewer people can be covered, our health care facilities will feel the pinch immediately because even though people may not have coverage, they still get sick and injured. 
As for how this will impact hospitals and clinics, this quote from Shelley Ten Napel in South Dakota Searchlight on May 29 says it best: “The proposed cuts will be especially harmful to rural South Dakota. When coverage rates fall, rural health centers lose critical funding – putting access to primary care, maternal care, dental services and behavioral health at risk for everyone in those communities.” 
Thousands of South Dakotans already travel considerable distances for a doctor’s visit, and these cuts will make a bad situation worse if closures start. Plus, those are jobs lost from communities, another blow. 
I don’t think this bill is as beautiful as Rep. Johnson makes it out to be. The pipeline companies got a rosy deal, but it looks pretty ugly for the rest of us.

(Getty Images)As voters prepare to decide who the state’s next governor should be, nearly half of respondents to a new Rutgers-Eagleton Poll say the state is headed in the wrong direction.
The poll found that 48% of residents say New Jersey is on the wrong track compared to 39% who say it is headed in the right direction. Fourteen percent are unsure. 
Results differed widely depending on the respondent’s political party. Sixty-three percent of Democrats said the state is headed in the right direction versus 77% of Republicans saying it’s on the wrong track. Unaffiliated voters are on the pessimistic side, with 48% saying the state is on the wrong track and 32% saying it’s moving in the right direction. 
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is stepping down in January after two terms as governor. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are competing in November to succeed him. 
Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of Rutgers’ Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said the right track/wrong track gap is the widest it’s been since March 2022. A poll from that month found 48% of New Jerseyans saying the state was going in the right direction and 45% saying it had gone off track.
“We’ve kind of seen this very middle-of-the-road kind of malaise of an outlook from New Jerseyans for quite a prolonged period of time now, really dipping down since the pandemic,” Koning told the New Jersey Monitor. 
Predictably, economic issues topped respondents’ concerns when asked about the most important problem facing New Jersey. Thirty-six percent cited taxes and 22% said affordability and the cost of living, while housing affordability and the economy were cited by 8% each. 
The last time New Jersey voters had a governor’s race with no incumbent seeking reelection was 2017, when Murphy was running to succeed Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican wrapping up two terms as governor. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from August 2017 revealed deep dissatisfaction among New Jersey voters, with 74% saying the state was on the wrong track versus 16% who said it was going in the right direction.
Though Sherrill’s campaign has criticized Ciattarelli for being too friendly to President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, and Ciattarelli has griped about overdevelopment of the state’s suburbs, economic issues widely eclipsed both as the most important problem facing New Jersey, the new poll shows. Trump, the federal government, and MAGA ideology were cited by just 3%, with 1% citing overdevelopment.
“Even when we see these critical social issues pop up and become more salient, they’re still, at the end of the day, perhaps not the most important or the biggest driving factor,” Koning said. “That’s how Ciattarelli ended up closing his gap in 2021 as well, by focusing on economic issues, and why the gubernatorial was so close.”
Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021 and came within three points of unseating Murphy.
Results are from a statewide poll of 621 adults selected randomly and surved between June 13 and June 16.

The Legislature plans to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
The post Agreement reached on state budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE LEGISLATURE PLANS to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Sen. Michael Rodrigues, the budget chiefs for each chamber, said in a statement just after 1 p.m. Friday they completed a deal on the annual spending plan. They did not release any details about its contents or even a bottom line spending figure.
Each branch this spring approved a more than $61.4 billion budget, representing a roughly 6 percent increase in state spending over the version Gov. Maura Healey signed last summer.
While the bottom lines were roughly similar, the House and Senate budgets differed on how much money to provide to the MBTA, other education and transportation initiatives funded by a surtax on wealthy households, the use of one-time revenues to support spending, and transfers to the health safety net program.
“With this compromise agreement, the House and Senate are doubling down on our shared commitment to addressing the underlying budget challenges that we are collectively confronting in the face of ongoing uncertainty and federal funding impacts,” Michlewitz and Rodrigues said in a joint statement. “Currently, our teams are working hard to complete the work necessary to file the conference committee report this weekend, to ensure that the Legislature is prepared to act on Monday to send a balanced and fiscally responsible budget to the Governor and her team before the beginning of the new fiscal year.”
Lawmakers also packed the bills with policy riders, and the weekend filing will reveal how they landed on whether to pause admissions reforms at vocational and technical schools, whether to give up some state control over alcohol licenses, and whether regulators can cap prices for some prescription medications.
The House and Senate are largely pressing ahead with spending plans crafted before the extent of changes at the federal level became more apparent.
Final approval of the state budget is now likely to occur before Congress completes its work on a massive spending, tax and policy bill. That legislation remains pending in the US Senate.
If Republicans in Washington, DC, follow through on their goals of cutting spending on Medicaid and other programs, it could force Gov. Maura Healey to make significant changes to the state budget down the line.
Fiscal year 2026 begins Tuesday, July 1. Massachusetts has not had a new state budget signed into law before the start of the fiscal year in a decade and a half.
Michlewitz and Rodrigues’s announcement tees up legislative approval of a new budget on fiscal new year’s eve, though the state is almost certain not to have a spending plan officially in place by the time FY 2026 begins because Healey gets 10 days to review any bill sent to her desk.
Healey on Monday filed a $7.5 billion interim budget designed to keep state government funded, and avoid any lapses in paychecks, programs or services, for about another month in the absence of an annual spending plan. The Legislature broke for a long weekend without taking up that stopgap measure.
Spokespeople for both House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka said Friday their branches will approve the interim budget Monday.
If the Legislature enacts the fiscal 2026 budget Monday as planned, it would be the earliest in the calendar lawmakers sent an annual budget to the governor since 2016, when they also voted on June 30.
House and Senate Democrats for years have extended budget talks into the new fiscal year and kept government funded with holdover budgets, at times producing some of the latest annual budgets in the nation.
The last time a governor signed an annual state budget into law before the start of the fiscal year was in 2010.
The difference in spending between the House and Senate budgets is $70.3 million or about 0.11 percent, the Mass. Taxpayers Foundation said before cautioning that there is also nearly $1 billion in unique spending across the two bills especially in areas like health care, education, support services and economic development.
“The House budget includes $437 million in spending not reflected in the Senate budget, while the Senate budget includes $522 million in spending not adopted by the House,” MTF said in a report last week.
MTF said that the six-person conference committee, should it attempt to fund every dollar called for in the House and Senate budgets, could find itself as much as $769 million short if budget-writers have only MTF’s minimum estimate for budget revenues available to them.
“At a high-level, the House and Senate budgets share many similarities that would ordinarily suggest swift conference resolution: both bills exclude the tax policy proposals put forward by the administration, spend less than the Governor by at least $500 million, and reflect a limited number of substantive policy proposals,” the report said. “However, despite these shared elements, budget conferees are still tasked with reconciling nearly $1 billion in unique spending priorities, a resource gap that could exceed $750 million, and notable policy differences related to pharmaceutical cost controls and admissions policies at vocational technical high schools.”
The budget deal is the first piece of legislation subject to newly reformed joint rules the House and Senate adopted Thursday. One provision in the new package requires a gap of at least 24 hours between the filing of a conference report and acceptance of it in the House and Senate, which would require the budget deal to be submitted to the House clerk’s office by about Sunday afternoon for action to take place Monday.
Under the new rules, if a report is filed later than 8 p.m. though, it cannot be considered the following day.

My first encounter with Montana Congressman Pat Williams was at a political event I was covering in Pocatello, Idaho in the early 1980s.
Williams, who died this week in Missoula, Montana at age 87, was speaking at that event. He delivered the best political stump speech I had ever heard.
I haven’t heard a better one since. It was an unabashed defense of enduring democratic values – respect for the Constitution, defense of a liberal education, support for working women and men and organized labor, an affirmation that good people in government can and must do good works.
It is said that Montana, a state I love for its beauty, its people and (until recently) its determinedly independent political nature, is really a small town with a very long Main Street. If you spend some time under the Big Sky you come to believe that virtually everyone in the fourth largest (by square mile) state in the Union knows everyone else. And it’s almost true.
Driving 200 miles to have dinner with friends or to watch a football game is pretty routine in Montana. Voters (until recently) knew their governor, U.S. senators and congressmen on a first name basis because those Montanans showed up to knock on doors, eat chicken dinners, hold town hall meetings and give local reporters interviews.
That has changed. A lot.
Pat Williams’ passing reminds me of just how much things have changed, and damn it is not for the better in any way.
Pat Williams was among the very last of a breed of Montana congressional figures who knew more about their state than they knew about Georgetown, and by that I mean the neighborhood in the District of Columbia and not the spot on the map of Deer Lodge County.
Mike Mansfield, the best Senate majority leader in history, was just “Mike” to his Montana constituents. Mansfield campaigned in coffee shops and held office hours in the Oxford in Missoula.
“Lee” was the champion of the Wilderness Act and presided over the Senate during the filibuster that tried, unsuccessfully, to defeat the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Senator Metcalf, appropriately, has a Wilderness area that carries his name.
“Max” was the guy who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and served in the Senate longer than any other Montanan. For decades Senator Baucus shaped fiscal and health care policy and then, like Mansfield, had a second act as a U.S. ambassador to Asia.
There are many others: B.K. Wheeler, a Montanan who lead the fight to prevent the Supreme Court from becoming Franklin Roosevelt’s court; Tom Walsh, the investigator of Teapot Dome from Helena; Jeannette Rankin, an advocate for women and peace who hailed from Missoula, and Jim Murray, a millionaire New Deal liberal from Butte whose political devotion was to Montana’s miners and farmers.
Until partisan polarization poisoned Montana’s politics just as it has poisoned the country, Big Sandy farmer Jon Tester, as authentic and decent as any of those just noted, was the last best Montana federal office holder in this long and now gone tradition.
  Now let us praise Pat Williams 

Pat once told me he caught more political grief for advocating changing the name of the Custer Battlefield than anything he did in Congress, but he did it. Pat, a student of history and hyper sensitive to injustice, didn’t think the racist loser in that celebrated battle deserved the honor. Now we call it the Little Bighorn.
We take it for granted now, but the Family and Medical Leave Act likely would not have happened without Pat Williams shifting the legislative gears.
He advocated for the arts and humanities when Newt Gingrich – echos of today – came after the national endowments, arguing that art and ideas could exist without democracy but democracy was imperiled when creativity and critical thinking where ignored. Pat saw the effort to eliminate the endowments for just what it was, and what it is again – censorship.
Interviewed by The Washington Post, Pat characterized the struggle to pass compromise legislation to save federal funding for the arts in the 1990s as “the most nasty, difficult and thoroughly enjoyable of my life.”
Pat said of that fight:

        Art reflects the diversity and pluralism of our society, which is free. And freedom is our bulwark against tyranny. You can burn a generation’s imagination by teaching them that art is something to fear.    
As Democrats wander in the political wilderness trying to figure out how to “appeal” to distracted, disinterested voters, they might go to school on the politics of Pat Williams. He listened. He showed up. He cared. He knew what he believed.
“He was always his authentic self,” pollster Celinda Lake said. “He told me, ‘I want you to know my goals. I’m engaged in a 20-year conversation with the people of Montana about the benefits of good public education and the dangers of hard-rock mining.’ And I’ll never forget that.”
Like so many politicians who have tasted the bitter fruit of what our politics have become, Williams knew that big money and poll tested positions are a huge problem. In a 1996 interview with the New York Times he put his finger squarely on our dangerous national dilemma.

“People have come to believe their elected officials and their candidates are not the real McCoy. They’re not authentic, they’re scripted, talking according to the polls, voting according to next November … It’s cancerous to our system.”
 

Williams wasn’t bashful about advocating for the public’s lands and cleaner environment. 
He knew from experience as a teacher and elected official that education was still the best and surest path to a better life. He wrote well, really well. Pat’s sense of humor – he was from Butte and had to have a sense of humor – was legendary. He was the best political story teller I’ve ever shared a dinner and a drink with.
When my much better half was working on her doctorate – her subject was women and leadership – Pat enthusiastically supported her research, and every single time I called him or shared a handshake and a hug he would say, “And, how is Dr. Johnson?”
Years ago the journalist turned U.S. Sen. Richard Neuberger wrote an essay about a now long forgotten politician who gained power and fame and then couldn’t remember where he came from. As Neuberger told the story he got off a train, the City of Portland, to stretch his legs and asked the ticket agent how he could locate a former politician he’d once known.
“Heck mister,” the man said, “he don’t live here any more. Those guys never come back to Pocatello.”
But Pat did come back – to Montana. He taught and the University of Montana, and researched, and mentored and spoke out about issues big and small. He never caught the fever associated with the Potomac, instead preferring the Clark Fork. He loved and cared about Montana, all of it.
About the only truly bad thing I can say about Pat Williams is that he was a fan of the New York Yankees, admittedly a small blemish on a thoroughly distinguished resume.
There is a lot to be said for decency and authenticity in public life. A lot to be said for knowing what you stand for and then having the guts to explain why to the people who vote.
These increasingly rare qualities defined the gentleman from Montana. Finding another like him under the Big Sky seems now all but impossible, but I suspect Pat, with the optimism of a guy from Butte, would say: Keep the faith, do the work, show up and care.
God, I will miss him. I will never forget Pat Williams and all he did. We are very lucky that he made us all better.

,California,2025-06-28 13:10:00+00:00,CalMatters,Marines are now stationed on the California border. Newsom’s office calls it ‘mission creep’,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/06/marines-border-patrol/,"As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it's sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border.","In summary
As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it’s sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border. 


Dozens of Marines are now stationed at a Border Patrol station in eastern San Diego County, a new development that points to the Trump administration’s military buildup on the southern border.
Some Marines there told CalMatters on Wednesday that they are out in Campo patrolling the border twice a day.  
That’s a change from how Marines have operated in Southern California since President Trump took office. Until now, Marines have been limited to a supporting role, adhering to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which keeps the armed forces away from civilian law enforcement. 
But Trump has long hinted at using the armed forces in unprecedented ways at the border to deal with what he describes as “an invasion.” 
And recently, the Trump administration shifted immigration enforcement northward toward the interior of California. Border Patrol agents have been seen chasing farmworkers through strawberry fields in Oxnard and swarming workers in unmarked cars at bus stops in inner-city Los Angeles.  
The Marines have not disclosed detaining anyone in California. Active-duty Army soldiers patrolling the border in New Mexico earlier this month reported turning people over to immigration authorities, a change that illustrated escalating immigration enforcement by military service members. 
A spokesperson for the Joint Task Force Southern Border, in charge of the operation, did not return a request for comment. Border Patrol Agent Gerardo Gutierrez said the Marines “are just staging there for their assistance along the border,” and gave no further details. 
California officials and immigration experts do not have details on what the Marines are doing at the border.  
“It’s not clear to me what instructions the Marines are being given with respect to engagement with people who are attempting to cross the border,” said Kevin Johnson, a UC Davis School of Law professor whose work focuses on immigration and civil rights. 
In April, Trump declared a 60-foot-wide strip of federal land that runs the length of the entire border as a “military installation,” a status meant to allow troops to patrol the region in the same way they protect military bases.

On a recent trip to the Border Patrol site in Campo, CalMatters reporters observed Marines’ olive-colored tents pitched atop hot asphalt with nearby water tanks for brushing teeth and washing. They have a pile of MREs, or “meals-ready-to-eat,” for food. 
Their camp is a couple of hundred yards from the start of the Pacific Coast Trail — a stone’s throw from the U.S.-Mexico border. The area is very remote.
Newsom sued to stop LA deployments
Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom clashed with Trump over the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles and deployment of U.S. Marines to subdue protesters, calling it “an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.” Newsom sued the administration, but a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the president had followed the law and the case is unfolding at a lower court. 
A spokesperson for Newsom in a written statement to CalMatters connected the Marines at Campo to the Trump administration sending Border Patrol agents hundreds of miles inland.
“We believe in strong border security, but this campaign is not about security—it’s about fear,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo of Newsom’s office. 
“Now it appears Marines are being forced to backfill those border slots,” she continued. “This is not just mission creep—it’s putting law enforcement, our soldiers, and the community in danger.”
The military presence in Campo, previously unreported, follows an earlier deployment of roughly 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton, who had been positioned in the small coastal town of Imperial Beach and in an inland border area near Brown Field Airport in Otay Mesa. According to the Department of Defense, those troops are tasked with “detection, monitoring, logistics, and transportation support along the border.” 
Over the last three decades, the border has become one of the most militarized regions in the world, with stronger, more formidable, and taller border barriers and increased surveillance. Migrant deaths have increased as people sought more dangerous routes in the U.S., the Mexican government reported last month.
How Trump’s border mission differs from others
When he took office, Trump issued a series of executive orders, including a national emergency declaration, to achieve what he described as “full operational control” of the southern border. The orders directed the Department of Defense, through U.S. Northern Command, to bolster border enforcement through increased military involvement. 
Some legal experts say turning land along the border into a “military installation” may sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically bars federal armed forces from conducting domestic law enforcement.

“There’s a concern that armed troops may use deadly force in situations and that people may be injured,” said Johnson, adding that military forces don’t have experience dealing with vulnerable migrants, and it’s not clear what training they’ve received. 
“It’s like a ticking time bomb,” he added. “I hate to say it this way, but it’s only a matter of time until we see something bad happen.” 
This isn’t the first time U.S. troops have been sent to the border. The Department of Defense has deployed troops to the border under both Republican and Democratic administrations for construction and surveillance.  But until now, their role has been limited to conducting surveillance, repairing vehicles, and fortifying barriers. 
The latest wave of deployments brings the total number of military personnel supporting the Border Patrol’s mission at the Mexico border to more than 10,000 – adding to the approximately 2,500 who were already stationed along the entire length of the 2,000-mile border. The number of troops at the border fluctuates as the units rotate and additional forces are mobilized, according to the Defense Department.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062525-Marines-Camp-AD-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-28 10:01:09.422113

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYO. – Sitting in an old-growth spruce fir forest, Doug Smith says he can see first-hand the impact of reintroducing wolves on the larger ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park.

Long before Yellowstone became the world’s first national park in 1872, wolves thrived in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
But early Yellowstone rangers killed off the last of the park’s wolves by 1926. By the late 1930s, the federal government had basically eradicated all the wolves in the American West.
That fundamentally changed the ecosystem, as far as Smith is concerned.
“To me it was just pretty scenery because it wasn’t ecologically vibrant,” Smith said.
Then, in 1995, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Idaho and Yellowstone using wolves captured in Canada.
Smith helped bring them back to the park and was in charge of Yellowstone’s wolf project for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Yellowstone is a very different place, with and without wolves,” Smith said.
“Wolves definitely have changed this landscape with the help of other predators,” he added. “It’s very different.”
Many of the changes have to do with the wolves’ status as an apex predator, at the top of the food chain. With the loss of wolves and the decline of other predators like cougar and grizzly bears, elk populations surged, Smith said.

Without the threat of wolves throughout much of the 20th century, the elk devoured woody vegetation in Yellowstone, like willows and stands of white bark Aspen trees.
When wolves were reintroduced, they preyed on elk, which reduced the number of elk and put pressure on the remaining animals to keep moving and not graze as long or as heavily in one place.
“I go to willow stands and aspen stands now that I was in 30 years ago, and literally, every single stem was eaten by an elk, and it was at the level of your knee,” Smith said. “And now I go in those stands, and you can lose your partner in them in regrowth of vegetation within 10 feet.”
Scientists debate an effect called the trophic cascade, which deals with how ecosystems are constructed and describes the cascading impact a predator has on its prey further down the food chain.
“Why it’s interesting is when European settlers moved across North America, they killed all the predators,” Smith said. “So you’ve really disrupted this process of a trophic cascade.”
Smith said the debate over the effects of the trophic cascade gets complicated – quickly. He himself falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to buying into the impact and intensity of the effect. But as Smith backpacked near Cache Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone, he said the impact of wolves and other predators is easy to spot.
“You guys don’t have to be ecologists to see all these Aspen are young,” Smith said. “Within a few years – and, man, give them 20 or 30 (years) – you’re going to have a forest here, and we’re going to be standing in the shade. Totally different ballgame, and I think that’s restoring balance to the ecosystem.”
When vegetation grows back, as the aspen and willows grow tall, that impacts things like beaver populations, which Smith has documented, and even songbirds.
The big picture for Smith? Wolves restored balance that was missing from Yellowstone’s ecosystem when the predators were absent.
“It’s a nice story, too,” Smith said. “We ruined Yellowstone. We’re fixing it by bringing back the top carnivores, most notably wolves.”
Truth be told, most Yellowstone visitors have likely never heard of the trophic cascade or deeply  considered the wolves’ impact on the food chain and the larger ecosystem.
But like the ecosystem, wolves have a powerful effect on many people, too.
Reintroducing wolves also attracted a new crop of tourists hoping to see a wolf in the wild. And that has had a cascading effect on the local economy.
Wolf-watching tourism has an estimated $80 million total economic impact on the communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park.
Any visitor to the wolves’ stronghold in the park, the Lamar Valley, can see the impact in the many tourists dotting hillsides looking through binoculars and spotting scopes hoping to spot canis lupus in the wild.
And one wolf, in particular, fascinated wolf watchers for longer than almost any other.
 907: the one-eyed queen of Yellowstone wolves

Even from a great distance, the old wolf’s large size and limp gave her identity away.
Gray, with a black nose, white legs, a cream-colored belly and a black spot near the base of her tail, wolf 907F stood out from the pack.
907’s physical scars told the silent story of the struggles wolves endure fighting for control of the rugged Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park.
Aside from a limp in her front paw, 907 was missing her left eye, the result of an injury park officials first noticed in 2017.

“Whatever tragedy, setback or loss she has, she just keeps on moving forward,” said Rick McIntyre, a retired Yellowstone National Park ranger and author who has studied 907’s pack since it formed.

“Nothing (stops her) – not health problems, getting beat up by a rival, the loss of her mother, the loss of her father, loss of pups,” McIntyre said.
Nobody in the world has seen more wolves in the wild than McIntyre.
He started working at Yellowstone in 1994 as an interpretive wolf ranger and documented his 100,000th wolf sighting in 2019.
Because he has 30 years of experience documenting wolves on a nearly daily basis, it takes a lot for a wolf to stand out to McIntyre.

But 907 accomplished something rare.
She was able to rise to the rank of alpha female four separate times and control one of the largest wolf packs ever documented in Yellowstone. And while she was at it, 907  gave birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone and outlasted her rivals long enough to grow old in the wild.
In 2024, 907 turned 11 years old and continued to lead hunts for bison and elk as the oldest wolf in the national park.
By comparison, the average wolf lives for about three or four years in Yellowstone, McIntyre said. Even pet dogs that sleep indoors, receive veterinary care and have a bowl of food waiting for them twice a day don’t always make it to 11.
Because of her longevity and the fact that researchers put a radio collar on her when she was a pup, Yellowstone biologists and wolf watchers were able to study 907 so closely for so long that there are detailed numbers and statistics documenting much of her life.
For her to reach the age of 11, 907 had to defend her territory from rival wolves and endure 10 snowy, freezing Wyoming winters. She had to fight for most of her meals – sometimes getting kicked in the head by 2,000-pound bison and sent flying through the air.
Her stats are a snapshot of the turbulent life wild wolves face. Throughout her life, Yellowstone National Park staff watched 907 participate in 566 hunts.
Most of the time she chased bison (281 hunts) or elk (239 times).
She was successful 33 times, or in about 6% of the hunts that park officials documented.
Yellowstone officials once watched 907 and the Junction Butte Pack endure 12 days without finding anything to eat – only for the pack to triumphantly bring down a bull elk on empty stomachs.
When it comes to numbers, the biggest impact 907 may have had was building up the bloodline of Yellowstone wolves.
In 2024, at the age of 11, she produced her 10th litter of pups.
That is the most for any wolf in 30 years of wolf research at Yellowstone National Park.
“With her being 11 years old and having new pups that would be somewhat similar to a woman in her mid 80s having kids,” McIntyre said.
Numbers even tell the story of how 907 got her name.
When Yellowstone officials captured 907 and placed a radio collar around her neck in 2013, she got collar No. 907.
Each collar has a unique number to help identify and tell the wolves apart. Biologists use the “F” in 907F to designate her as female, but many people simply called her 907.
The collar allowed park officials to keep close tabs on 907 for more than a decade.
Many of the numbers and statistics about 907 can be found online in the 2024 Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar and Elk Project annual report, as well as previous yearly wolf reports.
 The chance to observe a wolf queen’s long reign attracts tourists to Yellowstone National Park

Wolf 907 and the Junction Butte Pack’s territory spanned mountains, valleys and creeks within an area called the Lamar Valley, which is in the northern part of Yellowstone National Park on the Wyoming-Montana border. It’s one of the centers of wildlife activity in the park.
For years, 907 dug her den into a hillside covered by a mix of sagebrush and conifer trees overlooking Slough Creek, where 907 and her pack hunted bison and elk.



On a chilly July morning in 2024, the creek meandered through a giant meadow below the den, where bison wallowed as the morning sun crested the nearby mountain peaks.
The den was a mile or more from the closest road, near the top of a diagonal section of forest.
Toward the left side of the forest, barely visible to the naked eye from more than a mile away, stood four small clusters of conifer trees.
At the base of one of the trees, near a patch of light colored dirt, 907 wrestled with two pups, one gray and one black
Unbeknownst to 907, she was often the object of attention from afar.
And on that morning in July a handful of people with high-powered scopes were watching her every move.
One of the wolf watchers was Laurie Lyman, a schoolteacher originally from California.

Lyman became interested in wolves after realizing that third and fourth graders became more interested in learning about continents if Lyman described the animals that lived there.
One year, Lyman received a copy of Jim Dutcher’s 1997 Emmy Award-winning documentary “Wolves at Our Door,” which Lyman and her students promptly fell in love with.
Something about wolves – how they live in packs that function like a family, where all of the wolves help raise the pups, contribute to hunting and share food – made an immediate impression on Lyman.
Within wolf packs, including 907’s own Junction Butte Pack, biologists have even documented one wolf raising another wolf’s pups. One spring, 907 had a litter of eight pups. Other female members of the Junction Butte Pack who lost their own litters helped 907 raise her large litter  – even taking turns nursing the pups.
Before reintroduction, Lyman was fascinated by the ways the members of wolf packs worked together to take care of each other.
But wolves had been absent from the landscape in the U.S. Rocky Mountains for her entire life, and Lyman assumed she would never see a wolf in the wild.
That’s how wolf reintroduction changed Lyman’s life.
After wolves were reintroduced in 1995, Lyman started hearing about people seeing wild wolves again and she made a trip to see what it was all about.
“When they released them into Yellowstone, when they started to see them, it was incredible, and that was the changing point in my life,” Lyman said.
Lyman retired from teaching in 2005 and bought a house in Montana just outside of Yellowstone’s Northeast Entrance to be closer to wolves.
She became friends with then-Yellowstone Ranger Rick McIntyre and purchased a spotting scope. And for the past 20 years, Lyman has been watching wolves and documenting her sightings online at www.yellowstonereports.com.
Now, she thinks of wolves and wolf packs a lot like students and classrooms.
“It’s very similar to actually teaching my kids, watching the wolves out,” Lyman said. “It’s like watching a recess. Because you have the adults sleeping. And you have the yearlings playing.  And you have the pups and it’s very much like kids in a sandbox, kids playing soccer. And then the older kids sitting in the lunch center talking.”
“My thing is getting to know them on an individual basis, so that I can easily recognize them,” Lyman added.
 If you come at the queen, you best not miss

Thanks to their notes and years of daily field observations, McIntyre and Lyman have major details of 907’s life documented.
Even as a pup, 907 didn’t have it easy.
She was born in 2013, the second year of the Junction Butte Pack’s existence. Before the year was over, 907’s mother died or disappeared, McIntyre said. About that same time, 907’s father, wolf 911, took off, returning to the original wolf pack that he had been born into.
“In human terms, you could say that she was orphaned,” McIntyre said. “However, she was raised by the pack, raised by the family.”
After she became an adult, 907 fought with her twin sister, wolf 969, for control of the Junction Butte Pack.
The two sisters regularly pinned each other to the ground and bit at each other, Lyman said.
“And they went back and forth several times on who had the alpha female position,” McIntyre said. “907 would have it for a while, the sister would take it away from her and then 907 would get it back.”
In 2017, 907 had a litter of pups and made her den in a remote location away from the rest of the Junction Butte Pack.
Park officials and wolf watchers noticed that the other adults in the pack stayed away from the den and didn’t appear to bring food to 907 or her pups.
In May, 907 returned to the pack, but her pups had died.
“And to make it worse, while she was desperately trying to save her pups, her sister at the time, 969, took advantage of that situation to seize the alpha position,” McIntyre said. “And when 907 rejoined the pack after losing all of her pups, she was beaten up by her sister and relegated to a very lowly position in the pack.”
“Everything that year was against her,” McIntyre said.
Even though she was relegated to a subordinate role, 907 didn’t leave the pack.
“She just has this ability to keep on moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past, dwelling on how unfair life has been,” McIntyre said.
During the 2019-20 winter, the Junction Butte Pack experienced a bloody leadership shakeup.
The female wolves aggressively drove 969 – 907’s sister and rival – out of the pack.
Wolf 969 survived her initial expulsion, but park officials noticed she appeared to be in poor physical condition.
A few weeks after her exile, 969 encountered the Junction Butte Pack again one January night, leading to a fight.
“The next morning 969F was seen with injuries and she died later that day,” officials wrote in the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 2020 annual report. “Her injuries were caused by other wolves and she weighed only 33 kilograms (73 pounds).”
Even after her sister and closest rival was killed, 907 continued to face challenges from rival female wolves.
First, it was her sister’s daughter, wolf 1382, who became a problem for 907.
Then wolf 1262 took over as the pack’s alpha female.
Finally it was wolf 1276.
But after 1276 was last seen alive in October 2023, 907 again took her crown as the Junction Butte Pack’s alpha female.
“And this is her fourth term as alpha female, meaning that she lost it three times,” McIntyre said. “And in those cases, it was either to a sister or a niece. So she’s had a lot of hard times in her life, and she’s always been able to fight back and prevail.”
From 2016 to 2024, 907 claimed the rank of alpha female four separate times.
And she gave birth to pups every spring from 2015 to 2024.

For those reasons, Lyman views 907 as the stabilizing force in the Junction Butte Pack and one of her favorite wolves of all time.
“She would just put her head down and walk into the wind no matter what adversity came to her,” Lyman said.
 Ambushed in the dark, a queen makes her last stand in Yellowstone

Despite her long rivalry with her sister, it turns out 907’s greatest threat came from outside her own pack.
It was just before Christmas 2024 when 907 made her last stand.
During the final few weeks of 2024, the Junction Butte Pack left the invisible, unfenced boundary of Yellowstone National Park and entered Montana, where hunting season was underway.
From Dec. 17 through Dec. 19, hunters legally killed two other adult members of the Junction Butte Pack outside of the park, Yellowstone officials wrote.
After the shootings, 907 and some of the surviving members of the Junction Butte Pack returned to their home territory in the Lamar Valley inside of Yellowstone.

But the Junction Butte Pack’s numbers were reduced. Lyman said there were only six other wolves with 907 when the final battle went down – and one or two of them may have been pups.

A much larger force of 19 wolves from a different wolf pack, the Rescue Creek Pack, ambushed 907 and the Junction Butte Pack on Dec. 22 after wolf watchers spotted the diminished Junction Butte Pack feeding on an animal carcass.
The attack occurred at night.
Lyman wasn’t there, but she received a phone call from a friend who was.
“She was filming and her camera lights things up so she could see things pretty well,” Lyman said. “She called me and she said, ‘You know, it’s over. They got her.’”
The radio collar 907 was wearing was designed to enter mortality mode and emit a unique signal after several hours passed without any movement from the wolf. Officials didn’t detect a mortality signal from 907 until about three days after the attack, Lyman said.

Lyman was heartbroken thinking about 907 suffering at the end.
It may be impossible to know exactly what went down in the dark woods after the Rescue Creek Pack advanced on 907 and the Junction Butte Pack.
But this much seems certain.
907 went out fighting.
She died fighting a larger, rival wolf pack that had attacked her and the Junction Butte Pack – the family she lived with her entire life with.
No other members of the Junction Butte Pack died in the attack from the Rescue Creek wolves.
That means 907’s pack, including some of her pups and nieces, lived on without her.
Strange as it sounds, Lyman takes comfort in that.
Despite the sadness, people like Lyman were happy that 907 lived and died naturally, as wolves did before humans became a factor.
At least 907 wasn’t shot by hunters, like 15 other members of the Junction Butte Pack who were killed when they strayed outside of the park’s boundaries, Lyman said.
The same week 907 died, her counterpart, the alpha male of the Junction Butte Pack, was killed by a poacher. The alpha male, who did not have a number or a radio collar, was killed Dec. 24, while the wolf was outside of Yellowstone National Park, in Montana.
After living to be the fifth-oldest wolf ever recorded in Yellowstone and having more litters of pups than any Yellowstone wolf since the species was reintroduced 30 years ago, 907 went out fighting.
“This is a wolf in the wild, and this is what wolves do,” Lyman said. “They’re wired to rise to the top to survive, and this is what they have to do to do it.”
“She just did what she had to do to make sure that her pack survived,” Lyman said. “So to me, she is a key to the Junctions surviving until now. And her legacy is in those three females that are left there in the pack.”
That’s one of the gifts of a wolf, Lyman said.
“Just like a regular family does, you pass down what you know and help them learn to survive. And she really did that.”

Poll findings released this week from Glengarrif Group showed that eight in 10 voters – from a sample size of 800 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.5% – felt that the upcoming election to select the three top heads of state; governor, attorney general and secretary of state, would be equally secure and fair. 
The results of the poll, which was conducted during the first week of June, were released in conjunction with an event on Thursday at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. The panel featured members of the Democracy Defense Project, including two former Michigan governors, a former congressman and others.
Glengarrif Group noted that nearly 76% of Michigan voters said the November 2024 election was fair, and that 88% of voters said they trusted their local elections, which is a 10-percentage point increase from those who answered a related poll in October 2024.
That said, nearly 57% of voters who engaged with the poll said they were at least somewhat concerned about noncitizens voting in state elections, with nearly 36% also saying they were very concerned about that issue.
Only 21% of respondents, however, said voters should show an ID to vote, which is already required by Michigan law, and a slim 7.7% said voters should show proof of citizenship.
That polling on some voters’ feelings on citizenship as a prerequisite to vote serves as a counterpoint to Michigan Republican efforts to get a constitutional amendment requiring proof of citizenship in order to cast a ballot.
The lead sponsor of that movement is state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford), who told Michigan Advance in late May that he believed 85% of the state’s population agreed that only U.S. citizens should vote in statewide and national elections.
That said, Posthumus’ aim was to put that question before the voters in 2026, giving the voting populace a chance to say whether they believed only U.S. citizens should vote in Michigan’s elections. It is still an open question if a large enough group of Michigan voters want to make that a constitutional requirement.
At Thursday’s forum to announce the poll findings, former Democratic Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard said the state’s residents should be proud of the professionalism of local election workers, regardless of the political outcome.
“As with any election, people will have strong feelings about the outcome and the winners,” Blanchard said. “One thing our poll clearly shows is that despite those feelings, Michigan voters are confident in our election system, especially the work of our local and county-level officials and the many hardworking volunteers who provide support at precincts in communities across Michigan.”
Former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler also said that the state’s voters appear overwhelmingly satisfied with existing election processes. Engler went on to say that more education was needed to bring them up to speed on what measures are already in place to ensure secure and safe elections.
“In the past few years, we have seen clerks from both parties actively engaging voters from all backgrounds in their communities – Republicans, Democrats and independents,” Engler said. “At the same time, local media outlets have covered these events and supported civic public education that benefits all of us, and we encourage them to build on these efforts.”
Engler’s comments come at a time when some Republican state lawmakers remain committed to pushing the falsehood that the 2020 and 2022 elections were unfair and are working to relitigate the outcome of those elections despite recent polls like the Glengarrif offering and other assurances through the years.
Former Lt. Gov. John Cherry, a Democrat, said the Glengarrif poll was striking because it was the first time polling has been done where a majority of voters from all backgrounds said they were satisfied with the 2024 results and looked confidently ahead to 2026 – all while acknowledging that existing safeguards were working.
“Where voters say they want to see changes, that list is very narrow,” Cherry said. “We believe that by working together, in a bipartisan way, Michigan policymakers can find reasonable, commonsense and cost-effective ways to address voters’ concerns.” 
Former Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Bishop of Rochester said the poll was evidence that voters of all political leanings wanted to be in the driver’s seat for local, state and national elections, and not politicians in Lansing.
That said, Bishop did say he believed that the proof of citizenship responses in an open-ended portion of the poll shows there is an appetite to move that measure across the finish line.
​​“Voters also have a real desire to ensure only U.S. citizens vote in our elections, and we encourage policymakers to explore solutions that keep our elections secure without putting up barriers that may prevent any eligible voter from exercising their right to vote,” Bishop said. 
Board members of the Democracy Defense Project proposed a solution to that conundrum: expand and support voter access to Michigan Enhanced IDs and driver’s licenses. Both forms of enhanced identification indicate if someone is a U.S. citizen and are compliant with new federal requirements for REAL ID, which allow access to federal buildings, boarding planes and traveling domestically by air and other activities. 
In late May, the Michigan Department of State said it had issued 200,000 REAL IDs in the last few months.
A REAL ID differs from Enhanced ID in that it does not indicate U.S. citizenship, so a pathway to getting the latter could ease citizenship and voting concerns.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Democracy-vote-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

Mike Dunleavy discusses proposed education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vetoed a bill that would have limited high interest rates and fees for payday loans of $25,000 or less, which advocates said would have protected against predatory lending. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 39, passed both the Alaska House and Senate this session, and would have removed payday lenders from a state exemption in lending laws, and placed a cap on interest rates and fees at an annual percentage rate of 36% for customers paying back these loans. Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans often for small amounts that are meant to be repaid on the borrower’s next payday.
In a short memo issued with the veto on Wednesday, Dunleavy cited access to credit and compliance requirements, issues argued by opponents of the measure.
“These changes would reduce short-term credit options – particularly for those without access to traditional banking services – while creating enforcement challenges for the state,” Dunleavy wrote. 
The veto was condemned by a sponsor of the bill.
“I’m very disappointed in the veto. This was a bipartisan bill,” said Rep. Ted Eischeid, D-Anchorage, who introduced the bill in the House, in a phone interview on Friday. He pointed to the fact that payday loans are highly convenient and accessible online, leaving borrowers with high-interest loans that they struggle to repay. 
“It’s easy to get these payday lending loans. But the problem is, people get the loans. They have two weeks to pay them off. They’re charged fees plus interest rates, and oftentimes they can’t pay those,” he said. “They create debt traps.”
Interest rates and fees in Alaska can range from 194% to 521%, according to research by the Alaska Public Interest Research Group. Eischeid noted 18 other states have enacted a cap on interest rates and fees at 36% annual percentage rate, and other banks lending institutions provide emergency loans. “Those states, red and blue, have not had credit crises,” he said.
In 2023, there were 7,085 Alaskans that took out payday loans totaling $17.4 million, according to the state’s Division of Banking and Securities, with loans averaging $440 and each borrower taking out an average of 5.5 loans. 
Eischeid said Alaskans are also targeted by lenders, who can garnish their Permanent Fund dividend checks. “And so when Alaskans can’t pay these debt trap loans, the payday lenders simply go to small claims court and garnish their PFDs,” he said. “It’s a cash cow for payday lenders.”
From 2017 to 2023, payday lenders garnished over $3.7 million from Alaskan’s PFDs, according to court data compiled by Eischeid’s office. 
He said he wished Dunleavy had identified enforcement concerns earlier, as his office worked with the Division of Banking and Securities in drafting the bill to identify any potential issues. “Because we asked, ‘What kind of heartburn is this going to cause the state in terms of enforcement and regulation?’ And they said none,” he said. “I’m confused by that.” 
The Online Lenders Alliance, a national trade organization for financial technology groups that offer online banking services, applauded Dunleavy’s veto. “Governor Dunleavy made the right choice for Alaska consumers by vetoing this flawed legislation,” said the group’s CEO Andrew Duke in an emailed statement. “The ability to access credit is the cornerstone of financial independence and stability.  Unfortunately, SB 39 would have taken away credit options and financial choices for Alaskan consumers and small businesses.” 
The Alaska Public Interest Research Group criticized the veto, saying it’s a failure to protect Alaskans from predatory lending. “This bill is a commonsense, multipartisan effort to end a debt trap that has harmed our communities for over 20 years,” said Claire Estelle Lubke, AKPIRG economic justice lead, in an email. “Instead of siding with Alaskans, the Governor chose to protect an industry that profits from financial insecurity. Payday loans are not an acceptable form of credit for our communities.”
The group is calling for the Legislature to vote to override veto next January and limit what they call a predatory loan industry. 
Eischeid said it’s a possibility. “​​Those discussions have to happen yet. But it’s a good bill, it was a good bill. It works in states where they’ve gotten rid of the special treatment payday lenders get. And I would like to see this effort be successful.”

(Photo courtesy Maryland Municipal League/CGI)Pocomoke City Mayor Todd Nock wants to take the Maryland Municipal League “back to the future.”
Nock, who took over presidency of the league this week, made the comments after being handed the gavel by Frederick Mayor Michael O’Connor, the outgoing president. In his first speech as president, Nock reminisced about his younger self and about the people who nurtured him, before challenging his fellow mayors and city leaders to work to develop the next generation of leaders.
“This year, Maryland Municipal League is going back to the future. Back to our communities. Back to building the next generation of leaders,” Nock said, according to text of his speech provided by the league. “We’re going to be present. We’re going to show up.
Because here’s the reality—we won’t be elected forever. Our job is to prepare, teach, and nurture not just our youth but also support our elders and entire communities,” he said. “It is time to go back home and be who the people elected us to be.”
Nock went on to tell the municipal officials assembled in Ocean City for the league’s annual summer conference that he did not want to be in their communities just “when you polish statues and cut ribbons. I want to be there when you’re hosting community events, when you’re connecting with residents, and when you’re doing the hard work that truly matters.”
Nock will serve a one-year term as president. While he was elevated to the presidency Tuesday, Bladensburg Mayor Takisha James was elected to replace his as president-elect, and will serve once Nock’s term ends.
Dashboard data targets gun violence
The Maryland Department of Health launched new data on gun violence statistics that health officials say will help track trends in gun violence and find solutions to reduce those numbers.
“As someone who has served as a surgeon in emergency departments in Maryland, I have personally seen how Maryland families and communities suffer from the impact of gun violence and its resulting trauma,” Health Secretary Meena Seshamani told reporters Thursday. “Our ultimate goal with these resources is to develop … data-driven solutions that will save the next life, that will protect the next family and that will heal our communities,” she said.

	The dashboard includes a decade of fatal and nonfatal shooting statistics, updated monthly to have “almost a real-time assessment of what gun violence looks like at the state, county and ZIP code level,” Seshamani said. It also includes the number of homicides and suicides related to firearm use.
From Jan. 1 through April, there had been 187 deaths due to firearms, according to the dashboard. About 54% of those deaths were suicides.
In addition to the dashboard, the department released a preliminary state plan to develop a public health approach to lower gun violence. Besides incorporating dashboard data, the plan calls for increased education efforts for effective gun violence prevention strategies and improved coordination between state agencies and local jurisdictions to bring down gun violence.
“It’s always important for us to remember that these statistics — they’re not just numbers,” Seshamani said, “They are real people. They are real victims of a public health crisis.”
You can’t be in the minority if you’re the only one…
Months after frustration of being in the minority drove Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) to say he would not run for reelection, the freshman Republican has modified that statement a little.
He will not seek election to a seat in the House of Delegates. He will seek election to an office on the second floor of the State House — the governor’s office.
Bouchat has not yet formally filed for the office, but confirmed his intention to run for governor, first reported by last week by the Baltimore Sun. While he has not filed the paperwork, Bouchat said he intends to start running ads thiis weekend on Fox45 in Baltimore, not actually pitching his candidacy but urging people to visit  Maryland’s many historic sites. It’s a version of the short video on his delegate site, quickly rebranded to a “Bouchat for Governor” page.

Bouchat said he decided to walk away from the House after one term because of the “super minority status” of Republicans in Maryland, who hold just 28% of seats in both the House and Senate,.
“It’s pretty much hopeless to be a Republican in the Maryland General Assembly,” Bouchat said. “Maryland has been under a legislative dictatorship by the Democratic Party for 105 years.”
He blames that on gerrymandering of legislative districts. Which got him to thinking about the goveror’s race.
“On a governor level, it’s not gerrymandered — it’s statewide,” Bouchat said.
His biggest goal, if elected, is to create a solution to gerrymandering
“What I’m offering is historical,” Bouchat said. “This is going to be one of the greatest political science accomplishments in the history of the world.”
If he files, Bouchat would not be the first Republican to throw his hat in the ring for the governorship: John Myrick and Brenda Thiam are already filed for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Political observers are waiting to see if two-term GOP Gov. Larry Hogan will run for his old seat. And the Republican nominee will likely have to take on Gov. Wes Moore (D), a fundraising juggernaut in a deeply blue state.
While he has not officially filed, Bouchat has until February to sign up.
“I’m in no great hurry,” Bouchat said. “It’s a bit of a strategy to watch it all unfold.
Burd steps up at state retirement system
Robert “Bob” Burd, the deputy chief investment officer for the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, will step up next week to serve as acting CIO, the system’s board of trustees announced.
Burd will take over as interim chief on July 1, with the retrirement of current Chief Investment Officer Andrew Palmer, who has served in that role since 2015. The interim appointment of Burd was announced at the trustees June 17 meeting.
Burd has served as deputy chief investment officer since 2011, helping shape “asset allocation strategy, managing investment risk and overseeing manager selection across the $70 billion portfolio,” according to a news release from the system.
“Bob brings a deep understanding of our portfolio and a steady, principled approach to leadership,” said Executive Director Martin Noven. “He has earned the trust of the Board and I’m confident in his ability to lead the division with focus and integrity during this transitional period.”
Burd served as acting CIO once before, and system officials said his appointment now ensures uninterrupted leadership.
“Bob has worked side-by-side with our team to deliver long-term value for our members,” said State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis, Chair of the SRPS Board of Trustees. “We are fully confident in his ability to guide Maryland’s investment program during this interim period.”
The board said that under Palmer’s tenure, the system “achieved consistent outperformance, expanded internal asset management capabilities, and implemented strategic reforms across public and private markets. Burd has been instrumental in advancing these efforts and will provide continuity and stability during the leadership transition.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54613600036_900624f396_o-1024x981.jpg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

(Photo by Travis Bell/SIDELINE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)In conjunction with other southern states, Florida is developing a new university accrediting commission in response to existing agencies the governor says require schools to “bend the knee” to get accredited.
During a Thursday news conference at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced, alongside State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues and university leaders from Texas and South Carolina, that the states are developing a Commission for Public Higher Education.
DeSantis has focused heavily on “woke” ideologies by pushing legislation to ban state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and remaking state higher education institutions to be more conservative.
In the way of his higher education initiatives, he has said, are accrediting agencies that may require a commitment to those values or other expectations for a university to be recognized.
In order to “shape institutions in a positive way,” DeSantis said, “You gotta go two or three levels down sometimes. And we’ve identified this accreditation cartel as an issue for a long time.”
Florida is establishing the commission with the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, which DeSantis said will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
The layers, for example, can be shown by a 2023 law, SB 266, which outlawed state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but allowed for DEI initiatives to continue if required to maintain accreditation.
DeSantis, who used to own an LSAT prep company, said during the “woke era” “institutions really became corrupted by ideology, and they were putting ideology ahead of the pursuit of truth during COVID.”



Why is USC involved?
Thad Westbrook, board president for the University of South Carolina, joined Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as well as leaders of state schools in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, at this week’s news conference announcing the initiative to form a new accreditation agency.
Referring to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which accredits schools across the Southeast, DeSantis blasted what he called the “woke accreditation cartel,” which has been “hijacked by radical ideology.”
But Westbrook sidestepped such rhetoric in explaining what drew USC to this new partnership. 
Rather than criticize the accrediting agency for anything specific, he described accreditation and re-accreditation, which colleges must go through every five years, as “a very burdensome process.”
He told the SC Daily Gazette that USC could benefit from an accreditation agency tailored to large state college systems, “more peer-to-peer instead of a one-size-fits all” organization that covers the entire region. By joining this partnership, South Carolina’s largest university will have a seat on the governing board as it creates its standards for accreditation.
Westbrook said he wants to see standards focused on student outcomes. In particular, he wants to see increases in the number of students who graduate college within four years or less, progressing through as quickly as possible and entering the workforce.
He said he thinks some accreditation agencies stray from what’s required under the federal Higher Education Act. He said the new agency will still have rigorous standards but won’t go beyond what the law demands.
Westbrook said the costs of applying to become an accrediting agency will be borne by the state of Florida. If the accrediting agency gets federal approval, USC will only pay a membership fee if its governing board votes to leave SACS and apply for accreditation through the new organization.
For USC faculty, the impact of the arrangement is less clear. 
Faculty Senate President Wayne Outten, who teaches biochemistry, said professors and researchers are typically less concerned about which accrediting agency a college uses. When deciding whether to apply for a job, they usually weigh a college’s reputation, salaries and resources for research.
But with so few details available on the new agency, possible effects are unknown at this time.

 Timeline

DeSantis did not lay out a timeline for when the commission would be up and running, acknowledging that it has to meet federal requirements before the U.S. Department of Education can approve it.
“We’re establishing it. You kind of got to go and actually do it for, you know, some period of time,” DeSantis said, adding, “I think U.S. DOE wants to be quick on this.”
DeSantis said he nudged Rodrigues shortly after Trump won the presidency.
“We didn’t really have the prospects of launching anything like this successfully during the Biden years, but it’s a new day, and I think this is going to make a big, big difference,” DeSantis said, adding that if it gets established during the Trump presidency, “then it’s almost impossible for a future federal administration to try to upend the apple cart.”
As recently as 2020, the year after DeSantis took office, the State University System of Florida created a workgroup that, in its final report, concluded that the universities’ “Board of Governors is making a clear and steadfast commitment to prioritize and support diversity, racial and gender equity, and inclusion.”
In 2022, Florida lawmakers approved and DeSantis signed SB 7044 to provoke institutions to seek accreditation from accreditors approved by the State Board of Education or Board of Governors.
 Expecting favorability

“I think almost all the states in our region are going to be favorable to this,” DeSantis said.
“All those states have done good stuff in higher ed anyways but, you know, it’s been more difficult when you have this accreditation cartel nipping at you all the time,” he said. “You know, now I think it’s going to be really, really smooth sailing.”
Florida’s and other southern state institutions are members of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. DeSantis and Rodrigues made jabs at SACSCOC, saying Florida institutions have problems with the accrediting organization and that its member schools’ performance has not been impressive.
“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens. These reforms will benefit our faculty, our students, and the hardworking taxpayers who fund our public systems,” Rodrigues said.
In an emailed statement to the Phoenix, SACSCOC said, “We welcome any new accreditor as they go through a rigorous approval process. Accreditation is central to quality education; thus accreditors are held to high standards and must themselves be reviewed.”
“As for SACSCOC, we know we currently accredit institutions that serve the largest number of students in the country (approximately 5M),” the organization said. “As such, we will work with our partnering institutions to ensure and strengthen a high standard of accreditation that reflects the needs of students, our institutions, and the workforce.”
DeSantis complained that Florida law schools “should not be captive to having to bend the knee to get accreditation from” the American Bar Association, which he said “mandates explicit DEI compliance as a condition of accreditation” and “has now become a far left activist group.” The association has suspended its DEI standard until at least 2026.
The commission “will create a first-of-its-kind accreditation model for public higher education institutions that will offer high-quality, efficient services prioritizing academic excellence, student outcomes, and achievement,” according to the State University System.
“​​Together, we are leaving behind the legacy systems and failed institutions of the past, while charting a new course in higher education, that puts student success at the forefront of everything that we do,” said Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner, who was recently named to that position following outcry from students who feared he would politicize the position.
 Union backlash

The Florida Education Association and United Faculty of Florida released a joint statement following DeSantis’ announcement, saying they “strongly oppose” the move as “directly threatens the independence, integrity, and academic credibility of the state’s higher education system.”
“Accreditation matters because it’s the backbone of academic freedom, shared governance, and public trust in the quality of our institutions,” UFF President Teresa M. Hodge said in a news release.
“This proposed state accreditor appears designed to align more with political priorities rather than academic independence. It seems to be the state’s latest attempt to exert top-down control over what faculty can teach and what students are allowed to learn.”
Andrew Spar, president of the FEA, said he is concerned about how a new accreditor might affect teacher preparation programs.
“Students learn best when they’re free to learn and educators are free to teach — not when curriculum decisions are dictated by politics,” Spar said.



The commission’s announced core principles:

It is appropriate and necessary to introduce competition, aligned with state and institutional needs, into the existing marketplace of university accreditation.
It is in the best interests of all interested parties, including students, to launch an accrediting body comprised of true peer institutions focused on public colleges and universities and their governing university systems.
It is imperative to reduce bureaucracy through a more efficient and focused accreditation process, which will result in lower costs and significant time savings for member institutions, and which will translate into lower tuition prices for students and families.
It is critical to ensure that this new accrediting body is accountable to the states of the member institutions.
It is necessary for the new accrediting body to become and remain recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for the purposes of Title IV participation by its accredited institutions.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Last spring Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo posted a photo of his daughter Vera wearing a baby blue mermaid-style dress with puffy sleeves and a train. She had designed it on her own so, certainly, as a fashion designer who didn’t hesitate to make a gown for a loved one, he made her vision come true. 
On Friday, Vera wore that gown again while singing for hundreds during the celebration of life Ah Loo’s friends and family organized after he was tragically wounded during the “No Kings” rally June 14. Many joined Vera in donning the tributes to the renowned designer’s style, wearing geometrical prints, flowers, formal wraparound skirts known as ie faitaga, sleek hairstyles, and so, so many of Ah Loo’s gowns.  
Laura Ah Loo, his wife, wore a flowy, green dress adorned with a yellow lei. It was one of the best dresses of the night, Telesia Afeaki Tonga, the event’s emcee said, because she was one of his main sources of inspiration. Laura’s voice cracked as she thanked family, friends and fellow protesters for all the love they had received in the last weeks.

“Losing Afa feels like losing the sun, our light, our warmth and our comfort,” Laura Ah Loo said. “It is more devastating than I can ever put into words, because no amount of words can encompass who he was as a person and who he was to me and our babies.”
Ah Loo’s big community gathered at the Salt Palace Convention Center’s grand ballroom, a room as big as the presence he had in the Pacific Islander communities in Utah and beyond.
“Of course it had to be in a grand ballroom, like only he would have. Absolutely extra,” Tonga said.

Ah Loo’s participation on “Project Runway” in 2019 expanded his presence in the fashion industry. However, being the first Samoan to participate in the show, among many other feats, made him a point of reference in Polynesian communities. After moving to Utah, he continued weaving his legacy, mentoring anyone with a creative pursuit and supporting the state’s Pacific Islander community though a nonprofit he co-founded, Creative Pacific.
While his job took him to other cities and countries, his greatest joy wasn’t on a runway, but at home with his family, his wife said. And sometimes, at McDonald’s with a large Coke. 
“I will miss taking sips of his drinks because I never wanted to order my own, his constant eye rolls at my antics and hearing him speak Samoan, his beautiful singing voice,” Laura Ah Loo said. “And, as he called it, his hyena laugh. But to me, it was the best sound in the world.” 
Beloved Utah fashion designer’s friends remember his life and his last moments

After her loss, Laura Ah Loo has been planning to continue her husband’s work and legacy, a task that now seems impossible to equally replicate. But, she still sees parts of him every day, in their kids’ brown eyes, creativity, “healing hugs,” and “larger than life” personalities, all attributes they share with Ah Loo. Also in the remaining fingerprints he left behind and his voice in all the videos saved in their phones. 
Just like Ah Loo did after his fashion shows, Laura Ah Loo walked along a runway, holding Vera’s and her son Isaac’s hands while friends and family gave a standing ovation. 
June 14 remains a painful day for his family. But Laura Ah Loo still finds inspiration in the sign he held that day, which read “The world is watching.”
“They were watching then, and they’re watching, certainly watching now. The world is watching how we carry his light, how we treat each other, how each keep choosing love in the face of unthinkable loss, how we raise our children, how we fight for joy in spite of hard times,” she said. “He will not be forgotten.”
Others also took the stage to perform a musical number or a dance, often included in Polynesian funerals, or to tell stories of Ah Loo’s life as a beloved mentor, friend and brother, distinguished by his sense of humor, sarcasm and kindness.

“I see all your posts about him. I see all your tributes about him, and how I’ve sat down several times to write something about him, but I can’t,” his sister Ofeira Asuao said. “There’s just no words for me to explain the impact that he’s had.”
While Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson never met Ah Loo, she said in her remarks that she has come to know his spirit through the love and admiration shown by the community he helped shape. 
“I personally am inspired to continue the work he cared about, advocating for equality, embracing creativity and fostering a stronger and more compassionate community for his Pacific Islander friends and beyond,” Wilson said. “Afa, may your light continue to shine and may others be inspired by your fearless advocacy, your life’s mission, love of friends and family and your creative spirit.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Afa-Celebration_SH_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.

Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through COVID, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

Michigan’s top election official is locked in a clamorous legal battle with Republican lawmakers over access to election training materials, a conflict that likely has less to do with policy than politics — and the coming race for governor.
And if the battle continues at its current volume, voter trust in Michigan’s elections could take a beating.
On one side is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who won her 2022 re-election race by nearly 14 percentage points and is now a leading Democratic candidate for governor. Since 2019, she has been a key part of the Democratic power structure in the executive branch and the face of election oversight in a swing state that became a target of heavy scrutiny and conspiracy theories after Donald Trump’s 2020 loss.
On the other side is the Michigan state House, back under Republican control since January, which has subpoenaed her, sued her, and even made moves to impeach her.
Leading the charge there is Rep. Rachelle Smit, a Republican and former township clerk from Martin who took over in January as chair of the House Committee on Election Integrity. For several months, she has been seeking access to the Department of State’s election training portal to check for “flawed guidance.” Benson and her office have been pushing back.
With each day, the confrontation over election manuals looks more and more like a mobilization for next year’s political campaigns, where Republicans hope to retake the governor’s mansion after eight years of being shut out of statewide office. Benson is one of the people who stand in the way.
Smit hasn’t identified specific concerns about the content of the training manuals, but has instead cited what she calls a “concerning track record” of illegal guidance from Benson, based on the fact that Benson’s office has faced many election-related lawsuits, and has lost some of them.
“The Michigan House Committee on Election Integrity has a duty to provide oversight,” Smit told Votebeat. “We seek to review the training materials to ensure MDOS is properly training clerks on the law.”
Benson’s office has not provided access to all the documents upon request, citing concerns over information security. That has prompted an escalating series of steps by the Republicans to challenge Benson for the access, and countermoves by Benson to defend her office’s response.
Their dispute is now before the Michigan Court of Claims, which has set deadlines for filing legal briefs, though an actual resolution could be weeks away. Meanwhile, both sides are using the fight as fodder for fund-raising appeals.
 Conflict heats up after power shift in the House

The conflict has simmered for months, but escalated after Republicans reclaimed the House in November’s election. That’s when Smit requested access to the state’s election training portal, which provides manuals and tools for local officials.
Smit said the Department of State initially couldn’t fulfill her request. She then filed a public-records request and was told it would require 140 hours and nearly $9,000 to fulfill — a cost she called “ridiculous.”
Shortly after, Smit was named the chair of the House election committee, newly renamed the Committee on Election Integrity. She then sent another request for the information, which the Department of State said it would fulfill in part. But the requested documents never came. At Smit’s request, the House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena for the documents.
Republicans say the subpoena was necessary to ensure the balance of power in Michigan government. Smit’s office did not respond to Votebeat questions on what specific concerns prompted the inquiry.
Benson, whose office also handles motor vehicle services, has faced numerous challenges to her guidance and conduct of elections — more election lawsuits than her last four predecessors combined. But her record is better than that of past secretaries from both parties. A review by the Michigan Information & Research Service found that while Benson has lost some election-related lawsuits, she has won significantly more cases than her predecessors.
Several cases have had mixed rulings, like a lawsuit from the Republican National Committee over voter signatures on absentee ballots, where part of Benson’s guidance was struck down while other pieces were allowed to remain in place. Out of 69 total cases since 2019, Benson’s office had five “losses,” according to the MIRS analysis.
Department of State spokesperson Angela Benander said the cost estimate the department gave Smit after the November request followed state Freedom of Information Act requirements, including producing the records and redacting sensitive sections. “We are now well above that,” she said, noting that more than 20 staff members have worked on it over recent weeks.
The Department of State said it made multiple offers to provide the requested materials securely with redactions, but the Oversight Committee rejected them. The subpoena sought information that could jeopardize election security, Benander told Votebeat in April, by risking the chain of custody of ballots and revealing specific locations for trainings for election officials, among other concerns. Election workers across the state have faced threats of violence in recent years.
The department then went public, posting information about the documents it had already shared with lawmakers. Benson reiterated the department’s position that releasing sensitive information could jeopardize election security.
“This is true even if those seeking the information are well-intentioned,” she said in May. “Each time sensitive information is released, its risk of misuse increases.”
Since then, she has issued regular updates, sharing more documents, doubling down on security concerns, and preparing for a legal showdown.
Republicans have also escalated: On May 22, the House voted along party lines to hold Benson and the entire Department of State in contempt. On June 3, Rep. Jim DeSana, a Republican from Carleton, introduced articles of impeachment against her in a House resolution, alleging that she abused her authority, mishandled records, and intimidated local officials in the way she oversaw the state’s elections.
Then, earlier this month, the House Oversight Committee sued Benson and her department, alleging they were refusing to provide the training documents “in their irrational and even conspiratorial objections to the House Subpoenas.”
Benson said in a statement that she welcomed the suit as a chance to resolve the matter in court.
 What will voters make of the Benson vs. GOP fight?

While the battle has been useful for driving fund-raising campaigns — for both Benson and the Republicans — it’s unlikely to swing any votes so far out from an actual election, David Dulio, a political science professor at Oakland University, told Votebeat.
The House GOP effort might be intended to damage Benson’s campaign, he said, “but the people who they would want to persuade aren’t paying attention. They have other stuff to worry about.”
Jeffrey Bernstein, a political science professor at Eastern Michigan University, agreed. Those who are most tuned in to politics probably have already formed their opinions on how Michigan’s elections are run, he said.
“People are going to start paying attention soon enough,” he said, “but there will be other things happening then to occupy their attention.”
Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson, a political science professor at Wayne State University, worries, though, that such a pitched conflict in Lansing could have a lasting effect for people who aren’t so tuned into politics by casting a “vague and hazy” cloud over elections.
Even this far out from an election, she told Votebeat, “when you start casting doubt on integrity, public trust suffers.”
The best case scenario, Sarbaugh-Thompson said, is a quick ruling from the courts to quiet the entire issue. But she doesn’t expect quiet anytime soon.

Dorie Ladner was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. She and her sister, Joyce, became involved early with the civil rights movement, working with Medgar Evers, Vernon Dahmer, Clyde Kennard and others. 
She and her sister were kicked out of Jackson State University for their support of the Tougaloo Nine, who integrated the all-white library in downtown Jackson. They became even more active at Tougaloo College. They worked with the Freedom Riders, joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped with the 1963 March on Washington. 
Dorie escorted Fannie Lou Hamer to register to vote. Joyce pursued graduate school, earning a doctorate in sociology, becoming the first female president of Howard University. Dorie continued her civil rights work, participating in every major civil rights march through 1968. In Washington, D.C., she earned her master’s in social work, counseling emergency room patients, visiting schools and working with the Rape Crisis Center. 
The sisters were honored at the Kennedy Center, and Dorie received the Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute on Citizenship and Democracy Humanitarian Award. A decade before her death in 2024, she received an honorary doctorate from Tougaloo.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland households will have to wait just a little bit longer for a promised rebate on their energy bills amid the summer heat.
While legislative leaders had said they expected the first payments in July, the Maryland Public Service Commission said Friday that the first round of rebates to all residential energy customers is expected in August or September. A second round is anticipated in either January or February.
Total payments are expected to average about $80 per household for the year.
PSC Chair Fred Hoover said the commission spoke with utilities — which will actually dole out the rebates to customers — as well as ratepayer advocates and its own staff, to come up with the best plan for handing out the money.
The commission “has selected a plan that will allow for the most equitable, efficient and timely distribution of refunds to provide relief to customers, particularly those most affected by bill increases this past winter,” Hoover wrote.
The refund payments will show up as credits on ratepayers’ bills and will be based on a customer’s usage over a year, with those who use more energy getting a larger rebate. But the PSC also directed utilities to disburse 25% of the money evenly across all ratepayers, to ensure all customers get a baseline amount.
The PSC also advised utilities to advertise ways for customers to donate their rebate to others if they choose, including to the Fuel Fund of Maryland or SMECO’s Members Helping Members program. For the winter rebate, utilities were told to explore ways that customers could refuse the rebate and send it instead to other customers who receive bill assistance from the state.

The rebates were authorized by legislators as part of the Next Generation Energy Act, a wide-ranging bill that also included a regulatory fast-track for new power plants and other energy infrastructure in the state.
Lawmakers tapped $200 million to pay the rebates from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which utilities if they do not purchase a specified amount of renewable energy for their portfolios. The fund has ballooned in recent years.
During a news conference Wednesday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) referenced this week’s high temperatures, which flirted with 100, and their impact on already soaring bills.
“I have an HVAC repair person coming tomorrow,” Ferguson said. “So we are personally dealing with the challenges of what I know a number of Maryland families are, which is unbelievably hot weather, and then the resultant impact on people’s bills, which feels like a double hit. I am as frustrated as anyone.”
High utility bills were a major topic of conversation for the 2025 legislature, following high costs during a cold winter, thanks in large part to higher natural gas distribution rates. But now, electricity rates are poised to increase as well for the delivery year that began in June.
The increases will hit different customers at different times: June 1 for SMECO customers, August for Pepco and Delmarva Power customers, and October for Potomac Edison. BGE, which will have the highest increases, was ordered by the PSC to spread them over three months this fall and again next spring, in order to dull the impact in the high-use summer and winter periods.
Moore signed the Next Generation bill and one other energy bill, but vetoed the Energy Resource Planning Act, which would have set up an in-house energy planning office for state government. He recently critiqued the Next Generation law, saying it did not go far enough to attract power generators to build in Maryland.
“We introduced legislation this year that would have allowed more nuclear into the state, that would have allowed nuclear to be seen as a clean energy source, which it is,” Moore said. “I’m proud of the work we did in partnership with the legislature, but I want to be crystal clear: It did not go far enough.”
Ferguson pushed back this week.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I don’t know what the governor was talking about when he said that. I genuinely have no idea what he was referencing,” Ferguson said during his news conference. “I think that we did incredibly important work to make it easier for all sorts of cleaner energy, from natural gas to wind to solar to geothermal to batteries.”
He said Moore’s nuclear bill would have increased costs for ratepayers, which “was not something that we were going to tolerate. So, what we did was incorporate components of the governor’s bill into the Next Generation Act.”
The bill directs state agencies to pursue nuclear cost-sharing agreements with neighboring states and agreements with federal agencies about nuclear siting, including for small modular reactors.
The fiscal note for Moore’s bill said that “in the short term, the bill appears likely to increase electricity rates,” because it increased the amount utilities would have to pay the state to comply with a solar energy goal. It also established a nuclear energy procurement mechanism that would be funded by ratepayers.
But legislative analysts said the governor’s bill had “the potential to provide other benefits to the broader energy market and eventually reduce associated electricity rates paid by customers in the State.”
Ferguson was also quick to note that increasing power generation in the state isn’t a cure-all. Maryland is part of a 13-state region whose electrical grid is controlled by PJM Interconnection, which has been criticized for policies that make it difficult for new power sources — particularly renewable — to come online at a time of surging demand.
“Generation is a problem within the PJM territory, for all 13 states, and even in states that are net exporters, that generally are sending their energy to other states,” Ferguson said. “This, sadly, is not a problem that we can fix in a day, a week or a month.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/transmission-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 08:04:05.007854

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Internal communications reveal Vermont prisons’ frustrations working with ICE.","Greg Hale didn’t understand why border patrol officers from Maine were showing up at the prison he oversees in St. Albans town. He was used to federal immigration authorities bringing detainees in from Vermont’s northern border. But this signaled a shift. 
The superintendent of Northwest State Correctional Facility, Hale had previously informed his contacts at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that Vermont didn’t want to become the feds’ hub in the Northeast.
“Apparently they are disregarding that,” he noted in a memo to his higher-ups at the Vermont Department of Corrections in early March.  
The emails reveal mounting frustration within Vermont’s corrections system as ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have increasingly relied on the state’s prisons to warehouse detained immigrants. New demands, arrivals at all hours and a rare disease are just some of the challenges Vermont’s prisons have faced while working with federal immigration authorities.

Internal communications since the start of President Donald Trump’s second administration, obtained through a public records request, offer a window into how the Vermont Department of Corrections has cooperated with — and pushed back against — federal immigration police as the number of detententions increased. Leaders have navigated the growing strain on the state’s prison system while also encountering the unique health and language difficulties posed by housing immigrant detainees.
Nationwide, ICE is detaining about 59,000 people, a possible record. Deportations have also ramped up, according to the New York Times, while border apprehensions have fallen. 
Regionally, in addition to Vermont’s prisons, the federal government uses facilities in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts to hold immigrants, many of whom have not been charged with crimes. 
Vermont’s memorandum of understanding with U.S. immigration authorities gives them access to the state’s six prisons in exchange for $180 per-detained person, per-day. That deal expires in August.
This year, the Legislature passed a law removing a provision in state statute that allowed collaboration between local and state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities during declared states of emergency. 
In Vermont, the St. Albans prison serves as ICE’s primary jail for male detainees, and Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington holds female immigration detainees. The average number of immigrants detained for federal officials in Vermont’s prisons fluctuates, hovering in the teens to the 20s on any given day.

Federal officials have also shuffled detainees from other states into and out of Vermont, and used commercial flights out of the Burlington airport to facilitate deportations. 
Those jailed in Vermont’s prisons include people with established lives in the state, like farmworkers. Vermont’s prisons have also held people from other New England states, like a Russian scientist working at Harvard University.
VTDigger’s reporting previously revealed the challenges facing jailed immigrants. Several people in prison reported that ICE detainees were struggling to access phone calls, lawyers and medical attention, often due to a lack of translation services. The department of corrections has invested increased resources to address language access concerns, documents show. 
Following the high-profile arrests of Columbia University student and Palestinian rights activist Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University grad student Rümeysa Öztürk, Vermont’s work with ICE drew increased scrutiny. 
The Vermont Department of Corrections declined interview requests for this story, instead answering questions over email. Asked about workers’ complaints with the feds, Haley Sommer, a department spokesperson, wrote “DOC is committed to maintaining a collaborative working relationship with our federal partners.”
‘Not a fan of ICE’
As federal authorities increased their use of Vermont’s prisons, leadership at the St. Albans prison grew frustrated, records indicate. 
ICE agents’ demands stacked up. They requested detainees’ medical information, which they said was “required for the flights,” in addition to bagged meals and clothing. Sometimes, they arrived in the middle of the night. 
In late February, St. Albans’ assistant superintendent informed his higher-up that during a recent interaction with ICE, agents were “very very lax in their security procedures around their keys and they were rude when confronted about it.”
“Let’s get a report and then we can yell at them,” Hale, the superintendent, responded.  
The next month, ICE transferred 19 people out of the prison at 4 a.m, requesting medical summaries, two meals, and closed-toed shoes for each. The day after, federal agents brought in 16 new detainees, according to communications records. 
“Mostly I am concerned about the traffic, my booking is not built for 31 ICE movements in 24 hours, this is on top of normal movements,” Hale wrote to his corrections colleagues. “Booking is swamped and we are going to miss something critical.”
He made his exasperation clear to department leadership.
“I continue to push back on them, but they are technically operating within the agreement I think, it is just overwhelming us,” he wrote of ICE. “This break-neck pace with them is going to be the cause of bigger issues.”
Hale attached security camera photos of the crowded areas, though the department declined to provide them in the records request, citing security concerns. 
“What a mess and by all accounts not a safe situation for our staff to be in,” Al Cormier, DOC’s chief of operations, responded to Hale.  
The superintendent was taken by surprise when the news arrived in March that border patrol agents from Maine were bringing detainees to St. Albans. One of his colleagues questioned ICE on the decision, writing, “It was my understanding that we don’t accept individuals that cross the border from other states … Is this a new practice that we have started?”
Elsewhere, Hale noted ICE provides little information to state staff — and he was skeptical of the information the feds do provide. 
“It’s unusual for them to share much of anything honestly and what is shared I don’t trust,” he wrote.

Around the same time Hale was raising concern about the feds’ increased presence, his counterpart at the South Burlington prison, Superintendent Theresa Messier, also noted an uptick. In an email to the department’s health equity program director, she asked for additional support for the women’s prison’s work with detained immigrants.
“I think it would be a good idea for you to come to talk with staff regarding ICE detainees. There has been an increase with them recently and there have been issues,” Messier wrote.
But though corrections staff expressed annoyance at ICE’s strain on the system, the working relationship appeared solid from the feds’ perspective.
After an inspection of the women’s prison this spring, ICE’s detention oversight branch reported they were “highly impressed with all of the operations” and identified no deficiencies.  
In April, Nick Deml, the corrections department’s commissioner, convened a meeting with the South Burlington and St. Albans superintendents to discuss their experience working with the feds. 
In an email to many of the department’s central office staff on the day of the scheduled meeting, Hale offered his thoughts on the state’s continued cooperation with immigration authorities. While he described himself as “not a fan of ICE,” he didn’t think ending the state’s contract would impact the feds’ operations, and he feared financial retaliation from the Trump administration.
“That said, I do think working toward restructuring the contract to better reflect the amount of work, time, and other resources it takes to house their detainees not to mention meeting our own operational (requirements), would be worthwhile if that is a supported direction at some point,” he wrote to department leadership. 
Inroads for a deadly disease
With detainees arriving at Vermont’s prisons after leaving countries around the world, staff communication shows the emergence of a unique health challenge: tuberculosis. 
In late April, an infection control coordinator with the department’s health services contractor, Wellpath, outlined concern about detained immigrants carrying and spreading the dangerous disease — a bacterial illness most often impacting the lungs that is rare in the United States. While treatable, tuberculosis kills more than a million people per year worldwide. 
Later, Travis Denton, DOC’s facilities division director, summarized the issue as described by Wellpath. Procedures at the time allowed ICE detainees to enter the general population before the results of their tuberculosis tests came back, he wrote. 
“Recent incidents have involved patients who were later confirmed TB-positive after already entering GP, posing serious exposure risks,” Denton told colleagues in a memo. 
Last year, there were more than 10,000 tuberculosis cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because immigration detainees may have arrived in the U.S. from countries where tuberculosis is more prevalent, some of those cases are found in prisons. 
Last fall in Louisiana, an ICE detainee tested positive for a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis, but it’s unclear how prevalent the disease is across all facilities. According to a 2004 memo written by an ICE official, there were between 100-150 tuberculosis cases a year in detainees at that time. Academic studies have shown immigrants detained in the U.S. are far more likely to have the disease than the country’s population as a whole.
Language barriers and unreliable self reporting made it challenging to identify people’s tuberculosis history, Denton wrote, and the disease’s symptoms overlap with drug detox and Covid-19 — health concerns staff are more accustomed to.

The medical contractor proposed a system to account for the concerns. Detainees would receive a tuberculosis test during intake and spend the first two to three days in restrictive housing or another separated space until the test results arrived. Anyone who tested positive would receive a chest X-ray and potentially be moved to the hospital. 
“I want to just flag that the distance between this proposal, and successful implementation, is not quick or short,” Denton wrote in the memo.
He described the proposal as a big undertaking reminiscent of procedural changes during the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is further complicated by the focus on ICE detainees, which is a chaotic process that we have very little control over, and must be handled strategically due to the high-profile nature of topic,” he wrote. 
Later, as Denton informed the department’s leadership of the proposal, his skepticism grew. “While the intent behind Wellpath’s proposed protocol is understandable, it doesn’t appear to fully account for the significant operational impact it would create,” he wrote, questioning whether there was any input from the prison’s security staff.
Hale, the St. Albans prison leader, echoed Denton’s concerns, saying Northwest lacked the cell space for such a procedure: “I get the concern but I don’t see how this will work.”
Asked this week whether the department had ultimately decided to change procedures, Sommer, the spokesperson, wrote that Wellpath had “enhanced patient monitoring practices.”
“Since the implementation of the new policy, there have not been any active confirmed TB cases,” she told VTDigger.
While ICE will likely continue to work with Vermont’s prisons, what that work looks like could change. 
Gov. Phil Scott holds sole authority in the state to partner with federal immigration authorities. Asked in June about whether the state would renew or alter the existing agreement, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, signaled the deal would continue in some form. 
“The Governor has been clear that he believes there should be a state contract with ICE because canceling or allowing the contract to expire won’t stop detainments, it will simply mean detainees will be sent someplace else,” she wrote. “We’re not going to get out ahead of contract negotiations, but we are reviewing the (contract) and considering changes.”

Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
5 million adults
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through Covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Arkansas, Georgia
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
More than 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it. 


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that. 


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Two wins and two sellouts marked this year’s women’s exhibition matches as a permanent team is in the works.

Busy Anderson is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — A year’s worth of anticipation hailed down on Vermont Green’s Sophie Reale as she blew past two defenders and harvested the first goal of the women’s exhibition matches last week. 
Five thousand fans brought Virtue Field to capacity and spilled onto the nearby hillside for the games against semipro teams Flower City Union and A.S. Blainville. World Cup winner Sam Mewis returned as head coach this year, but young fans were no farther from the field’s railings as she took the pitch. 
“Playing for the national team, playing in the NWSL, the fans have this hungriness for more: for more access, for more autographs, for pictures,” said Mewis, who moved to Colchester after retiring from the U.S. team. “It is honestly really familiar from playing at the level that I played at before.”
A hum about Vermont Green’s expansion into the women’s game underscored the two sellouts and two wins: 4–0 over Flower City, 2–1 over Blainville. This year, nurturing a lush landscape for soccer in Vermont is top of mind.

Players convened June 9 for the first of three practices before their Flower City matchup, many learning each other’s names for the first time. In their two games, Green would entertain and improve, Mewis said that day.   
“Every time you get the ball is an opportunity to express yourself,” coach Brad Cole added during drills. 
Last season, Vermont Green announced a permanent women’s squad is a matter of when, not if. Exhibition games will continue until a full season is secured, with Mewis and University of Vermont women’s soccer head coach Kristi Huizenga guiding the launch.

Olivia Borgen, Sophia Lowenberg and Violet Rademacher claimed a goal each for the Green in Wednesday’s second half, conceding none. The 4–0 outcome was much more comfortable than the Green’s 5–4, penalty kick win over FC Laval in 2024. The difference was in the roster, and particularly the personnel on the sidelines, said goalkeeping coach Erin Murphy. 
“It’s not just, we took the male coaches and had them go female,” she said. “I think Sam has really embraced her role a lot this year.” 
Joining Mewis was former Portland Thorns player Mo Fitzgerald, with Murphy stepping up as a coach after her own career with UVM and the Green. 
“You also have to develop coaches, more women coaches, more referees.  You need more administrators. You have to have talent in the front office,” sports journalist Meg Linehan said on “The Women’s Game,” a podcast run by Mewis.
At the top of both matches, the Green and their opponents walked out with girls from Nordic SC, Monarchs SC and the Mad River Valley Soccer Association. All-female referees supervised the field and ball girls fueled the fast pace. During Saturday’s contest, Democratic U.S. Rep. Becca Balint announced that the Vermont Community Foundation would send $10,000 to the Burlington School District to buy cleats and other gear.
The National Women’s Soccer League has seen a 163% increase in attendance since its 2013 start and will add the nearby Boston Legacy to its ranks in 2026. The Massachusetts club’s swan logo was scattered in the Virtue Field stands at the Green’s exhibition matches less than a week after the crest was unveiled.

Joining the surge is the professional women’s United Soccer League Super League, home to eight clubs founded in August 2024. Tampa Bay won the inaugural championship in front of a sold out crowd Saturday night, and seven new teams are set to debut next season. 
“I’ve played soccer in the mid-’70s in Venezuela where it was a very hot sport, and just to see the degree of athleticism that these women have, how far the sport has come in terms of how soccer is played with women, is amazing,” said fan Alicia Daniel from Burlington.
The Green has a solid foundation on which to rest ambitions for a second team. Vermont led the nation in youth sports participation in the most recent measure by the federally funded and directed National Survey of Children’s Health: 69% of kids ages 6-17 played on a sports team or took lessons in 2022, well above the national average of 54%. 
Vermont families have 46 competitive clubs and 51 recreational programs to choose from under the Vermont Soccer Association, the state’s arm of U.S. Youth Soccer. When Andrew Minnis joined the state org as executive director last December, he looked to collaborate with the Green’s founders right away. 
“A big push of mine since I came in has been really trying to bridge the gap of southern Vermont,” Minnis said. 
Clubs under the association are more abundant in and around Chittenden County, with less access to youth soccer south of Montpelier, he said. 
The association’s partnership with U.S. Youth Soccer’s Europe branch, announced last month, holds promise for an exchange of knowledge overseas that could help coaches add teams to Vermont’s inventory, Minnis said.  
At the moment, when teens surpass the challenge of local clubs, their paths upward become more sparse. Players can be selected for Vermont’s Olympic Development Program with the chance to represent their state, region or country but have few options outside those rosters.

In high school, the Green’s Liv White commuted three hours from her hometown of Pittsford to play with New England Mutiny, a Massachusetts club, she said on “The Women’s Game.” When coaching local clubs, White’s teammate Lauren DeGroot sees that routes to elite teams lead kids out of Vermont. 
“These girls are super talented, and we’re able to see that from such a young age, and it’s unfortunate that you see those girls and you feel like you’re doing them a disservice cause there aren’t those opportunities,” she said. “You think, ‘Can we send them down to Massachusetts, Jersey, so they can get that? Cause they aren’t getting it here.’” 
Female footballers of the Green’s caliber are still looking elsewhere for off-season training.
“I have to drive an hour and 15 minutes to Quebec to play soccer over the summer,” said Sydney Remington, a UVM player, of her training without the Green. 
Green forward Erin Flurey closed shop that night, poking in a loose ball to slash Blainville’s 1–0 lead and chipping the keeper in a bold signoff for a 2–1 win. The women’s exhibition team concluded year two undefeated. 
Best friends Marie Coyne and Veda Pfeifer walked out to centerfield hand in hand with Green and Blainville players before kick off. The girls are 10 years old and don’t doubt they can compete on Virtue someday. They just need some support. 
“Like cheering for you and saying, ‘You got this,’” said Pfeifer. 
Convinced the Green is here to stay, fans imagine the club playing at home fields all around Vermont, not just at Virtue, and even a new stadium open to local teams when Green isn’t in town. But a simpler goal played on repeat all week: 
“I would like to see a women’s team. Period,” said fan Annette Seidenglanz.

A Utah State University study finds Airbnb-style rentals are reshaping life for Bear Lake residents.
The post Beloved summer vacation spot bordering western Wyoming is losing its charm, residents say appeared first on WyoFile .","This story is being reprinted with permission from the Salt Lake Tribune, a Utah nonprofit newsroom.
Bear Lake—Residents of a tourist destination straddling the Utah-Idaho state line say the communities here have long been close-knit, but new research shows that sense of neighborly connection may be disappearing.
Utah State University’s Community and Natural Resources Institute recently released results from a survey that show growing concerns among Bear Lake residents over the rising number of short-term rentals, such as Airbnb properties, in the area.
Alex Theophilus, a sociology PhD student and lead author of the report, said these properties may be contributing to the weakening of community ties. He spent months in 2024 interviewing residents of Garden City and Laketown in Utah, and Montpelier, Bennington, Paris, Fish Haven and Saint Charles in Idaho, about their experiences. The lake is about a 45-minute drive away for Wyomingites who live in Cokeville and Kemmerer.
“There’s not that same connection built season over season that people felt existed in the Bear Lake area,” Theophilus said. “They think short-term rentals are posing a threat to that.”
The rise of platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo throughout the 2010s, combined with a surge in tourism during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, spurred rapid growth in short-term rentals around Bear Lake, Theophilus said. This was made worse by the limited availability of hotels.

Research shifted focus
In the spring and summer of 2024, Theophilus and his research team conducted interviews with both full-time and seasonal residents of Bear Lake to understand how changes in the environment and community were affecting quality of life. While short-term rentals were not the original focus, the properties came up in nearly every conversation, Theophilus said.
One issue brought up by residents, he said, is housing affordability and availability. Many vacation rental owners don’t live nearby and treat these homes as investments to rent out during peak tourist season and earn some extra cash. This often means homes that could be used by year-round or seasonal residents are instead being taken off the market or built specifically for visitors.
Some residents surveyed worry that neighborhoods with many of these properties lose the stability and relationships that come from long-term neighbors, Theophilus said.
“People talked about how if too many of the houses in their neighborhoods are short-term rentals, then their kids don’t have neighborhood kids to play with,” he said, “because there’s this revolving door of people coming in and out of the community for that short-term rental, rather than building relationships with their neighbors in the longer term.”
There are also concerns about trash, parking disputes and noise complaints tied to disrespectful renters, he added.
More than 1,000 Airbnb listings are spread across Rich County, Utah, and Bear Lake County, Idaho — areas with fewer than 10,000 permanent residents combined, Theophilus said. And Airbnb is just one of several short-term rental services in the area.
“There were lots of folks we talked to who were concerned that the community is developing in a way that caters to wealthier tourists or wealthier newcomers,” Theophilus said, “and that the values and considerations of longtime community members aren’t necessarily being taken into account as frequently as some folks wish they would.”

Existing regulations
Mitch Poulsen, executive director of the Bear Lake Regional Commission, said regulations for short-term rentals also vary sharply between the Utah and Idaho sides of the lake. While its residents still report concerns, Rich County, Utah, has had a permitting process for these properties for about seven years, with some basic rules, he said.
But Bear Lake County, Idaho, has almost no regulations, leading to overcrowded properties, camping in yards and overloaded septic systems, Poulsen said. In some cases, he added, old farmhouses with just one or two bedrooms are packed well beyond their capacity with large groups.
“I would like to see them regulated,” Poulsen said. “The attitude right now is let the market dictate, and I just don’t know that’s a good idea. When you’ve got houses that have 60 and 80 people in them, it’s not really a residence anymore.”
He feels Utah’s requirements, which call for a license and limits on guests and parking, are not particularly burdensome.
“It’s just unfortunate,” he said, “that Idaho can’t see that.”
Regulation on the Idaho side would have to come from the state Legislature. Some homeowner associations here have taken matters into their own hands. Kevin McLeod, president of the Bear Lake West HOA, said his community bans short-term rentals to protect amenities like pools and water usage.
“When these large groups rent these homes, it impacts your amenities,” McLeod said. “It impacts everything.”
Bear Lake West’s ban on short-term rentals was written into its governing documents before the Idaho Legislature passed a law limiting new HOA restrictions on them. That change prevents newly formed HOAs from outright banning short-term rentals — but communities like Bear Lake West that had preexisting restrictions are allowed to maintain them.
Since then, McLeod said the HOA has continued to survey its members on whether short-term rentals should be allowed.
“Far and away the majority has been ‘no,’” he said, “so we’ve not moved that direction.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

She slept by his hospital bedside for weeks when he was extremely sick from untreated HIV.(Amy Maxmen/KFF Health News)GREENVILLE, Miss. — Cedric Sturdevant woke up with “a bit of depression” but made it to church, as he does every Sunday. In a few days, he would drive from Mississippi to Washington, D.C., to join HIV advocates at an April rally against the Trump administration’s actions.
It had clawed back more than $11 billion in federal public health grants to states and abruptly terminated millions of dollars in funds for HIV work in the United States. Testing and outreach for HIV faltered in the South, a region that accounts for more than half of all HIV diagnoses.
Dangerous changes loomed: To compensate for tax cuts for the wealthy, Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill and budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 threaten to curtail Medicaid, which provides health coverage for people with low incomes and disabilities. About 40% of adults with HIV rely on it for their lifesaving treatments.
Further, the budget proposes to eliminate all HIV prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This alone could lead to an additional 14,600 HIV-related deaths within the next five years, according to one analysis.
Trump’s budget proposal also would cancel a major grant that provides housing assistance for people with HIV. And it would end a strategic initiative to expand HIV services in minority communities, and another to support the mental health of people of color with HIV or at risk of infection.
“President Trump is committed to eliminating radical gender and racial ideologies that poison the minds of Americans,” a White House addendum to the budget says. Letters terminating HIV grants used similar language, targeting “diversity,” “equity,” and “gender minorities,” words that focus resources where they are needed most. Black and Latino people account for about 70% of new HIV infections in the U.S.
The cuts affect Sturdevant personally. He is a gay, Black man living with HIV and the co-founder of a grassroots group that combats health disparities in the Mississippi Delta, one of the poorest regions of the country.
 
That morning at church, a close friend, pastor Jerry Shelton of Anointed Oasis of Love Ministry, asked Sturdevant to help him deliver a sermon about resisting the urge to give up when life is hard. “The storm may come, but I shall not be moved!” Shelton preached, directing the congregation to approach adversity with confidence in themselves and in God. “Walk boldly!” he shouted.
After the service, Sturdevant resolved to bring the same energy to Washington. He’d tell his colleagues that they are survivors, he said. He’d tell them, “Let’s get together and make a plan.”
In the past few months, HIV advocates have begun to organize and strategize ways to limit the damage as federal funds are slashed and inflammatory rhetoric rises.
“It is a very scary time to be Black, queer, and living with HIV,” said Marnina Miller, co-executive director of the Positive Women’s Network, a nationwide group for women living with HIV. “But I am grateful that I am part of a community that will not bow down.”
“People are not giving up,” said June Gipson, the CEO of a health care nonprofit, My Brother’s Keeper, in Mississippi. Then she referenced the 1980s cartoon where heroes combine forces to create a super robot to defend the universe:
“We’ve got to form Voltron.”

The weight of stigma
Sturdevant often reminds his colleagues of all the HIV movement has overcome. In the 1980s, the government refused to acknowledge HIV as gay men died young. Once powerful treatments were available in the 1990s and early 2000s, the public health establishment largely neglected Black people with HIV, especially in the South. In that period, the demographics of the epidemic shifted away from white, upper- and middle-class gay populations in liberal states. Half of new diagnoses today are in the South and a third are among people with low incomes.
When Sturdevant first tested positive for HIV in 2005, he didn’t seek treatment. He kept his diagnosis hidden from friends and family because he knew how people talked about HIV. They considered it a death sentence, a punishment for irresponsible behavior, or a disease that could infect them through a touch or a shared toilet seat — which it cannot.
“I thought my family was going to disown me,” he said.
A year later, his weight plummeted because he couldn’t hold down food or water. Gaunt and feverish, he went to the hospital and learned he had AIDS. His mother slept at his hospital bedside for two weeks: “She said, ‘God got you.’”
Once he regained his health, Sturdevant resolved to care for others in his position. Scientists had developed powerful HIV drugs that, if taken daily, transform it from a death sentence into a manageable chronic disease in which a person’s virus levels are so suppressed that they cannot spread HIV to others. And policymakers ensured that almost everyone in the U.S. with HIV could get treated regardless of their ability to pay, largely because of Medicaid and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.
But HIV experts had failed to overcome a key problem: Roughly a third of people living with HIV in the U.S. don’t get treated or don’t take the drugs regularly enough to be virally suppressed. Viral suppression rates are better in many African countries than in America.

To seek treatment and stick with it, Sturdevant understood, people had to have basic needs like food and housing met and, as importantly, a sense of belonging and empowerment. At his first job at an HIV organization in Jackson, Mississippi, Sturdevant regularly checked in with clients who didn’t have family members to support them. He hosted gatherings at his apartment and even offered it up as a place to stay. He has taken on the role of dad or uncle to many. “We called ourselves the family of love,” he said.
He saw how care bolstered lives, but the federal government needed data to drive its approach to HIV.
In 2012, the CDC expanded its in-depth surveys to learn more about the lives of people at risk of HIV and of those with HIV who weren’t virally suppressed. The surveys revealed what Sturdevant knew: A disproportionate number of them grappled with unstable housing, food insecurity, depression, and anxiety. Many participants agreed to prompts like, “Having HIV makes me feel that I’m a bad person,” or “Most people think that a person with HIV is disgusting,” or “Most people with HIV are rejected.”
The data showed policymakers that to curb the epidemic, they needed to address underlying problems that people with HIV faced. Federal funds began to flow to grassroots groups embedded in marginalized communities.
Public health researchers folded Black churches into the effort, recognizing them as hubs of volunteerism and as leaders of social movements. Although churches in the U.S. had historically fueled stigma against sexually transmitted diseases, Amy Nunn, a public health researcher at Brown University, said every pastor she talked with was eager to help. It paid off. In Kansas City, for example, researchers found that congregants who went to Black churches involved in HIV education and outreach were more than twice as likely to be tested.
Community-based interventions worked: New HIV infections dropped by 12% from 2018 to 2022.
Now the grassroots groups that have been so effective are in jeopardy and the in-depth surveys have halted as the Trump administration cuts funds and lays off CDC staff. Some health departments have issued stop-work orders to community-based groups that test people for HIV and connect them to treatment because federal HIV grants are unusually delayed. And as the Department of Health and Human Services continues to cancel HIV grants, the directors of grassroots groups anticipate more cuts.
“A lot of them are new and don’t have the resources to survive a year without funding,” said Masen Davis, executive director of Funders Concerned About AIDS.
One such group is Sturdevant’s.

‘Trust the process?’
In 2017, Sturdevant returned home to the Mississippi Delta to launch a nonprofit, Community Health PIER, in one of the poorest and most medically underserved parts of the country. The average life expectancy in the Delta is 68, a decade shorter than the national average. The disenfranchisement of its majority-Black population stems from the region’s history, in which policies concentrated wealth and power among the minority-white population during the era of cotton sharecropping, Jim Crow laws and segregation, and, recently, due to gerrymandering.
 
Sturdevant set up shop in Greenville, near a Black church that served as a headquarters for civil rights activists in the 1960s. In a small office, his team organizes health events, tests people for HIV, and connects those who test positive with treatment and housing assistance, funded through federal programs like Ryan White.
“Whites have been getting Ryan White and other programs for years and living healthy,” said Ashley Richardson, administrative assistant of Sturdevant’s group. “Around here, Black people are just now getting to the point where we know there are resources to help.”
Lately the team fields calls from people with HIV who are terrified they will lose their lifesaving drugs and housing if government programs no longer help with the cost.
Sturdevant worries about keeping his staff employed and his community safe. On the drive home from the April event in Washington, he drearily recounted conversations with Republicans in Congress: “They basically all said trust the process.”
The heads of national HIV organizations have stepped up their advocacy, asking Congress to oppose cuts in President Donald Trump’s budget request, said Gregorio Millett, director of public policy at the Foundation for AIDS Research, a nonprofit known as amfAR.
Emily Hilliard, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, responded to queries from KFF Health News by writing, “Critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue under the Administration for a Healthy America.” Yet the administration’s proposed budget for HIV prevention represents a 78% reduction compared with fiscal year 2025, according to a KFF analysis.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fostered skepticism  about scientific facts concerning HIV, without citing evidence. “Any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable-even dangerous-heresy among our reigning medical cartel,” he wrote in a 2021 book.
Not bowing to barriers
Researchers and HIV advocates are hashing out strategies to fill in the vacuum in HIV care that the government is poised to leave. For decades, it has driven priorities, coordinated a constellation of HIV groups, and tracked the epidemic. Leisha McKinley-Beach, CEO of a training institute, Black Public Health Academy, in Atlanta, said people must remember that wasn’t always the case.
“This massive industry we have today was created by committed individuals at the grassroots level, who were going to help people live with HIV or die with dignity, by any means necessary,” she said.
One idea is to have larger, established HIV organizations partner with nascent groups in underserved regions. The bigger ones stand a better chance of garnering significant private donations. And by taking on the fiscal management of grants, large groups could enable small ones to devote time to service rather than fundraising, McKinley-Beach said.
Another strategy, said Kathy Garner, executive director of Mississippi’s AIDS Services Coalition, is to fill gaps by coordinating with churches and nonprofits dedicated to food assistance, housing, or mental health.
“One of the solutions is going to be civil society stepping up,” Garner said. “That’s an old term for people taking care of each other, outside of the government.”
 
“We’re going to need to ramp up our services in all kinds of ways, and health and HIV will be a part of that,” said Bishop Ronnie Crudup of New Horizon Church International in Jackson, and a member of Mississippi Faith in Action, a coalition of African American churches involved in HIV.
“I have real concerns with what the Trump administration is doing, and how it will play out for the health of people in a poor state,” he said.
National groups, such as AIDS United, have been speaking with corporate funders and philanthropies about building a pooled fund to help sustain HIV organizations across the U.S.
Philanthropy for HIV has never come close to matching federal dollars, however. Non-governmental funders put $284 million toward HIV in the U.S. in 2023, compared with about $16 billion in annual federal funds for HIV in recent years.
“The truth is there is no way for philanthropy to make up for the cuts from the federal government,” Davis said. “I suspect we will see new infections rise within 18 months, which is heartbreaking.”
Sturdevant focuses on survival, not forecasts. “This isn’t going to be easy,” he said, “but we need to keep fighting for those who don’t have the fight in them.”

Retail fireworks sales started Tuesday ahead of Independence Day (July 4), with sales able to continue through July 5 on a July license, according to state law. The same law required such seasonal retail license applications — now $100 per stand, instead of $25 — to be received no later than June 9.
Other fireworks aficionados are also paying higher fees this season, such as jobbers at $400 (up from $200) and distributors at $1,000 (up from $500).

  State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who led the proposed fee increases through Legislative Bill 434 this year at the request of the State Fire Marshal’s Office, said this spring that the fees were a “critical need that has been overlooked for far too long.”
Wordekemper said, for instance, that some of the fire marshal’s state fees had not been changed since the 1980s or 1990s. The increases, he said, still wouldn’t keep up with the actual costs of such services.
“These fee increases are not taken lightly, but they are necessary to ensure the continued operation of vital safety services that protect our communities, schools, hospitals and businesses,” Wordekemper said in April.
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, vice chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, gave Wordekemper’s bill a boost on the floor saying that the alternative would be more funds from the state’s main pocketbook, fueled by sales and income taxes. She said the fee increases would not touch family homes.
Armendariz noted there is some “sticker shock” to some of the increases, but she and Wordekemper said that might not have been the case if the fees were more regularly updated.

In the process, however, they also waded into a latent dispute between local leaders in the capital city and the state’s rural northwestern hills, as well as two rival companies competing for rights to haul the trash produced by thousands of Connecticut residents.
The ramifications of that action — which passed with little note or fanfare at the time — have played out over the past week in a boardroom a few miles away from the ornate state Capitol Building.
In early June, as part of their latest two-year budget package, lawmakers voted to formally transfer ownership of the former Materials Innovation Recycling Authority, or MIRA, plant in Hartford’s South Meadows neighborhood to the Capital Region Development Authority, a quasi-public state agency that has overseen the redevelopment of other downtown projects and the management of two sports facilities, the XL Center and Rentschler Field.
During its final few decades as a waste-to-energy plant, the MIRA facility burned upwards of 700,000 tons of trash a year from residents in the Greater Hartford area and beyond. Before that it burned petroleum — and earlier, coal — to produce power.
As of now, neither the city nor the state have firm plans for the site, which exists on 80 acres along the Connecticut River. Officials, however, say their options include a mix of industrial, commercial or, if enough money is made available, residential uses.
“What is pretty clear is it’s not going to be a power plant,” said Michael Freimuth, the executive director of CRDA. “From there it’s pretty open.”
As part of the transfer, CRDA will inherit up to $47 million in reserves from the plant’s current owner, the MIRA Dissolution Authority, that was established in 2023 to wind down operations at South Meadows and other facilities operated by its predecessor. 
Those funds will be held in a separate account controlled by CRDA and used exclusively for the maintenance, cleanup and potential demolition of the power plant site, according to the legislation. Two full-time engineers currently employed at the site will also be hired CRDA as part of the move.
The MIRA Dissolution Authority itself will cease to exist as of midnight on July 1. As a result, its board has been involved in flurry of meetings at its office in the South Meadows regarding the remaining funds along with services at its two regional transfer stations.
“This site has for over a century, been a sort of dumping ground for the broader region,” said Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam. “Even in kind of industrial times, in the 19th Century, ships, commercial ships, would dump stuff in on that site.”
The result of that history, the mayor said, is a level environmental contamination that is sure to complicate any efforts to redevelop the property. For generations, children who grew up adjacent to the plant’s fuming smokestacks have reported higher rates of asthma.
“Now that it’s been shut down, we’re going to be left trying to figure out what will happen next,” Arulampalam said.
‘Immaculate Amendment’
Apart from the former waste-to-energy facility in Hartford, the MIRA Dissolution Authority also owns and operates a transfer station in Torrington as well as buildings and equipment at the town of Essex’s transfer station.
Determining the future of those two those stations — which collectively serve 23 mostly-smaller towns, and handle roughly 63,000 tons of trash annually — has been part of the authority’s work for the past two years. For Essex, a relatively straightforward plan was approved this week to transfer the remainder of MIRA’s property to the town, which will operate the plant under an existing contract with CWPM Waste Management.
In Torrington, however, dueling proposals to either sell the transfer station or keep it operating as a public facility have split local leaders in Hartford and the state’s Northwest Corner.
Under a so-called “private option,” the transfer station would be leased or sold to an Enfield company, USA Waste and Recycling, for $3.25 million. That money, in turn, would have been added to the reserves available to remediate the site of MIRA’s shuttered waste-to-energy plant in Hartford.
But several towns in that area have expressed concerns about rising tipping fees and USA Waste’s growing presence in the local trash-hauling industry. That’s led some local leaders to propose creating their own regional waste authority to take over the transfer station — the alternative “public option.”
During meeting in May, several members of the MIRA Dissolution Authority said that while they support the desire for the public option, getting such a regional authority up and running would have required an estimated $4.4 million in subsidies from MIRA’s remaining reserves.
As a result, the board voted to support selling the transfer station, pending a final round of negotiations with USA Waste and Recycling.
Then, a few weeks later amid the frenetic rush to wrap-up this year’s legislative session, an amendment was added to the state’s sprawling budget bill that transferred the Torrington station’s operating permit to the towns’ newly-created Northwest Resource Recovery Authority — throwing a wrench into MIRA Dissolution Authority’s plan to sell the facility.
In addition to the Torrington transfer station, the amendment also added language directing the commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to issue a temporary operating permit to the owner of a transfer station in Wallingford. 
Multiple lawmakers — including leaders of all four legislative caucuses — told the Connecticut Mirror this week they were unaware of the exact origins of the permit language, which will go into effect when once Gov. Ned Lamont signs the budget into law as expected.
“I call it the immaculate amendment,” said Bert Hunter, the chair of MIRA Dissolution Authority’s board of directors.
On Friday, however, the provenance of that amendment became clearer when Joseph Mazzarella, a lawyer and partner at McCarter & English, said he wrote letters seeking its inclusion to Courtney Cullinan and Franklin Perry, the chiefs of staff, respectively, for the Senate and House Democratic majorities.
Mazzarella said he was acting on behalf of a client, Richard Antonucci Jr. of waste services operator Country Holdings LLC., who he said has been fighting to establish a presence in the region’s trash disposal and recycling business in competition with USA Waste and its affiliates. Mazzarella acknowleged that the language was intended to block the sale of the Torrington transfer station to his client’s rival, which he said would have resulted in the further consolidation of the trash business.
“How can that be good?” Mazzarella said.
McCarter & English also employs the Senate Democrats former chief of staff, Vincent Mauro, as a government affairs adviser. He referred questions to Mazzarella.
Prior to speaking to Mazzarella, CT Mirror asked Senate Democrats’ chief of staff Cullinan about the language that was inserted into the budget. “I heard about it, but I am not necessarily familiar with it,” she said, and promised to look into the matter.
Later, CT Mirror reached out again to Cullinan again to ask about the letters Mazzarella said he sent her. Cullinan responded in a text offering to share a copy of the letter, but did not say whether she took any action in response to it.
Perry, the House Democrats’ chief of staff, did not respond to a request for comment.
In addition to its interest in the Torrington facility, Mazzarella said Country Holdings purchased a site in Wallingford that once housed a trash incinerator — and later, a transfer station — which had accumulated waste under the control of a previous operator, drawing a notice of violation by DEEP. 
The language inserted in the budget restored the Wallingford facility’s operating permit to Country Holdings — further easing the company’s attempts to establish a regional presence in recycling and waste disposal.
Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, a long-serving lawmaker and environmentalist, said Friday she was uncertain if the end result of the maneuver ultimately would be deemed good public policy. “Too soon to tell. I put a call into DEEP to see what they think as regulators,” Mushinsky said.
But she had no qualms in criticizing the method employed.
“They snuck it in. We only get a couple of hours” to review the final budget document, she said. “Sometimes people sneak things in at the last minute, and that’s what happened here.”
In a statement Friday evening, DEEP spokesman James Fowler said the agency neither negotiated nor reviewed the language prior to its inclusion in the budget. He added that the agency is working with the Department of Administrative Services to “facilitate the continued operation” of the Torrington facility, while reviewing the language involving the Wallingford facility with the offices of the governor and the attorney general.
The move also frustrated officials in Hartford, including Arulampalam, who said it in effect took away the $3.25 million the sale would have generated for cleanup efforts in the city’s South Meadows neighborhood.
Hunter, meanwhile, said the MIRA Dissolution Authority board had examined a number of pathways to move forward with either the public or private option following the legislature’s action. But due to the legal complexities and sudden costs involved, the board on Thursday decided to take no action on either proposal.
As a result, the Torrington transfer station will automatically revert to the state’s Department of Administrative Services on July 1. Its continued operations will be left up to the agency, leaving the door open for Country Holdings to bid for any future contracts.
“We didn’t take a vote. We just had a sense that we just couldn’t, we couldn’t get there,” Hunter said. “There was just not it wasn’t enough support [for either proposal]”
The shift is not expected to impact trash-hauling operations for the time being, Hunter said. A spokesman for DAS said Friday that the state’s “commitment is to ensure secure and efficient continuity of all operations, including the Torrington transfer station, in accordance with all statutes and regulations. We continue to work closely with DEEP and other partners and contractors to meet that commitment.” 
The chief executive of USA Waste and Recycling did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. But the company’s attorney, Ed Spinella, ripped into lawmakers’ “rat amendment” during a meeting of the MIRA Dissolution Authority’s board on June 18.
“We were going to buy the [Torrington] facility regardless of whether or not it had a permit,” Spinella said, promising to hold the board to its earlier vote supporting the private option. “It’s an enforceable vote, and I guarantee you I’m going to make in enforceable.”
Neither the leader of the Northwest Hills Council of Governments, Robert Phillips, or Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone responded to requests for comment on Friday.
Cleaning up
The MIRA plant was originally built in the 1920s to provide power to the growing city of Hartford. Later, in the 1980s, it was reconfigured to offer a solution to another one of the state’s vexing problems: trash piling up in stinking, unsightly landfills. By the late 2010s, however, the age of the facility and competition with cheaper power sources made it uneconomical to run. Operations at the plant finally ceased on July 19, 2022.
Since then, the MIRA Dissolution Authority has worked with DEEP to remediate the property to an industrial or commercial standard, according to Hunter. Contaminants on the site include asbestos, lead paint and chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
Any future development plans that involve tearing down the hulking former power plant, or digging up contaminated soils to build the foundation for new buildings, are expected to drive up the cost of that remediation, officials say. 
Freimuth, the director of CRDA, compared the task to one undertaken by the authority’s predecessor in the mid-2000s to redevelop a section of Hartford now known as Adriaen’s Landing, home to a hotel, convention center and the Connecticut Science Center.
“This area that I’m sitting in right now [was] very similar in characteristics to what the South Meadows looks like: an energy area, tank farms, coal slurry, you know, all kinds of stuff,” Freimuth said. “The logic was: this is very similar to the tasks and the process, so let’s use the agency that did it once before.”
In March, the MIRA Dissolution Authority released a 1,535-page report on the potential for future development at the South Meadows site. That report estimated that demolition and cleanup of the site would cost between $48 million and $334 million, with the highest estimates associated with plans that included multifamily housing.
Due to those likely costs, some local leaders have said plans should instead focus on industrial and commercial uses that have long found a home in the South Meadows.
“It’s probably too expensive to be residential,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford. “It’s probably going to be a long haul.” 
Mayor Arulampalam, however said he wanted planners to look at creative solutions — such as capping the most polluted sections of the property with parking lots, while leaving others open to more expansive development — which could keep costs down.
“Are there open-space uses for parts of the property?” Arulampalam said. “Is there some mixture of commercial and residential that could kind of work in tandem, and based on the physical design features, maybe help mitigate some of the larger costs of remediation?”
Adding to the complexity of redeveloping the site is its location adjacent to the Hartford-Brainard Airport, which mostly serves smaller, civil aircraft. The legislation transferring ownership of the plant to CRDA prohibits the authority from taking any action that would conflict with federal laws or regulations concerning the airport.
“Realistically, you’ve got height restrictions and things of that nature, that you have to accommodate for,” Freimuth said, adding that it would likely be another three to five years before actual development could begin on the property. 
While Arulampalam said he was disappointed by lawmakers’ decision to block the sale of the Torrington property, he said he was supportive of the broader decision to endow CRDA with a $47 million to move forward with the long-awaited cleanup of the MIRA plant.
“In many ways, in a small snapshot, you could focus on the $3.25 million that city lost out on, and it feels frustrating to me as mayor to have had that happen,” Arulampalam said. 
But, he added, “This story has played out in numerous places like Hartford across the country, and typically there isn’t any effort to remedy the wrongs of the past.
“I think this is a real win for environmental justice. I think it’s a real win for some form of repairing this massive environmental contaminant that the city of Hartford has had to bear the brunt of for the region for far too long. It’s not a full victory, but it is more of a victory than cities like us usually get,” Arulampalam said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MIRA-DISSOLUTION-0630-DE-108-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 06:58:41.726367

A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon attend an event for the Make America Healthy Again Commission report in the East Room of the White House on May 22, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Our nation’s founders embraced equality as a guiding principle in the Declaration of Independence with these words: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights.”
Abraham Lincoln gave meaning to the founders’ words while on the campaign trail in 1857; he countered the infamous Dred Scott decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared that persons imported from Africa, whether free or enslaved, were not American citizens.
Lincoln responded that the nation’s founders saw equality as an aspiration of American democracy:
“They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society … constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.”
Critical steps in removing barriers to equality would be taken through constitutional change only after a bitterly fought Civil War. Three post-war amendments sought to make people of color in the US more equal, specifically:

The 13th Amendment (1865) abolishing slavery;
the 14th Amendment (1868) providing that all persons born or naturalized in the US, including formerly enslaved persons, are citizens and are guaranteed equal protection under the law; and
the 15th Amendment (1870) specifying that US citizens shall not be denied the right to vote on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.

Major steps toward advancing equality were taken in the 20th century through Social Security (1935), Medicare (1965) and Medicaid (1965).
The Social Security Act equalizes access to income support for seniors, the unemployed, families with dependent children and people with disabilities. Seventy-million Americans rely on Social Security benefits each month, and nearly 590,000 Kansans receive monthly benefits through social security.
Medicare equalizes access to health care primarily for seniors and disabled persons, and Medicaid equalizes access to health care for poor and disabled persons. Seventy-million Americans are now enrolled in Medicare, and 70 million Americans are covered by Medicaid. More than 570,000 Kansans are enrolled in Medicare, and more than 350,000 Kansans are covered by Medicaid.
The nation has made historic commitments to equalize access to civil rights, specifically through:

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which guarantees access to public accommodations, education and employment for those discriminated against as a result of race, color, religion, sex or national origin;
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, which assures access to the ballot box for those denied access as a result of race or color; and
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which provides access to employment, public accommodations, transportation and telecommunications for persons with disabilities.

President Donald Trump has declared war on equality as an aspiration for American democracy. He has twisted civil rights protections inside out: from safeguards intended to uphold the rights of people of color, women, and disabled persons to a protection for white men.
Trump has ordered that:

Initiatives in diversity, equity, and inclusion are illegal and immoral and should be terminated both within and outside of government;
Evidence of inequalities in the form of “disparate impact” be banned from use in determining discrimination against minority groups and people of color;
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stop assisting state and local civil rights offices from investigating discrimination based on disparate impact; and
The Department of Justice “modify, rescind, or move to conclude” consent decrees or agreements designed to eliminate racial discrimination in local police departments and as a result such measures were subsequently abandoned.

Trump appointees have turned civil rights offices in departments of Justice, Education, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission away from addressing claims of discrimination by people of color and women toward complaints against measures that advance diversity, equity, and inclusion for such groups. They have also used federal grants and contracts as leverage to force schools, colleges and universities to abandon initiatives related to diversity, equity and inclusion, whether federally funded or not, and terminate grants or contracts concerned with equity.
In Trump’s world, even the celebration of achievement of those from marginalized groups is viewed as diminishing white people.
Our nation’s drive for equality over two and a half centuries now permeates our government and institutions throughout society. Trump acts out of ignorance against our determination and may temporarily disrupt progress. I remain confident, however, that he can never bend the arc of history away from our aspiration for equality.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trumprfkmcmahon-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 05:00:27.822190

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Budget panels in both chambers of the Legislature in late-night votes Friday approved an annual spending bill that Senate Democrats have said will cost $58.8 billion.
Legislators’ proposal spends more than the plan Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled in late February, leaves the state with a surplus too small to meet a statutory requirement for a new tax relief program, and expands New Jersey’s deficit to $1.5 billion (Murphy proposed $1.2 billion).
If the budget stands at $58.8 billion, it would amount to the highest level in state history. The full Legislature is expected to give the plan a final vote on Monday. The next fiscal year begins Tuesday.
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) on Friday read aloud a statement from an absent Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair.
“This is a budget that will help move New Jersey forward in the face of difficult fiscal conditions and severe economic uncertainty. We are making the best use of resources to address the priority needs of the state’s residents in a fiscally responsible way,” the statement read. 
On net, lawmakers’ changes to Murphy’s proposed budget add $728 million in spending beyond what the governor sought, and while the total effect of their revenue raisers was not immediately clear, the state appears poised to take in less money from recurring revenue than under the governor’s proposal.
Republican officials, in what has become a yearly rejoinder, criticized the late-night budget votes, which were held before bill text was available to the public. Members of the press received copies of the spending bill at 8:37 p.m. Friday, but the bills were not posted online Friday.
“It’s the complete opposite of what good government looks like,” said Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris). “Their rushed, opaque budget charade is exactly why New Jersey is in the fiscal mess we’ve found ourselves in. There’s no accountability, no planning, and absolutely no transparency, just last-minute deals and political favors pushed through in the dead of night when no one is looking.”
 Sen. Anthony Bucco criticized legislative leaders for delaying a vote on the annual budget until late Friday. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Friday’s vote by the Senate’s budget committee capped an unusual process that began when the panel met on Thursday but ended its meeting without a vote on the budget. Instead of adjourning, the committee took a 24-hour-long recess that allowed members who would not be present Friday, like Sarlo, to record their votes early on a budget bill that did not yet exist.
Witnesses and lawmakers praised the budget’s full $7.2 billion pension payment, and the more than $12 billion it sets aside for formulaic school aid. However, some expressed concern that the state would still spend more than it brings in.
“I appreciate the responsible side of this budget where it’s full pension payment, it’s a full school aid payment, a healthier surplus than we’re used to, but there’s no signs of the structural reforms we truly need to give our next governor a healthier budget,” said Chris Emigholz, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), her chamber’s budget chair, said the state’s next governor, who will take office in January, would need to determine whether some programs should be jettisoned. Murphy is barred from seeking a third term in November.
“Whoever comes in, I think that there’s going to be some decisions that are going to have to be made. I think whether it’s a Republican or a Democrat, they’re going to have to take a look at especially some of the senior proposals just to see what we can do,” she said.
Much of the new spending comes from legislative add-ons — variably called district spending, Christmas tree items, or simply “pork.”
Those items are numerous and varied, and their costs total in the hundreds of millions. They include millions in capital funding to individual school districts, like the $21 million Newark schools will receive, or for local infrastructure projects, like $8 million set aside for roadway improvements in Camden.
Other changes would undo cuts to college financial assistance for students and reverse a $20 million cut Murphy proposed to community colleges’ operating aid. Those cuts had rankled lawmakers and spurred alarm from university leaders.
The budget would pull an additional $70 million from the state’s clean energy fund to pay for salaries at NJ Transit, plus an additional $50 million to underwrite more general state spending. NJ Transit was already set to receive a separate $70.1 million from the fund as part of an annual diversion.
The bill assumes the state will find $100 million in savings on state employees’ health care benefits in the first six months of 2026, though it provides no suggestion for how officials realize such savings. Instead, it asks state and public employee representatives to each submit their own plans.
The boosted spending would take the state’s surplus to $6.7 billion, according to budget documents that had not undergone technical review by the Office of Legislative Services.
Lawmakers augmented reserves by increasing a diversion from a debt defeasance fund — which is meant to reduce debt payments by immediately paying debt down or avoiding it altogether — to $555 million, from $250 million.
The proposed level of surplus should trigger a statutory provision to pause payments from Stay NJ, a nascent property tax relief program that promises to cut seniors’ property tax bills in half. The provision is intended to halt the program if the state doesn’t have enough money to pay for it, but lawmakers have previously overwritten it.
The budget includes a range of new or increased taxes, including a hike to rates paid on cigarettes, electronic cigarette fluid, high-dollar property sales, and casinos’ online wagering wins.
Lawmakers followed Murphy’s lead on nicotine taxes, exactly matching proposals he made in his budget message, but approved lower tax rates for casinos’ online wagering wins than the governor had sought. Those rates rise to 19.75% in lawmakers’ budget plan, rather than the 25% Murphy pitched.
Legislators made broader changes to a surcharge on realty transfers of more than $1 million.
Rather than doubling that tax rate to 2% and imposing a 3% rate on property sales worth more than $2 million, legislators voted to raise rates to 2% for sales worth between $2 million and $2.5 million and increase them by an additional half percentage point for every $500,000 in additional value, to a cap of 3.5% at $3.5 million.
Their proposal also calls for property sellers, rather than buyers, to pay the fee, a change that would decrease upfront costs for those buying buildings worth at least $1 million and reduce the profits from such property sales.
Legislators eschewed some taxes sought by Murphy. They skipped a proposed 10% hike to the state’s alcoholic beverage tax that was forecast to boost collections by $18.5 million. They also declined to enact a per-truck warehousing fee estimated to generate $20 million in revenue.
A degree of uncertainty remains around the budget. GOP lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are exploring broad changes to federal programs that could pull billions in federal Medicaid funding, among other things, from New Jersey.
“In many ways, this budget may be a hypothetical document,” said Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “When those cuts start coming, we’ll have to come up with the revenue somewhere. Otherwise, we will face devastating cuts to many of the programs that we all hold dear.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0JS11345_1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-28 02:59:59.733848

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, coupled with an executive order by President Donald Trump, has created doubt about the future of American citizenship for Alaskans who are the children of immigrants.
In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that U.S. District Court judges cannot issue nationwide preliminary injunctions.
In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring that the federal government would end birthright citizenship — the awarding of American citizenship to every person born in the United States — for the children of non-citizen immigrants. 
The new Supreme Court decision has significant implications for Alaska in particular, because it is not among the states that have legal challenges against Trump’s executive order.
Since 1898, the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted by courts as offering birthright citizenship to the children of all American residents, regardless of immigration status. 
Trump’s order would change the federal government’s interpretation. It declares that citizenship would be limited to the children of citizens and lawful permanent residents, which would exclude refugees, and other people in the United States temporarily, as well as undocumented immigrants.
That change has been blocked nationwide since January by numerous district court judges.
Friday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court means that those judges can no longer block the order nationwide; they can only block it in states whose district courts are considering lawsuits that challenge the Trump order.
As of Friday, 22 states have legal challenges against the Trump order. 
Twenty-eight states, including Alaska, have not. In those states, the Trump administration can start, in 30 days, to begin implementing the executive order, the court said.
The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Trump administration’s executive order, which could be overturned at a later date.
Neither the office of Gov. Mike Dunleavy nor Attorney General Treg Taylor answered emailed questions asking whether they intend to file a lawsuit in order to protect newborn Alaskans’ citizenship.
Mara Kimmel, the executive director of the Alaska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said by email that her organization “anticipates this decision could have devastating impacts in Alaska and we are monitoring this very closely as we determine a path forward to protect Alaskan families.”
Meghan Barker, communications and engagement director for the ACLU of Alaska, said that the ACLU nationally has already filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to represent people nationwide, including Alaskans.
“We’re closely following the situation and litigation to ensure that no Alaskans lose their citizenship,” she said.

MCSO is currently exploring an agreement with Biometrica, a data company that provides facial recognition technology to local police departments. 
“Facial recognition technology has been proven to disproportionately affect communities of color and young women,” said Sup. Juan Miguel Martinez. “The more facial recognition technology, the more people are able to criminalize people executing their First Amendment rights. I feel this is an issue not left or right.” Miguel Martinez also expressed concerns about the use of facial recognition technology to aid immigration enforcement or to surveil protests. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Privacy concerns have been heightened during the Trump administration’s surge in immigration enforcement and crackdowns on dissent. In Milwaukee, several people were arrested by federal agents after attending regular hearings at the county courthouse. In April, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and accused of obstructing federal agents after she directed a man sought by immigration officers out a side door in her courtroom that led into a public hallway. 
MCSO leaders said they aim to use the technology to identify people after violent crime incidents. 
Nevertheless, members of the public and some elected officials raised concerns about the technology.  The resolution contains language stating  that facial recognition technology can be inaccurate and could negatively affect certain groups including people of color, LGBTQ people, activists, immigrants and people seeking reproductive health care. 
The resolution states that the county board supports pausing any future acquisition of facial recognition until regulatory policies can be developed. It also calls on the county’s Information Management Services Division, Corporation Council and MCSO to collaborate with “relevant stakeholders” including privacy and free speech advocates, in developing that policy framework. Out of this collaborative effort will eventually emerge recommendations to the county board as to whether facial recognition technology:

Should be prohibited or strictly limited without the informed knowledge and consent of the individual being scanned, except under narrowly defined circumstances, such as during active criminal investigations, 
Whether the types of data collected by the technology should be defined and limited, as well as strict retention periods for data, 
Prohibit facial recognition data from being shared with third parties, unless authorized through a rigorous, transparent approval process which itself would be subject to oversight, 
And whether departments using facial recognition should be required to submit annual reports detailing its use, including metrics of deployment, effectiveness, and analysis on the impact on communities of color, immigrants and other vulnerable groups.  

The resolution passed by the county board calls for a final recommendation to be established no later than May 2026. By December 2025 the county board expects a status update, according to the resolution.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon appears poised to leave Congress in early 2027. 
One House Republican strategist who works on campaigns across the country said Bacon was not running for reelection and that he had already telegraphed what he was going to do. He spoke to the Examiner Friday on the condition that he not be named publicly, because he was not authorized to share the decision. 
“Don’t get me wrong,” the consultant said. “This seat is tougher without Bacon, but he’s not special. It can be done.” 
Five other local Republican sources familiar with Bacon’s choice confirmed that he had decided to skip the 2026 race. They echoed Friday evening reports from Washington, D.C., including from Punchbowl News. 
No immediate comment
Bacon’s campaign had no immediate comment on the reports. But people who know politics in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District had been buzzing for days about the possibility of Bacon making a decision as soon as next week. Bacon had planned to meet with local reporters early next week. 
Part of the buzz came from a group of Nebraska Republicans waiting on Bacon’s decision, a list that local conservatives have said includes former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding, and might also include Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei. 
Bacon, in recent interviews with the Nebraska Examiner and other publications, had been hinting that he might step away, with the retired Air Force brigadier saying that he had to speak with his family and decide. Bacon’s decision would cause national political shockwaves, as Bacon represents one of a handful of true swing districts left nationally, one that is Nebraska’s most political divided and diverse. 
Diverse swing district
The 2nd District includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and a significant slice of western suburban and rural Sarpy County. The district includes the state’s largest concentration of Democrats and was redistricted to include a larger swath of Republican-leaning rural voters in Wahoo and surrounding areas. 
Neither the Nebraska Republican Party nor the National Republican Congressional Committee had any immediate comment.
“The writing has been on the wall for months,” said Madison Andrus, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of congressional Democrats. 
Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, tweeted after Punchbowl News’ Jake Sherman tweeted the news that local Democrats have been ready.
“Don Bacon and all the Republicans who give Trump cover see the writing on the wall–voters actually want politicians to focus on issues that impact our pocket books not made up culture wars,” she said. 
Candidates lining up
She touted the Democrats who have already announced, including political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. Before word of Bacon’s future broke on Friday, a third major Democrat confirmed she is considering a bid, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades.
Powell, in a statement, thanks Bacon for his service in the military and in Congress and said it “takes courage to recognize when a fresh perspective is warranted.”
“This district is clearly ready for — and deserves — change,” Powell said.
Cavanaugh, in a statement, thanked Bacon “for his decades of service to his country” and wished him well. 
“The people of Nebraska’s 2nd District know it’s time for a change,” Cavanaugh said.
Rhoades, in a statement, said Bacon had “finally realized what has been obvious to all of us: Republicans can’t defend their record this year.” 
“Costs are going up, they’re cutting healthcare, but they’re giving tax breaks to billionaires,” Rhoades said.
Bacon has been able to fend off multiple Democratic challengers in recent years, thanks in part to the district’s slight GOP tilt. Now, it could be a mad dash for both parties toward an open seat. 
National attention
The retired Air Force brigadier general gained national attention for being one of the few Republicans to criticize President Donald Trump, though, despite Bacon’s criticism, he often ended up siding with his party as a reliable GOP vote. He survived pointed criticism from Trump and multiple attempts to recruit a GOP challenger from the president and his political team. 
Bacon most recently defeated former State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha in back-to-back elections. Before that, he defeated Omaha progressive Kara Eastman in two successive contests. And he won election in 2016 by defeating the last Democrat to hold the “blue dot” seat, the late-U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb.
Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running. 
Whoever emerges from the 2026 Democratic primary will have to tangle with a former gubernatorial candidate in Lindstrom, a longtime City Council member in Harding or perhaps a state officeholder on the Republican side.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report just shifted the Omaha-based House to lean Democrat from lean Republican.

Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, was not recently using an Instagram account responsible for an antisemitic comment. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan issued a statement Friday saying he had “definitive proof” that Del. Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, was not recently using an Instagram account responsible for an antisemitic comment last week. 
McGeehan did not respond to an emailed request to provide that evidence and could not be reached by phone Friday.
In his statement, McGeehan said Masters provided him with a screenshot of the account that showed “irregular activity.” That screenshot was not included in the release and he did not explain specifically what it showed.
McGeehan also claimed that the person who did make the comment from the profile @NoQuarterMasters — which bore Masters’ full name, a link to an organization he ran for about 10 years and a profile picture with a letter addressed to “Ian” surrounded by symbols associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideals — has been identified. 
The responsible person, according to McGeehan, was “someone with no current relation to [Masters] and his district, or anyone else in the WV Republican Party.” He offered no other details.
In his comments Friday, McGeehan called out Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin and Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia — the only two Jewish members of the state Legislature — by name, saying they were “not interested in the truth” about who really left the antisemitic comment.
“They make these deceptive accusations because they desire power and social status at the expense of others,” McGeehan wrote. 
Earlier this week, Pushkin called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey to “show moral leadership” and ask for Masters’ resignation unless evidence could be provided showing definitively that he did not make the comment. The state Democratic Party also urged House Speaker Roger Hanshaw in a letter to “take swift action” against Masters and fully investigate the incident.
On Friday, Pushkin released another statement that questioned why McGeehan did not release the proof. 
“If the responsible party has been ‘identified,’ why has no name been released and no explanation given as to how that determination was made?” Pushkin asked. “Until that happens — and unless that evidence is presented clearly and publicly — McGeehan’s statements amount to little more than a dog whistle meant to distract from serious concerns about antisemitism and white supremacy by a member of the House of Delegates.”
The Instagram account @NoQuarterMasters left the antisemitic comment on a months-old Instagram post about Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy on June 21. The comment said “[Portnoy is] not white. He’s a Jew. We never claimed them. That’s why he’s short tiny and weak.”
  A screenshot taken Monday of the comment left by @NoQuarterMasters three days ago in response to another user’s 10-weeks-old comment on a video about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, denies leaving the comment.
West Virginia Watch first reported the comment and the links between Masters and the profile that left it on Tuesday. In an interview that day, Masters said he did not have “any active Instagram account” and was not responsible for the comment.
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw told MetroNews Talkline on Wednesday that Masters told him he was “previously affiliated” with the @NoQuarterMasters account but wasn’t anymore and denied “having connection” to the antisemitic comment. 
“He was surprised to see it,” Hanshaw said. “When [Masters] and I spoke earlier [Wednesday], he indicated that he could not actually log into the account when he tried to do so because, apparently, the password had been changed and he had to seek technical assistance to even be able to reset a password.”
The last two digits of the phone number used for password recovery on the account were the same as on Masters’ personal cell phone on Tuesday.
During his interview with West Virginia Watch, Masters did not acknowledge any familiarity with the account’s handle or any previous affiliation with it. 
In 2023, multiple Instagram posts from the West Virginia Citizens Defense League — where Masters served as president from 2015 to 2025 — showed captions signed off by “Ian T. Masters, Esq.” and @NoQuarterMasters tagged in photos alongside accounts with the same names of other officers for the organization.
Several photos on his wife’s public Instagram from 2021-23 show photos of Masters tagged as @NoQuarterMasters. 
  Del. Ian T. Masters was tagged in photos as @noquartermasters on his wife’s Instagram account.
Before speaking to West Virginia Watch on Tuesday, the name on the account — separate from the handle — read “Ian T. Masters” and a link to the Citizens Defense League’s website was included in the bio. After the interview but before the story was published that day, the account’s name changed to “I. Masters” and the link was removed. By Tuesday night, the name was changed back to “Ian T. Masters.”
On Tuesday morning, the @NoQuarterMasters profile, which is private, was shown to have 1,498 posts and 367 followers. By 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, the number of posts had dropped to 1,368 — meaning more than 100 posts were deleted — and the follower count dropped to 276. As of Friday afternoon, the account only showed 39 followers.
  Between Tuesday and Friday, Masters’ number of photos decreased by about 100, and his follower count went from 367 to 39.
On Wednesday, the state Democratic Party called on Hanshaw to conduct a “legitimate investigation” into the comment and Masters’ links to the account — including the profile picture that shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in Chester, West Virginia. Per reporting by West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Masters’ LinkedIn says he worked in Chester from 2016-19. 
The letter is partially covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals. 
  A screenshot of the profile picture used on the @NoQuarterMasters Instagram account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in West Virginia and several runes described by the Anti-Defamation League as being associated antisemitic views and groups.
“Keep in mind that Delegate Masters’ Instagram account didn’t just post an antisemitic statement. It also has white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and antisemitic symbols,” Hansen said in a statement Friday.  “Legislative leadership should condemn these actions. And they should perform a full investigation with findings released to the public, rather than trying to turn this into a partisan issue.”
Pushkin earlier this week outlined specific steps that state Democrats say Hanshaw should take to clear Masters’ name, including: performing a “full forensic investigation” of Masters’ devices, social media accounts and email; seeking an explanation of the account’s profile picture and the symbols within it as well as how the name and bio on the account were changed after his interview with West Virginia Watch.
“[G]iven the gravity of what’s alleged, an investigation cannot simply mean asking the Delegate, ‘Did you do it?’ and taking ‘No’ for an answer. We need to get to the truth,” Pushkin said. “West Virginians deserve to know whether an individual chosen to serve in the House of Delegates has used his platform to promote hate, bigotry, and extremism.”
McGeehan on Friday called Pushkin a “professional victim” who was trying to “manipulate” the situation as state Democrats are currently in litigation regarding Masters’ House seat.
Masters was appointed to the House by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in January after delegate-elect Joseph de Soto was accused of threatening to harm and kill lawmakers. Spokespeople for Morrisey have yet to respond to requests for comment regarding the allegations against Masters.
De Soto won the November 2024 election as a Republican but switched his party affiliation to Democratic shortly before being arrested for making terroristic threats. 
House Republicans in January voted to vacate the seat instead of expelling de Soto, saying it was the correct way to deal with the seat since de Soto was on house arrest and never sworn in. The vacate move prompted a legal challenge from the state Democratic Party, who argued that the seat should have gone to Democrats due to de Soto’s party switch.
The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled against state Democrats in one of their challenges over the seat, however other challenges are still pending.

Anthony said renewable power, coupled with battery storage, will “play an important part in power generation in the near future.” (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)In a letter to Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, Gov. Josh Shapiro warned there could be consequences to eliminating clean energy tax credits.
“Over $3 billion in direct investment in Pennsylvania energy projects would be undermined by H.R. 1’s tax increases,” Shapiro wrote. “That includes potential impacts to over 70 facilities that have been announced across the commonwealth, directly threatening more than 26,000 jobs by 2030 due to the effective tax hikes.”
H.R. 1, the budget bill containing many of the Trump administration’s domestic policy priorities, would eliminate a number of tax credits for renewable energy projects, many of which were created by the Democratic-led Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro warned the hardest impact would fall on those slated to open soon. In the House version, most of the clean energy tax credits would end abruptly, instead of in 2032, when they were initially set to expire.
The Senate version is slightly more lenient. Tax credits for wind and solar projects would instead be phased out, with decreasing credits for projects that break ground in 2026 and 2027.
The Senate also moved to keep certain tax credits for nuclear, hydropower, battery and geothermal projects until 2034. Shapiro applauded this change.
Still, he specifically addressed several that have already been announced, which he said could suffer under the changes. That includes two projects in Clearfield County that he noted are collectively anticipated to create more than 900 jobs.
Shapiro said the bill could also effectively end state programs designed to help community institutions lower their energy bills. He said the Solar for Schools program, for example, could potentially lose over $30 million.
The proposed budget also eliminates consumer-focused tax credits for new and used electric vehicle purchases as well as home energy efficiency and clean energy conversion projects.

Bob Ferguson vetoed its funding and the state abruptly canceled its contract. 
And a group of GOP lawmakers is urging Ferguson to find a way to keep the Kent facility operating.
For decades, the Pediatric Interim Care Center has tended to babies born to mothers with substance use disorder. Just under half of its annual $1.7 million budget has usually come from the state, said Development Director Elaine Purchase. Fundraising makes up the rest.
But this year, lawmakers slashed that funding to $100,000 in the face of a steep budget shortfall. The facility, known as PICC, was ready to make do with the deep cut and dip into its reserves, with the hope of making up for it when the Legislature returns next year. 
Then last month, Ferguson vetoed even that $100,000, as part of a slew of small items he removed to save money in the $78 billion two-year spending plan. 
And soon after, Purchase was “blindsided” when the state Department of Children, Youth and Families cut its contract with the nursery, meaning no more babies would be referred there starting July 1.
“Which basically destroys our program,” Purchase said. “Why would they abandon it for $100,000?”
In a statement, the Department of Children, Youth and Families argued the center’s state funding was “not cost-effective.” Secretary Tana Senn said the center received money for its 13 beds regardless of how many babies it was serving, and didn’t meet requirements to get Medicaid funding.
“We also want to clarify that DCYF is not shutting down the Kent PICC,” said Senn, a former state lawmaker. “They can still accept referrals from hospitals and have informed DCYF on multiple occasions that they have sufficient charitable funding to continue serving children.”
On Friday, state House Republican leadership, including Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, of Auburn, took issue with the rationale and urged the state agency and Ferguson to reverse course.
“Governor Ferguson, throughout your first legislative session as governor, you said that you just wanted to do things that are ‘common sense,’” the half-dozen lawmakers wrote. “What is more common sense than using the power you hold to save the lives of innocent newborn babies?”
The facility, open for 35 years, was caring for just one newborn Friday, said Purchase. It has been underused as the focus has shifted to keeping babies with their parents. 
Research has indicated parental involvement is integral in an infant’s development. 
“New evidence-based models demonstrate better outcomes for babies when they ‘room in’ at hospitals under the care of a physician or are in transitional care homes that allow the mother and baby to stay together,” Senn said.
“While hospitals, of course, may choose to continue to refer children to the Kent PICC, they have been doing so much less frequently as demonstrated by the current empty beds at the Kent PICC,” the agency secretary continued. “Instead, hospitals more often refer infants to other facilities that use the current standard of care.”
In 2021, the Legislature passed a measure known as the Keeping Families Together Act to help relatives take care of children who can’t stay with their parents and to reduce racial disparities in the child welfare system. Critics blame the bipartisan law for a reported increase in child deaths, including from drug exposure.
The average stay for babies at the Kent pediatric care center is 30 to 40 days. Most are exposed to fentanyl or methamphetamine. Since opening in 1990, the facility says it has cared for over 3,500 babies.
“We just want there to be a safe place for these little ones,” Purchase said.











The governor did not provide comment on Friday, with a spokesperson for his office referring to the statement from the Department of Children, Youth and Families.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/baby-mom-child.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 20:02:04.565167

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Utah News Dispatch claimed 12 awards, including four first-place wins, in this year’s Utah Headliners statewide journalism contest, which recognizes top journalism in writing and reporting, TV, radio and online news.
The highly competitive local journalism contest drew more than 1,200 entries, said Emma Penrod, president of the Utah Headliners, the state’s professional chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. 
Entries featured work published in 2024, Utah News Dispatch’s first year reporting since launching Jan. 9, 2024. The Dispatch’s four-person team competed in the large newsroom division, squaring off with the largest and longest-running news outlets in the state.
The Utah News Dispatch voter guide won the contest’s inaugural “News you can use” category, with judges saying: “An interactive, stellar example of service journalism, this piece excels in delivering practical, timely information that empowers readers to engage in the democratic process.”
Reporter Kyle Dunphey won this year’s continuing coverage award for his dogged reporting on the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which since 1990 had compensated eligible residents in Western states who were made sick by radiation from U.S. weapons testing and development in the ’50s and ’60s but lapsed last summer when Congress failed to take action to continue it.
The judges said: “While a smaller media site, the Utah News Dispatch did an exemplary job of explaining why RECA is so important and how the legislation’s future could affect so many. It was consequential and well-executed, making politics in DC a meat-and-potatoes issue for so many Utahns. Well done!”
Senior Reporter Katie McKellar claimed two first-place wins. Her profile of innovative homeless service provider Switchpoint and its accountability-focused model won the Homelessness and Housing category, and she led the Longform Storytelling entries with her heartfelt report on a Utah man’s horseback ride across the country to spotlight the crisis facing wild mustangs.
McKellar was also recognized with an honorable mention in the prestigious Best News Reporter category.

Gov. Phil Scott signed a package of changes to Vermont’s election procedures into law this week, among them an expansion of who has to file campaign finance disclosure forms and a restriction on candidates running in a general election who’ve lost a preceding primary election.
The changes are part of a bill, H.474, that nearly did not make it over the finish line this year. The House and Senate approved the bill on the final day of this year’s legislative session, June 16. Before that, though, the legislation appeared all but dead after Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, tied its political fate to an unrelated charter change proposal he was backing that sought to ban guns from bars in Burlington. 
With the charter change languishing in a key House committee, Baruth told the chair of a key Senate committee, which was reviewing the election bill, to pump the brakes — months after the election bill had already cleared the House. Two weeks later, though, following legislators’ partial recess in early June, Senate leaders brought the bill onto the floor for a vote — a decision one House leader credited, at least in part, to VTDigger’s reporting on the political dealing behind the scenes.
Senators cut a number of measures from the bill as it passed in the House, including a study of using ranked-choice voting in Vermont for future presidential primaries. The slimmed-down bill included all the “must-have” provisions identified by the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, a key backer of the legislation, according to Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, who chaired the Senate panel that reviewed the bill. 
Here are the key measures that did make it into the 30-page law, which also sets out a new reporting requirement for certain write-in candidates and updates rules on who must report on donations to campaigns, among a number of other changes.
Campaign finance disclosures
The law eliminates a measure currently on the books stating that only candidates who raise or spend $500 or more have to file campaign finance disclosure forms with the Secretary of State’s Office. Those forms allow the public to review how much candidates have raised and from whom, and how much they’ve spent and on what.
Now, anyone running for office will have to file a disclosure form — regardless of how much they raise or spend. If that amount is less than $500, they’ll have to formally attest to the state that they haven’t surpassed that ceiling. If they raise or spend more than that, the state’s existing rules requiring more detailed disclosure filings would kick in. 
Deputy Secretary of State Lauren Hibbert said her office regularly fields complaints from the public about candidates who, the complainants allege, have raised or spent more than $500 but haven’t disclosed any such information to the state. She said the office has little ability to track down potential scofflaws now, and hopes the new changes will create more accountability.
‘One bite’ candidacy
More controversial, though, was a portion of the law that now prevents a candidate who loses a primary election under the banner of one political party from running again in the general election under a different party label — or as an independent candidate.
The Secretary of State’s Office did not stake out a position for or against that change to restrict what’s often called “getting a second bite at the apple,” according to Hibbert. But while backers of the measure said it would make elections more fair, opponents said the changes were wrongly limiting the options voters could choose from on the ballot. 
On the House floor earlier this month, independent and Progressive members spoke against the change, and it drew the most debate, by far, of any section of the bill. The measure does not do away with so-called “fusion” candidates, however, which are those who get an endorsement from multiple parties on the general election ballot. 
Some senators were opposed to the “one bite” change, too. 
“I don’t think it harms anyone to allow this,” said Washington County Sen. Andrew Perchlik, who’s a Democrat/Progressive, during debate about the bill on that chamber’s floor earlier this month, before it was passed. For prospective independent candidates, specifically, “I think it’s an anti-democratic change,” he added. 
Write-in candidates
The new law also creates a requirement that write-in candidates for state and federal office in Vermont formally declare their candidacy with local or state officials. The change is designed to reduce the workload election officials have to take on, Hibbert said, especially when they’re tasked with tallying write-in votes that include what seem to be protest or joke votes for national figures or fictional characters. 
In other cases, ballots will come in with numerous different spellings of a candidate’s name, she said. Hilary Francis, the Brattleboro town clerk, told legislators earlier this year about a case where it wasn’t completely clear what member of a family local write-in votes were referring to. 
Under the new law, state and federal write-in candidates must tell either local clerks or the secretary of state about their intent to run by 5 p.m. on the Thursday before an election. When tallying up results, officials will then only count votes for candidates who met the deadline — with some exceptions, including for races in which a write-in candidate gets more votes than anyone whose name is listed on the ballot.
The goal is that officials will only have to count names of people who actually have a technical chance of getting elected to a given office, according to Hibbert. 
The bill also includes several smaller changes to how local clerks operate elections, including allowing for additional time to address issues with a person’s ballot, a process known as “curing.” 
‘Independent’ fundraisers
Another measure in the new law is meant to clarify that certain campaign finance rules apply to individuals who raise and spend money on behalf of a candidate, but who aren’t directly affiliated with that candidate. It wasn’t entirely clear in state law, according to Hibbert, that certain individual fundraisers had to follow as strict of filing guidelines as, for instance, larger political action committees, which are commonly called PACs.
Specifically, the law revises the definition of the term “independent expenditure-only political committee” to clarify that such a “committee” could include as little as one person.
Hibbert said the Secretary of State’s Office asked legislators to clarify the law after seeing Elon Musk, the billionaire and now-spurned adviser to President Donald Trump, hand out $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters in the leadup to an election for a seat on that state’s Supreme Court earlier this year. Musk was attempting to help elect a conservative judge to the court, though the candidate ultimately lost the race. 
The law also lowered, from $1,000 to $500, the threshold at which these “independent expenditure-only” committees will have to report their activities to the state. The same lowered threshold will also apply to political parties and PACs operating in the state.
Hibbert said she thinks that threshold is still high enough to avoid sweeping in people who advocate, on a very small scale, for and against issues in their communities, such as a school budget. But larger local efforts, she said, warrant greater transparency.
“The goals here were just more consistency across the board,” Hibbert said. 
Auditing voter rolls
Earlier this year, the House voted to affirm the victory of Rep. Jonathan Cooper, D-Pownal, in last fall’s contentious election in the Bennington-1 district, which includes the towns of Readsboro, Searsburg, Stamford, Woodford and a part of Pownal.
Roughly 50 people in the district received the wrong ballot in the election, and the race between Cooper and Republican Bruce Busa was decided by fewer than 30 votes, calling into question if the error influenced the result and how that should be handled.
In response to that election, legislators also added a measure into the election bill that requires local officials in places where House or Senate districts split municipal boundaries, such as in Bennington-1, to audit their voter rolls this year.
Local clerks will have to submit summaries of those audits to the Secretary of State’s Office by Nov. 15 — and the office itself must then develop a report on all those findings.
Open meeting law
Another measure in the legislation revises existing state law to “clarify,” according to Hibbert, that annual town meetings are not subject to the slate of requirements laid out in Vermont’s Open Meeting Law. While town meetings are open to all “legal voters” of a given place, Hibbert said, they aren’t — from a legal standpoint — open to the general public, which is where the distinction comes in. 
She said the clarification stemmed from some concern over towns having to provide remote access to town meeting proceedings, including remote voting options. She said that if people had concerns about public access to a town meeting, they could take them to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office or the state’s Human Rights Commission.

Free.,Democratic resolution to block military action in Iran fails to advance in US Senate,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-resolution-block-military-action-iran-fails-advance-us-senate,,"The U.S. Senate rejected Friday, 47-53, a resolution authored by Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine to block American forces from hostility against Iran.Though a shaky ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel has held this week, somewhat diminishing the urgency of the vote, proponents of the resolution made two major arguments during floor debate Friday: Congress should reassert its constitutional role as the only branch of government that can declare war and U.S. policy toward Iran should tilt more toward diplomacy.“We all agree that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon,” Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen said. “But bombing is not the best, most sustainable way of achieving that goal. And nothing, nothing I heard yesterday at the (classified) intelligence briefing changes that assessment. The bombing attack was also a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution, which reserves to the Congress the power to declare war.”The vote was nearly party-line, with Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman the only Democrat to vote against the measure and Rand Paul of Kentucky the only Republican in favor.Supporters argue for congressional roleU.S. forces dropped bombs on three Iranian nuclear enrichment sites June 21 amid that country’s war with Israel.President Donald Trump claimed an unqualified victory, though news reporting of intelligence assessments has shown the result was inconclusive and could have set Iran’s nuclear program back only a matter of months.Military and intelligence officers provided the classified briefing to members of Congress Thursday.Kaine, who has consistently called for presidents to win congressional authorization before taking offensive military action, said the framers of the Constitution deliberately gave the power to Congress.“War is too big an issue to leave in the hands of even a completely careful and deliberative individual,” Kaine said. “The framers didn't want to leave war in the hands of George Washington, for God's sake. They thought Congress should be involved.”Following the vote, Kaine said in a written statement he was upset with the senators who voted no.“I am disappointed that many of my colleagues are not willing to stand up and say Congress needs to be part of a decision as important as whether or not the U.S. should send our nation’s sons and daughters to fight against Iran,” he said.Paul, who has often clashed with his party on executive authority and other issues, made a constitutional argument and criticized the foreign policy that leads to active military engagement.“The American people are sick and tired of sending their children to fight and die in war zones on the other side of the world with no tangible U.S. interest at stake,” he said. “Abdicating our constitutional responsibility by allowing the executive branch to unilaterally introduce U.S. troops into wars is an affront to the Constitution and to the American people.”535 commanders in chiefOpponents of the resolution argued it would needlessly tie the president’s hands in matters of war.The process required of going through Congress to approve military action would be too long to be practical, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham said.“Just think (of) the chaos that would ensue in this country if there were not one commander-in-chief, but 535, and we had to sit down and talk among ourselves and debate as to whether or not we should go forward with the military operation in question,” he said. “That would paralyze this country.”Tennessee Republican Bill Hagerty said the operation was a success and the decision to order it was entirely within Trump’s constitutional power as commander-in-chief. Iran had been hostile to the U.S. and its ally Israel for decades, he said.“President Trump's actions last weekend did not start a war,” Haggerty said. “His actions ended a war, and not a single American life was lost. We should not be here debating how to constrain effective residential leadership, but rather discussing how to recognize effective leadership and supporting it.”Constraining a president’s power undermines the ability to use the element of surprise that is crucial to modern warfare, Hagerty added.The resolution “elevates process over common sense, policy and political optics over operational necessity,” he said.",,,,2025-06-27 20:02:04.565167

Montana’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen was cited this week in Belgrade for driving under the influence of alcohol.
Hedalen, serving in her first term as head of the Office of Public Instruction, has not yet appeared in Belgrade Municipal Court to enter a plea.
Lee Enterprises first reported the citation, a misdemeanor.
In a statement Friday, Hedalen, a Republican, apologized for her poor judgment.
“I apologize and take full responsibility for my lapse in judgement that led to this incident,” Hedalen said in a statement emailed from her chief of staff.
“I want to thank the Belgrade Police for their professionalism and commitment to public safety. As I move forward from this personal issue, it will in no way impact my service to the people of Montana.”
Hedalen was released from the Gallatin County Detention Center on an $885 bond on June 22, the same day she received the citation, according to the court.
A patrol officer outlined the incident that led to her arrest in an affidavit of probable cause.
Late Saturday night, Hedalen was traveling 50 mph in a 35 mph zone, “almost cut off several vehicles” in a turn, and was “slow to react” to the officer’s emergency lights, said the court record.
She had “a dazed expression,” “very slow movements,” and bloodshot eyes, the affidavit said.
“I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle,” the officer said.
Hedalen told the officer she had had “one glass of wine,” said the court record. The affidavit said Hedalen failed both a field sobriety test and a preliminary breath sample.
The legal blood alcohol content limit in Montana is 0.08 percent.
Hedalen subsequently declined to provide an Intoxilyzer breath sample and was transported to the hospital for a blood sample, according to the court record.
Results of the blood test are not yet available, according to the Belgrade Police Department.
However, the Belgrade City Attorney’s Office said results of the test would be considered part of “confidential criminal justice information” until the case concludes.
Hedalen must make an initial appearance in court within 10 days, on or before July 8, according to municipal court.
Former Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen previously pleaded guilty to a traffic violation for “following too closely,” a 2023 incident she described as a “bump with the bumper,” and no contest for illegally passing a school bus in 2022.
Arntzen led OPI for two terms, the last eight years. Hedalen won the office in November 2024 and took her oath in January 2025.
Court records in Hedalen’s case said she had no prior convictions for driving under the influence.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A group of Republican lawmakers, who have opposed carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa, penned a letter to U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill. 
“Repeal 45Q now!” the letter read, naming the section of tax code. 
The budget reconciliation bill, known as the “one big beautiful bill,” has removed or substantially altered a number of clean energy credits for things like wind power or solar projects, but it has retained the 45Q tax credit, which was initiated in 2008 and expanded under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. 
The Senate has not finalized its version of the bill yet, but is aiming for a Fourth of July deadline.

Iowa lawmakers from both the House and the Senate have been opposed to 45Q credits and to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which plans to lay nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline in Iowa alone to transport carbon dioxide captured at ethanol facilities to underground storage in North Dakota. 
Six GOP lawmakers from North Dakota also signed on the letter. A similar letter that circulated earlier this month was headed by lawmakers in South Dakota. 
The opponents in the Iowa-led letter said the federal tax credit “bankrolls private corporations” to “bulldoze our land, intimidate our communities, endanger lives, and bury opportunity.” 
Carbon sequestration pipelines have brought about arguments surrounding private property rights. Summit was granted the right of eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission last year. The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate. 
The bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds June 11, and House lawmakers have submitted a petition to return for a special session to override the veto, but the effort will likely not be picked up by the Senate. 
“For four years, we have fought a grueling legislative battle to defend the constitutional property rights, safety, and economic vitality of our constituents—80–90% of whom reject the 45Q,” the letter read, referencing a survey from the fall conducted by a group opposed to the pipeline. 
In addition to opposing the use of eminent domain, opponents of the CO2 pipeline worry about potential safety issues associated with the project and damage to cropland. 
“Why would we bulldoze our way through some of the best farmland in the world to bury CO2 into formations with unknown consequences and deprive the Corn Belt of adding value and purpose to one third of each bushel of corn in the form of methanol and other fuels?” the letter read. 
Summit has said it will restore cropland impacted by the pipeline to its original condition and holds that it is “going above and beyond” federal standards to ensure safety. 
According to its website, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would have the capacity to put more than 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually into storage. 45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually. 
The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter. 
“This is no state issue —it’s a federal travesty, with 45Q’s unlimited borrowed billions fueling corporate aggression,” the letter read. 
A 2023 report on the tax credit from the Congressional Budget Office estimated by the 2030s the expanded use of carbon sequestration and companies claiming the credits could result in federal revenue loss between $30 billion and “well over” $100 billion. 
The letter from lawmakers said the cost was “staggering.” 
Carbon capture and sequestration would allow the Iowa biofuels industry to enter the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which it says would be hugely beneficial to struggling farmers and the state.
The CBO report also projected that if all of the projected carbon capture and sequestration projects across the country were brought online, it could remove close to 3% of the nation’s annual CO2 emissions.
The letter argues if the industry attempts to reach “net zero” emissions, the cost of these tax credits to the federal government, and taxpayers, would be even higher. 
“Repealing 45Q in (the budget reconciliation bill) would halt this federally funded nightmare, save trillions of additional debt, and empower our farmers and ethanol plants to lead a new renewable fuels revolution,” the letter said. “Our constituents demand it, our farmland deserves it, and our future depends on it.”
Ernst’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.
A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.

Dan Newhouse (R-WA), seen during a July 2019 hearing on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C., was reelected in the 2024 election to a sixth term in the U.S. House.Washington U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse says he won’t back the sweeping tax cut and spending bill his fellow Republicans are trying to push through Congress if it includes controversial provisions to sell off federal public land.
Newhouse and four other Republicans in the U.S. House stated their opposition to the potential land sales in a Thursday letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson.
“If a provision to sell public lands is in the bill that reaches the House floor, we will be forced to vote no,” says the letter, which was also signed by Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Oregon, and Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif.
Republicans hold a narrow 220-212 majority in the House, and their “One Big Beautiful Bill” squeaked through that chamber by just a single vote in May.
Before it did, Republicans scrapped a proposal to make 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah available for sale.
The sweeping budget legislation is now under consideration in the Senate, where Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced a scaled-up version of the land sale proposal earlier this month. It would’ve made millions of acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management property in Washington and other states eligible for sale.
Earlier this week, the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled the language of Lee’s original proposition was out of order. However, Lee has said he wants to press ahead with a narrower version of the plan that would still put thousands of acres of Bureau of Land Management property up for sale in 11 Western states, including Washington. 
Newhouse and the four other Republicans said in their letter to Johnson that they “generally accept changes to the bill that may be made by the Senate.” But they added: “We cannot accept the sale of federal lands that Senator Lee seeks.”
They said efforts by Lee to add a land sale proposal into the bill “would be a grave mistake, unforced error, and poison pill that will cause the bill to fail should it come to the House floor.”
A spokesman for Newhouse’s office said Friday the congressman did not have any comment on the issue beyond what was said in the letter.

With the devastating Los Angeles blazes still fresh in memory, cities across the Bay Area region are developing plans to lower the climate-heating emissions that are fanning the flames.
But a dangerous new bill now threatens this progress. AB 306, while purporting to address the fallout from this year’s fires, could actually increase the risk of future fires and pause local progress to address other climate disasters.
This week the provisions of AB 306 were put on the fast track for approval as state leaders shifted the contents of the bill into a budget trailer bill — a process that will make it eligible for approval by midnight Monday. 
While some narrow exceptions were added, the measure would still ban most local governments from adopting stronger building codes that promote energy efficiency until 2031. This severely limits improvements for six years — even as climate disasters intensify and technology advances — and circumvents local control and the normal legislative process in the state Senate.
We know firsthand how much of a mistake this would be. In San Jose and Palo Alto, we proved that smart building codes are one of our state’s best tools for increasing climate resilience, cutting pollution, lowering energy bills and protecting public health.
In 2019 the San Jose and Palo Alto city councils approved codes that cut development costs by going all-in on electrification, while cutting back on expensive and often unnecessary gas hookups. This — combined with additional incentives for solar panels and electric vehicle chargers in San Jose and for home appliances in Palo Alto — is creating cleaner air and reducing emissions, all without breaking the bank. 
Thousands of Palo Alto and San Jose residents now enjoy lower energy costs and healthier air quality, thanks to their all-electric homes.
Across the state, cities have followed the lead of San Jose and Palo Alto, by crafting building codes that are tailored to each community’s needs. Local challenges, such as sea level rise, housing shortages, or wildfire risks are often best addressed with locally-crafted solutions.
The proposed measure in the budget trailer bill puts this progress at risk. 
Proponents claim it will help fire victims rebuild affordably. The evidence says otherwise. Multiple studies have confirmed that there is “no clear correlation between energy code updates and rising housing prices.”
If anything, pausing code updates would worsen California’s affordability crisis. New energy standards have saved Californians more than $100 billion in utility costs over the past 50 years, and the next update is expected to save another $4.8 billion. 
Cities we represent and others across California deserve to benefit from these proven savings, but now they risk getting stuck with outdated, energy-wasting appliances. 
Energy-efficient homes aren’t just cheaper to live in — they are also cheaper to build. As we saw from our successes in our cities, building with efficient electric appliances can save up to $10,000 per unit by eliminating the need for gas line infrastructure.
The building code pause would also pause this commonsense progress, taking control away from local cities without making housing any more affordable.
Here’s the cruel irony:  this “wildfire recovery” option could make future fires worse. By blocking local clean energy policies that reduce climate-warming pollution and stripping communities of the flexibility to update codes based on advances in technology, the proposed change leaves us more vulnerable to the next disaster. 
Lawmakers should be empowering communities to be agile in response to new technologies and to explore localized solutions that promote efficiency and affordability. Cutting pollution and facilitating housing construction can co-exist.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_39.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 19:03:32.698157

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Immigrant advocates said Friday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling on birthright citizenship is creating alarm for an already fearful immigrant community.
“It’s going to be more chaotic than it is right now, for sure,” said Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Bergen). “Every time I think, ‘Oh, this is the worst it’s going to be,’ it just gets even worse. And I think people really need to wake up to what’s happening right under their nose.” 
The high court’s 6-3 decision is a major win for President Donald Trump and his push to detain and deport millions of immigrants. The decision reins in nationwide injunctions from lower courts that had blocked Trump’s order restricting birthright citizenship, saying universal injunctions likely exceed federal courts’ authority. The court declined to rule on the constitutionality of Trump’s order, which would deny citizenship to babies born to people in the United States on short-term visas or without legal status.
The cases now return to the lower courts that had issued those injunctions, with instructions to ensure that their new orders comport with the high court’s ruling. Twenty-two states, including New Jersey, challenged Trump’s birthright citizenship order.
Officials in New Jersey, where roughly 1 in 4 residents are immigrants, rebuked the Supreme Court decision.
Democratic members of the Legislative Latino Caucus said it “opened the door for a harmful policy that threatens a basic promise” of birthright citizenship. Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Democrat, said people “have a right to be concerned,” but added he is confident attorneys general across the nation will successfully challenge Trump’s order.
“Birthright citizenship is part of the fabric of this nation. We’re going to win on that,” Platkin told reporters Friday. “The Supreme Court very clearly did not say otherwise today, and ultimately, when this is resolved, their rights will be vindicated.” 
In a statement, Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said he has “no doubt that the Trump Administration will see today’s decision as an invitation to continue disregarding the Constitution,” but believes the lower courts will conclude Trump’s order is “blatantly illegal.”
Friday’s ruling left room for relief through the filing of class action lawsuits, and at least two have been filed by immigrant rights groups since the decision was released.
Steven Sacco, an attorney with immigrant rights group American Friends Service Committee, said that until the fight over birthright citizenship is resolved, “it’ll be chaos, and just a great deal of terror and disruption to everyone’s lives.”
“It puts us all in danger,” he added. “It seems the Trump administration is so eager to deport people that the deportation law is the hole through which democracy is draining out of the United States.”










Every time I think, ‘Oh, this is the worst it’s going to be,’ it just gets even worse.


– Assemblywoman Ellen Park


Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, compared Friday’s decision to the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal right to an abortion, known as Dobbs. 
“It caused so much confusion, people were willing to uproot and displace themselves to be able to find sanctuary in those states that had affirmatively passed protections, and New Jersey was quick to act in enshrining some of those protections in our laws,” she said.
Torres added that Friday’s ruling similarly “ripped away” a right that people saw as a fully cemented civil liberty — but the reaction from New Jersey lawmakers has been different.
“I think we’re not seeing the same swiftness toward providing privacy protections for immigrants in the same way,” she said.
While New Jersey can’t outright provide birthright citizenship, she said, lawmakers can pass the Immigrant Trust Act to enshrine protections for people who could be targets of federal immigration authorities. That bill, sponsored by Park, would codify a 2018 state directive barring local law enforcement from assisting in civil immigration enforcement. It would also prohibit officials in public places like hospitals, schools, and libraries from collecting information on residents’ immigration status.
The bill was introduced in October but has yet to receive a legislative hearing, a key step toward passage. Top lawmakers have suggested it would leave the state open to new lawsuits.
Without the bill, Torres noted, hospitals and health care centers can collect immigration status and potentially disclose it to federal agents, particularly if there is no guidance from the state. 
Sacco said the bill would “protect citizens under this regime just as it does non-citizens.”
“The Immigrant Trust Act will prevent state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE in a way that will protect, in this case, citizens from deportation,” he said.

Park, who is an immigrant from South Korea, said she’s “flabbergasted” by Friday’s ruling but has hopes birthright citizenship as it has been defined for 157 years will remain.
She agreed the Immigrant Trust Act would offer more protections for New Jersey families and called for its passage. But she noted the federal government is creating its own rule book — like going after students writing critical opinion pieces in college newspapers and undocumented people without criminal records who have been here for decades.
“Are they then going to take it up a notch? Basically not just wait outside — but maybe even enter homes and enter churches and other places?” she said. “This is going to get crazy.”

Ten years and one day after that ruling, the Flippins, born and raised Denverites, got married at the Denver Elections Division after being together for 14 years. 
“We’ve considered each other wives for quite a long time, so it seemed like an appropriate time to actually sign that certificate,” Melissa said.

The Denver Clerk and Recorder’s office held its first ever Pride Marriage Marathon Friday, allowing couples to get a marriage license and have a ceremony officiated on the same day to kick off Denver Pride weekend. Couples picked up their marriage licenses at Wellington E. Webb Municipal Building and walked over to the elections division office for their ceremonies.
The clerk’s office has consistently held a Marriage Marathon on Valentine’s Day, and Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López said his office was overdue to host a Pride rendition. 
“It’s a celebration, and for me, I take it seriously as much as it’s a celebration, because I know what’s at stake,” López said. “I know what’s at stake in the environment that we’re facing right now, and in a little bit of uncertainty, it’s that much more of a powerful thing to do.”

López said his office initially planned a Pride Marriage Marathon in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic stopped it from starting that summer. He said the day was filled with tears, joy, excitement and giddiness. 
“I feel joyful. It’s an honor to do this, especially for folks in our community,” López said. “We want to honor folks, especially today, honor love, and remind mind folks that love is love. I think there’s probably no other words more powerful than that.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Republican leaders in Congress have rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government and have targeted access to gender-affirming care for transgender people. The Supreme Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority, and concern that the court could reverse the Obergefell decision has grown since it overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion.
Colorado voters in November approved an amendment to remove language — though it was inoperable because of the Obergefell decision — from the Colorado Constitution that banned same-sex marriage. The Colorado Legislature passed a law this year that would remove similar language from state statute.

López got to officiate the wedding for a relative of a friend he went to school with. That was for Sade Kiel and Emily Panyachitch, who had their ceremony under a rainbow balloon arch in the center of the Elections Division. The room went silent as over a dozen of their family members gathered to watch them share wedding vows. 
“We are very fortunate, because a lot of people don’t have this amount of support,” Kiel said about their family. “So I can’t explain in words how I feel. It’s just a beautiful thing. I’m just so happy. I’m ecstatic. I’m just blessed, to be honest.”

Kiel said she was overwhelmed with “all the good emotions that you should have at the end of a wedding ceremony.” The couple, who have been together 12 years, took four days to plan a small reception to celebrate their marriage. 
“We’ve been talking about having a wedding for so very long, but of course, the important thing for us was buying a home,” Kiel said. “So we purchased our first home versus having a wedding, and so seeing this opportunity arise … I was like, would you like to do this? And she was like let’s do it.” 
Panyachitch said she looks forward to celebrating Pride in Denver with Kiel as newlyweds this year. 
“Say it out loud. Don’t be afraid to come out. Don’t be afraid to be yourself,” Panyachitch said. “There will always be an entourage out there for you who is cheering for you.”

James Murphy and Alex Albarenga got engaged in August 2024 and were planning a larger wedding, but they managed to plan a reception for about 50 people to celebrate their marriage after deciding to go to the Pride Marriage Marathon two weeks ago.
“We are ready to get married today. We’ve been together for three and a half years, and we just felt like this is a really good time, especially with things going on today in the world,” Murphy said. “We just want to make sure we can seal our deal and make sure we have our special moment, before it could be ripped away from us.” 
The couple was surrounded by friends during their ceremony, one of whom video called another friend to watch Murphy and Albarenga exchange vows. They planned to celebrate at a rooftop terrace and bar with live music, and will close out their wedding day with a party bus.

Murphy said it “means the world” that he got to marry his best friend the day after the 10-year anniversary of the Obergefell decision and on the first day of Denver Pride weekend.
Cat Pace and Wynona Redman moved to Colorado from Texas a month ago and decided to kick off their time in their new home with a wedding. 
“That kind of sealed the whole deal,” Redman said. Pace added, “House, car, puppies, our daughters are here, our grandbabies are here, it’s exciting.”

Pace said a friend sent her the link about the Pride Marriage Marathon, and the couple thought “why the heck not?” In 2020, Redman’s daughters threw a surprise commitment ceremony for the couple in Denver, so signing their marriage licence in the city felt “full circle.” 
While Pace joked that Colorado is colder than Texas, Redman said “it just feels more like home here.” 
“This is my first pride, to be honest.  I’ve always had to kind of keep it quiet,” Pace said. “So this is pretty cool, just to be able to soak it all in, to see all the friendliness, the cultural support. It’s fantastic.”

Attorneys for Kappa Kappa Gamma are asking for a final ruling to put a two-plus-year legal battle to rest. 
The post Wyoming sorority asks court to dismiss lawsuit over transgender inclusion, again appeared first on WyoFile .","Attorneys for Kappa Kappa Gamma are asking a federal court to end the long-running legal battle over the University of Wyoming sorority’s inclusion of a transgender member. 
“Much has changed in the more than two years since this case was initially filed,” the plaintiffs wrote in a motion to dismiss filed Friday. 
Six members sued the sorority in early 2023 for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Artemis Langford, a transgender woman, by a vote of its members.
U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson dismissed the case in August 2023, ruling that the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members. Months later, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver also dismissed the case. 
That left the sorority sisters — Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar — two choices. They could amend the complaint or ask the lower court for a final judgement. 
Almost a year later, facing a filing deadline, they filed an amended complaint earlier this month that no longer named Langford as a defendant and included a new set of plaintiffs. 
“The matter has bounced between this court and the Tenth Circuit,” Friday’s filing states. “Four of the six named plaintiffs have left the case and a new one has joined. Each of the current and former plaintiffs and the former student defendant who attended the University of Wyoming have graduated.”
And yet, attorneys for the sorority argue, “this remains a case where plaintiffs seek to have a federal court dictate to a private organization how inclusive it can be in defining its own membership.” (Emphasis from the filing.)
In Johnson’s 2023 dismissal of the case, he applied the landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale. 
In 2000, the high court ruled that the scouting organization was exempt from New Jersey state law that bars anti-gay discrimination. The private organization had fired James Dale, an assistant scout master, when it found out he was gay. Overturning a lower court’s decision, the Supreme Court ruled that requiring the Boy Scouts to readmit Dale would violate the private organization’s First Amendment right of expressive association.
“Dale controls today, interestingly with the shoe on the other foot,” Johnson wrote. “Whether excluding gay scoutmasters in Dale or including transgender women in Kappa, this Judge may not invade Kappa’s sacrosanct, associational right to engage in protected speech.”
Attorneys for the sorority pointed back to this in their Friday filings. 
“As was the case when defendants moved to dismiss this case two years ago, plaintiffs have no legal right to have their sorority’s leadership adopt their personal definition of who is and is not a ‘woman,’” the filing states. “And it is not the role of the courts to police the membership decisions of private organizations.” 
The legal defects of the amended complaint extend beyond that, the defendants also argue, pointing to a failure of the plaintiffs to properly identify wrongdoing. Kappa’s attorneys also allege that the sorority sisters failed to serve or attempt to serve all defendants. 
Johnson’s 2023 dismissal was “without prejudice,” meaning it was not a final decision, and effectively left the sorority sisters the option to amend their complaint. 
Kappa’s attorneys are asking the court for a final ruling. 
“Defendants respectfully submit that the time has come for the court to put an end to plaintiffs’ attempts to use this court to advance their preferred social agenda within a private organization of more than 210,000 members,” the filing states. 
The plaintiffs will now have an opportunity to respond before the court makes a decision. 
Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced earlier this month it’s investigating the University of Wyoming for alleged Title IX violations stemming from the sorority’s inclusion of a transgender member.

(Phot courtesy of U.S. Forest Service) Residents of Pine Valley, where the Forsyth Fire swept through last week destroying homes, were able to return to their community on Friday — but the 10,000-plus acre fire continues to burn, and officials say locals should be prepared to evacuate again. 
Meanwhile, fire danger continues to rise across Utah, prompting statewide restrictions and a call from Gov. Spencer Cox to pray for rain. 
This summer is off to a fiery start, with 380 blazes across the state, 275 of them human-caused. The majority of Utah is currently in either severe or moderate drought and an estimated 43,000 acres have burned. 
That includes the 10,600 acres burned by the Forsyth Fire, which as of Friday has destroyed at least 14 structures, most of them homes, in the small Pine Valley community located north of St. George. Although residents were allowed to return home on Friday, the community remains in a “Set” level evacuation order, meaning they should prepare to evacuate again if the situation worsens.

Crews have made progress fighting the lightning-caused fire, which is now about 8% contained. But officials with the U.S. Forest Service say rising temperatures and strong winds continue to pose a threat to the area. 
To that end, the governor, as he has done in past years, called for a day of prayer and fasting for rain on Sunday, June 29. 
“Utah is facing a tough season, and we need both divine help and practical action,” Cox said in a statement on Friday. “I invite every Utahn, whatever your faith or belief system, to join me this Sunday in a unified fast and prayer for rain. And while we look heavenward, let’s do our part here at home — fix leaks, water lawns less and use every drop wisely. Small actions, taken together, can make a big difference for our state.”
The largest fire in the state is the France Canyon Fire, burning in Dixie National Forest outside of Bryce Canyon National Park. As of Friday, the fire was at 32,053 acres and about 15% containment. 
Officials also announced statewide fire restrictions on both state and federal land — that means no fires in spaces outside of approved campgrounds or homesites with running water; no fireworks, shooting exploding targets or metalwork; no operating machinery or equipment (including motorcycles, chainsaws, ATVs, or other small internal combustion engines) without a spark arrestor; and no smoking near vegetation. 
Those restrictions apply to the following regions: 

All state owned land (including state parks, trust lands and wildlife management areas)
All unincorporated private land 
Six Bureau of Land Management districts — the Arizona Strip, Color Country, Canyon Country, Green River, Paria River and West Desert districts
Three U.S. Forest Service regions — Dixie, Fishlake and Manti-La Sal national forests
Eight national parks, monuments and recreation areas — Arches, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands national parks; Cedar Breaks, Hovenweep and Natural Bridges national monuments; and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area 

“Our forests and rangelands at all elevations are drying out quickly, making it easier for wildfires to ignite and spread — especially on windy days,” said Brett Ostler, the state fire management officer with the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands.

In strongly worded dissenting opinions, two of the Iowa justices called the majority’s decision in the case on Friday “frightening” and “profoundly wrong,” warning that it could remove any disincentive for state officials to willfully hold prisoners well beyond their scheduled release dates.
Justice David May, joined by Chief Justice Susan Christensen and Justices Thomas Waterman and Edward Mansfield, upheld a district court judge’s decision to dismiss Eugene Sikora’s claim for damages for being held in prison past his proper release date.
Justice Christopher McDonald, joined by Justices Dana Oxley and Matthew McDermott, filed a dissenting opinion. In addition, Oxley filed a dissenting opinion of her own, in which she was joined by McDonald and McDermott, and McDermott authored a dissenting opinion of his own, in which he was joined by McDonald and Oxley.
In his lawsuit, Sikora had claimed the state had released him from prison five months late due to a mathematical miscalculation. Three years after he was released, Sikora sued the state and the director of the Iowa Department of Corrections for wrongful imprisonment, seeking monetary damages.
A district court judge dismissed the lawsuit, citing the doctrine of sovereign immunity in which the state and its employees are generally considered immune from state-law tort claims for monetary damages arising from wrongful imprisonment.
In upholding that district court decision, Justice May, writing for the majority, stated that no exceptions to the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied to the case and concluded Sikora’s suit could not proceed.
“The district court properly rejected Sikora’s state law claims for money damages,” May wrote. “But this does not mean that our courts are unable to help persons who are wrongfully detained in Iowa prisons. If Sikora had asked our courts for non-monetary relief — like an order to release him from prison — sovereign immunity would not have foreclosed his request.”
May noted there are “pathways for wrongfully convicted prisoners to obtain money damages in state court. One element of Iowa law, he noted, waives sovereign immunity to permit money damages claims by people who are imprisoned because of wrongful convictions – but that law doesn’t apply to Sikora’s case, May wrote, because he pleaded guilty to his crimes.
McDonald says majority is ‘profoundly wrong’

In his dissenting opinion, Justice McDonald noted that America’s foundational principles and common law enabled people injured by government officials to sue those same government officials for monetary damages and other relief.
“This common law regime of rights was codified as fundamental law in the structure and text of the federal and state constitutions, including the Iowa Constitution,” McDonald wrote. “The state now claims that its officials can violate this fundamental law and imprison people with impunity … Not even King George III asserted such power for his officials, and our forefathers attempted to make sure none could assert it here. They understood that tyranny authorized by statute is still tyranny.”
McDonald wrote that the law extending the state’s immunity in cases such as Sikora’s “is illegal and void because the extension of sovereign immunity to these government officials contravenes the structure and text of the state constitution.”
McDonald also characterized the majority’s decision as “profoundly wrong” and an example of “willful ignorance” with regard to its refusal to acknowledge past court decisions. The “special status” the majority conferred upon state officials, McDonald wrote, “does not make sense. What logical distinction would provide state officials immunity superior to federal and local officials?”
Even if the state had “some legitimate interest in limiting the liability of its employees” for their conduct, McDonald added, “its chosen means in this case — the total elimination of any right of recovery for wrongfully imprisoned people — is unduly oppressive and thus constitutionally forbidden.”
McDonald said the state’s claim of sovereign immunity was “nothing more than an assertion that the government and its officials have the unilateral right to alter the state constitution through normal legislation and wrongly imprison people without being held to account. That assertion is odious and repugnant to republican constitutional order.”

Noting that the Iowa state flag says, “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain,” McDonald opined that the court’s majority was rejecting “the very core of liberty at the heart of our state constitutional order” by asserting that wrongful imprisonment at the hands of state officials is lawful. “It should not be celebrated here,” he wrote. “It is absolutism, pure, simple, and naked.”
In his separate dissenting opinion, Justice McDermott called the majority’s decision “both frightening and, as a legal matter, wrong.”
McDermott said “the evidence is overwhelming that during Iowa’s founding era, people could pursue lawsuits for money damages against government officials in both Iowa and federal courts. The majority’s claim to the contrary — that sovereign immunity protects state officials from private causes of action — is fundamentally incompatible with the historical evidence.”
McDermott added that the majority’s dismissal of Sikora’s claim left Sikora “without a remedy despite his having allegedly suffered five months of unlawful confinement. And after today, it is hard to see what disincentive any state prison official would have to unlawfully hold an inmate well beyond his release date.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Iowa-Supreme-Court.jpg,,,2025-06-27 19:03:32.698157

The communications union district has sought to switch over its operations to a new nonprofit while fighting a fierce legal battle against GWI, its current Maine-based operator.

As ECFiber and the company that currently runs its operations continue to spar in court, the communication union district announced that its new service provider has hired its first chief executive officer.  
Gopi Sundaram, a longtime investor in broadband projects, is taking the helm of the Vermont ISP Operating company, or VISPO, a nonprofit created by members of ECFiber’s board. The organization plans to take over ECFiber’s operations next year.
Sundaram currently serves as a managing partner at Radius Capital Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in telecommunications investments. Previously, he was the managing director of the Tetrad McCourt consortium, an investment group that helped oversee the deployment of Ireland’s National Broadband Plan. 
“We were very happy to have Gopi join the VISPO board initially, and thrilled when he told us he’d be willing to become our CEO,” said VISPO board chair Alessandro Iuppa in a Thursday press release. “His expertise and deep experience gives VISPO the requisite leadership to manage and operate ECFiber.”

ECFiber is Vermont’s oldest communications union district — a type of municipal entity created by lawmakers in 2015 to support the rollout of high speed internet access in underserved parts of the state. (Founded in 2008 as an alliance of towns, ECFiber preceded, and served as a model for, other communications union districts in the state.) The district serves slightly fewer than 10,000 customers across 31 Vermont member towns and owns roughly 1,750 miles of fiber optic cable lines, according to its 2024 annual report. 
Members of ECFiber’s governing board moved to take on VISPO as its new service provider in April as a simmering legal spat between the district and its current operating company, the Maine-based Biddeford Internet Corp (also known as Great Works Internet, or GWI) began to reach a boiling point. 
GWI first took over operations for ECFiber in 2022, after a sequence of scandals led the district’s previous service provider ValleyNet, a nonprofit, to step back and ultimately dissolve in April, according to a business filing with the Vermont Secretary of State. 
GWI also runs operations for two more of Vermont’s nine communications union districts — DVFiber and Northwest Fiberworx.
But in February, ECFiber accused GWI of starting to reorganize its operations in a way that would detract from the service provided to the district. GWI has meanwhile argued that VISPO was created on false pretenses, and that the communications district has violated their contract in attempting to abruptly transition between service providers.
In March, GWI launched a lawsuit against ECFiber’s governing board chair F.X. Flinn, claiming that the creation of VISPO was a maneuver orchestrated by Flinn “to literally poach GWI’s business and its opportunity with ECFiber for himself.”

Flinn, who was initially a founding director of the nonprofit operating company but has since stepped down, has strenuously denied the claims, arguing in court filings and in interviews that the lawsuit is a “SLAPP suit,” or a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, designed to intimidate ECFiber and complicate its transition to VISPO.  
And in a flurry of legal filings made in recent months, the case has begun to escalate as GWI and ECFiber have accused one another of breaching their agreement. 
In an amended complaint filed in mid-May, GWI broadened the scope of its initial lawsuit against Flinn by naming ECFiber itself as a codefendant. It also accused the communication union district of violating its contract, among other allegations. 
ECFiber, meanwhile, has countersued, alleging that GWI has refused to cooperate as the district has attempted to begin shifting its operations to VISPO. 
In May, ECFiber introduced a “transition policy” under which GWI would allow VISPO to gradually learn and take on all operating capabilities, from billing and bookkeeping to marketing and network management. Claiming that GWI has thus far refused to comply with the policy, ECFiber last week asked the court for a preliminary injunction requiring the company to cooperate, saying that the district would otherwise suffer “irreparable harm.”
In a written statement to VTDigger, however, GWI CEO Karem Durdag said that the contract between the two entities “does not allow ECFiber to unilaterally impose such obligations” on GWI and that the company would say as much in court.
“ECFiber is attempting to force GWI to train, equip, and effectively subsidize a start-up competitor, without our consent, without compensation, and on an unrealistic timeline,” Durdag said. “That demand is not only unjust and unprecedented, it is deeply irresponsible. It would require pulling skilled GWI employees from other Vermont CUDs and would compromise the very viability of our operations.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)The permitting and approval process to build new homes and apartment units in Idaho is too time consuming, which contributes to a lack of affordable housing, a legislative committee studying housing issues in the Gem State heard Friday. 
New Idaho legislative committee aims to identify barriers – and solutions – to housing issues

The delays affect the availability of housing and ultimately add to the housing costs the eventual owners or renters will pay, homebuilders and other speakers told the Idaho Legislature’s Land Use and Housing Study Committee.
The committee, which includes state legislators, building officials, architects, planners and city and county elected officials, is studying the barriers and solutions to Idaho’s affordable housing challenges. Friday was its second meeting, which was held at the College of Eastern Idaho in Idaho Falls.
During Friday’s meeting, Valley County Commissioner Sherry Maupin said the so-called “not in my backyard,” or “NIMBY” opposition to housing and development also adds to the state’s inability to build more homes. 
“This has been going on since the ‘60s, and that is why that there has been a decrease in building. (It’s) because people are coming in in droves and saying, ‘not in my backyard,’” Maupin said. “So that is driving a lot more litigation. We’ve had an increase in litigation in Valley County, where there’s a lot of appeals that we’ve never had appeals of before. So it is slowing down the process.”

Sen. Ali Rabe, D-Boise, pushed for the formation of an interim committee to study housing barriers and solutions during the recent 2025 legislative session. Rabe modeled Idaho’s committee after a Montana committee, and she hopes it will come up with bipartisan solutions for housing availability and affordability.
The committee will be able to make recommendations to the Idaho Legislature during the 2026 legislative session. 
The Idaho Legislature’s Land Use and Housing Study Committee has two other meetings scheduled. The interim committee plans to meet Aug. 14 in Sandpoint and Sept. 26 in Boise. 
Friday’s meeting was streamed live online through the Idaho in Session service, which is a partnership between Idaho Public Television, the Idaho Legislature and the Idaho Legislative Services Office.

(Getty Images)Parties on both sides of a federal lawsuit over Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender youth must file supplemental briefs in light of last week’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Tennessee’s similar ban, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Friday.
A federal judge blocked Arkansas’ Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act of 2021 before it could go into effect, in response to a lawsuit filed by four families of transgender minors represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas. The judge permanently enjoined the law on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds in June 2023, and the state appealed the ruling.

U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors


The appeals court heard oral arguments in the case last year and has yet to issue a ruling. On Friday, the court ordered the plaintiffs and defendants to file briefs “addressing only the equal protection claim in light of United States v. Skrmetti,” the Tennessee case.
The SAFE Act “prohibits medical care on the basis of sex,” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, U.S. District Judge James Moody wrote in his June 2023 ruling. The law prohibited physicians from providing “gender transition” treatments like hormones, puberty blockers and surgeries to those under age 18.
Tennessee’s similar law was blocked in federal district court but overturned by an appeals court and upheld 6-3 by the U.S. Supreme Court, a decision that did not lift the injunction on Arkansas’ law. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Tennessee’s law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.
Roberts wrote that the court would leave policy decisions about transgender health care up to “the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.” State officials in both Tennessee and Arkansas have claimed transgender health care for minors is rooted in activism and experimentation rather than evidence-based science.
However, “the State’s experts offered no evidence-based treatment alternatives” to prescribing hormones and puberty blockers for transgender youth, Moody wrote in his ruling. Without evidence to support the state’s claims, the law also violated the right to due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the parents of transgender children, he wrote.

The appeals court gave the parties in the lawsuit until July 11 to file their briefs.
Three of the four transgender minor plaintiffs — Dylan Brandt of Greenwood, Sabrina Jennen of Fayetteville and Parker Saxton of Vilonia — are now at least 18 years old. The fourth, Brooke Dennis of Bentonville, is 13 years old.
One parent of each child shared their experiences with their children’s gender transitions during the case’s eight-day trial in 2022, the nation’s first trial over a law like the SAFE Act. Brandt, then 17, was the only minor to take the witness stand.
The other two plaintiffs were Dr. Michele Hutchison and Dr. Kathryn Stambough, physicians who have treated transgender minors in Arkansas.
The defendants are Attorney General Tim Griffin and the Arkansas State Medical Board.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

As he drove down the street, they called his name and begged him to play football. His daughter, Reena, was the weight on her father’s ankles when he did sit-ups. They watched “Popeye” together. 
“He would go to a record player and put on a 33 with Chubby Checker, and he would twist the night away,” Reena Evers-Everette recalled.
Those were just a few of the details shared at the Daddys’ Daughters Panel on Thursday night, an event where daughters of men killed while at tthe center of the civil rights movement shared intimate stories about life with their fathers.
Panelists included Reena Evers-Everette, daughter of Mississippi NAACP Field Secretary Medgar Evers, Bettie Dahmer, daughter of Vernon Dahmer, and Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
Joy Reid, political commentator and former MSNBC national correspondent, moderated the panel, one of a series of events honoring the legacy of Medgar Evers.
Reid also joined writer and professor W. Ralph Eubanks on Friday to discuss ‘The Power of the Word.’” Moderated by Ebony Lamumba, the panel explored the role of storytelling in the fight for racial justice.
All the “daughters” panelists shared memories about their fathers.

Vernon Dahmer, who was murdered after offering to pay poll taxes for African Americans in Forrest County so they could vote, played make believe with her with her tea set and taught her how to drive a standard shift truck, Bettie Dahmer said. 
His house was a refuge for the local community. He hosted Fourth of July picnics and allowed Boy Scout troops to camp on his land.
“It was safe,” Bettie Dahmer said. “We had other places where kids could come and be safe.”
That was until Jan. 10, 1966, when Klansmen attacked their home near Hattiesburg while the family slept, firing guns into the home. Vernon Dahmer grabbed his shotgun and fired back, enabling his family to escape out a back window, but flames from the blaze seared his lungs. He died a day later. 
Evers-Everette, whose father was shot in the back in the driveway of their Jackson home on June 12, 1962, says she was her father’s “princess.”

“Love is what resonates throughout my life, because that’s what I grew up with and that’s what my father instilled in us,” she said.
The panelists spent time honoring their mothers. Years after her father was murdered for fighting for voting rights, Bettie Dahmer’s mother Ellie would serve as an election commissioner. 
Evers-Everette credits her mother, Myrlie Evers, with the phrase “You can kill a man, but you can’t kill an idea.” 
Myrlie Evers later served as chairman of the NAACP.

Kerry Kennedy said her father, who as U.S. attorney general enforced civil rights legislation and as a senator advocated for voting rights and against discrimination, ran towards fires started during a civil rights protest instead of watching them on TV. He was assassinated after winning the California Democratic primary for president in 1968. Kerry Kennedy argued that Americans should adopt the stance her father had about taking action.
“We need our country today to run into the flames,” said Kerry Kennedy. “Because our country is on fire.”
The daughters talked about how to continue the legacies of their fathers and mothers.
“I hope each and every one of you understands the importance of the vote. It’s not just going and doing a checkmark. It’s a checkmark for your life,” Evers-Everette said. 
She hoped attendees would “remember that.”
“If you honor them, and you honor our fathers and our mothers — do something about it,” she said.

At the Panel of the Word, Reid, who wrote a biography of Medgar and Myrlie Evers, also spoke on the Pentagon’s proposal to’ rename the Navy cargo ship USNS Medgar Evers and the renaming of the oiler USNS Harvey Milk as the USNS Oscar Peterson.
Reid described history as “a series of stories of people who, through their resilience, survived enslavement, survived Jim Crow, survived hate, survived fear, and survived the abandonment of the federal government of our communities, and their stories collectively are what make history.” 
“And so, when you don’t know the impact of those stories, it’s easy to do a thing like strip Harvey Milk’s name off of a Navy battleship…threaten to do the same to USNS Medgar Evers,” she said.

Ralph Eubanks, author and visiting professor at the University of Mississippi
Referring to scholar Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s concept of “the single story,” Eubanks warned about anti-Diversity, Equity and Inclusion backlash in classrooms. “What is being imposed on us is — trying to impose on us — is a single story, and there is a real danger in that,” he said.
“I mean, think about what is happening with the DEI legislation in this state…Oxford, Mississippi, has 45 working writers, and…probably half of their work, including my own, could be banned,” he said.
Eubanks referred to the state’s new anti-DEI law, which prohibits public schools and state colleges and universities from a variety of practices related to DEI. This includes engaging in “divisive concepts.”  The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and several other civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit challenging the law. A federal judge is considering issuing a restraining order to block the law from going into effect.
Answering an audience member’s question, Reid and Eubanks both spoke on how Mississippi and the South are precursors to current national policies.
“So what’s happened is these Southern states have developed a version of what we’re now facing nationally, and so the shock is north of the Mason-Dixon line,” said Reid.
“We’re all living in Mississippi now,” said Eubanks. “Everybody in this county has at least one foot in Mississippi whether they want to admit it or not.”

A former employee is suing The Greenwood School in Putney for allegedly permitting sexual harassment and discrimination and breaching an implied contract. 
The trial date has been set for March 1, 2026.
A former administrative assistant for The Greenwood School alleged that the school’s administration failed to adequately address recurrent sexual harassment that she experienced from a student, according to the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court of Vermont by attorney Theodore Kramer in June 2024. 
The employee resigned from her post at The Greenwood School — a specialized boarding and day school, serving neurodivergent students from grades 6 to 12 — in January 2024 due to the “sexually hostile environment.”
The complaint describes a student repeatedly “inappropriately touching” the former employee as well as making comments, facial expressions and engaging in “other acts of a sexual nature” directed at the former employee between May and November 2023. 
When the former employee reported the first incident, in which the student pulled her toward him and touched her buttocks, the dean of students said that the student had “‘mommy issues’ and was looking for a connection,” the complaint states. 
The complaint goes on to describe several times when the student touched her breasts, buttocks and other parts of her body despite the former employee asking the student to stop, and after she reported the instances to the administration. 
The former assistant “specifically recalls the head of school telling her to ‘get over it’ and ‘nothing is ever solved by worrying about what has already happened’” after she wrote a letter to the administration about her concerns in November 2023, according to the complaint. 
The administration and faculty at the Greenwood School were allegedly aware that the student had a pattern of “inappropriately touching faculty members, students and parents of students,” according to the complaint.
The student was barred from the administrative building by the head of the middle school in September 2023 after the student engaged in “continued sexual assaults and harassment,” the complaint states. 
The former employee continued to bring her concerns to administrators after harassment occurred, but the school “took no action to investigate or correct the hostile work environment,” the complaint states. 
The lawsuit argues that the alleged hostile work environment interfered with the former employee’s ability to execute her work duties, negatively impacted her mental and physical wellbeing and led to her resignation. 
The complaint also asserts the school breached an implied contract established in the school handbook by “failing to uphold policies and procedures” and not safeguarding the former administrative assistant from the “many examples of harassment” that occured during her employment. 
The former employee is seeking redress in the form of monetary compensation and attorneys fees as well as any “further relief the Court deems proper” during the trial scheduled for next year. The Greenwood School Head of School did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The attorney for the former employee declined to comment while the case is pending in court.

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Attorney General’s Office requested an execution date on Friday for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward, the Spencer County man convicted in 2007 for the rape and murder of 15‑year‑old Stacy Payne. 
A date has not yet been set. A decision on the state’s motion is up to the Indiana Supreme Court.
“We are stunned that they have moved for a date given the very public statements of the governor that the cost is something that should be explored and that this is something the governor wanted the legislature to look at,” defense counsel Larry Komp said in a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
“Given the budget shortfalls, citizens deserve an explanation as to why Indiana spent over a million dollars for controlled substances, from some undisclosed source that is reaping a huge financial windfall at the expense of Indiana citizens,” he continued. “This is especially true given the public descriptions that the drugs did not work how they should have in Mr. Ritchie’s execution.”
Ward, now 52, was originally convicted and sentenced to death in 2002, but the state’s high court justices overturned the verdict due to “prejudicial pre-trial publicity,” according to legal documents. 
Story continues below.
Verified Motion to Set Execution Date (1)
 
The case was sent back to the lower court, where Ward later pleaded guilty and a second jury again sentenced him to death in 2007. 
The Indiana Supreme Court previously set Ward’s execution for December 11, 2012, but that date was automatically stayed due to ongoing federal appeals. No new execution date was set while those legal challenges remained unresolved in the courts.
Ward has since exhausted all state and federal appeals.
Court records indicate Ward attacked Payne after she answered the door of her Dale, Indiana, home shortly after noon on July 11, 2001. Her younger sister heard screams and called 911. Police arrived within minutes and found Ward standing in the doorway of the home, holding a knife. He was arrested at the scene. 
Payne later died from severe injuries, including stab wounds and disembowelment.
Payne was an honor roll student who worked at Jenk’s Pizza, according to her obituary. She was a cheerleader and won awards for public speaking.
Ward’s execution, if approved, would be the third in Indiana since December 2024, following a 15‑year hiatus. Joseph Corcoran was executed by lethal injection in December under former Gov. Eric Holcomb, and Benjamin Ritchie followed in May 2025 under new Gov. Mike Braun. Both executions used a single‐drug protocol of pentobarbital.
Since executions resumed, debates have increased over the high cost and uncertain supply of the drug. 
Braun clarifies Indiana acquisition of execution drugs; reveals more than $1M spent

Reporting by the Capital Chronicle revealed this week the state spending has so far exceeded $1 million for four doses of pentobarbital: half were used and the other half expired. 
The drugs were purchased in two transactions — one under Holcomb and one under Braun.
In total, $1.175 million was spent, Braun said. But two doses — worth $600,000 — expired without use because “they had been on the shelf too long.” Braun said earlier this month that the drug has a 90-day shelf life.
Braun emphasized earlier this week that neither of the doses used by the Indiana Department of Correction in December and May were expired when administered to inmates.
It’s not clear when exactly the state acquired the doses or from where they were purchased. Indiana Code protects the identity of the seller from public scrutiny. State officials had previously declined to provide details about how much pentobarbital was purchased, and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
Braun, a Republican in his first year as governor, has repeatedly said the question of whether Indiana should continue to carry out executions is one that lawmakers should weigh in the months ahead. 
“There are legislators that wonder if it’s still relevant,” he said earlier this month. “I’m going to listen to them, the courts, and the broader discussion in general.”
The governor’s office did not immediately reply to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about the execution date request for Ward.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Iowans prepare to celebrate the 4th of July, a new state law going into effect Tuesday will loosen restrictions on setting off fireworks on July 3 and 4 in some communities.
Senate File 303 was signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May. The law, which takes effect July 1, prevents county boards of supervisors and city councils from banning and limiting the use of consumer fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31 that are more restrictive than state regulations.
Iowa local governments have the ability to set regulations on fireworks in their jurisdictions. Iowa communities like Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City and Dubuque ban the use of consumer fireworks within city limits. Others, like Waterloo, Ankeny and Davenport, have restrictions on fireworks being set off outside of certain dates — typically for Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve celebrations.
The Des Moines City Council — as well as several other local government bodies — have made changes, or are in the process of aligning their local ordinances with the new state law, which requires all local jurisdictions to suspend limits on consumer fireworks for celebrations on these three days. However, it still allows local governments to keep in place bans and limits on fireworks for other times of the year, in addition to requiring Iowans to still follow other regulations on fireworks use existing in state code.
Iowa law limits the legal use of all fireworks to be between June 1 through July 8 and Dec. 10 through Jan. 3 of each year. During these timeframes, consumer fireworks can only be set off between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. each day. Fireworks are allowed to be set off until 11 p.m. on July 4 and the weekends before and after the Fourth of July, and can be set off from 9 a.m. Dec. 31 until 12:30 a.m. Jan. 1.
State code also contains other regulations on fireworks, including a ban on the sale of fireworks to people under age 18 and a prohibition on individuals and organizations setting off “display” fireworks — bigger fireworks often used in professional shows — without permission from their local government. Setting off fireworks in a public park or other city property is also still banned without local approval, as state law bans the use of consumer fireworks outside of a person’s own property or that of someone who has consented to fireworks being used at their property.
The city of Des Moines issued a news release Wednesday warning Iowans that while the state law has changed, fireworks can still not be set off at Des Moines parks or on streets and sidewalks. The news release said in 2024, a third of the city’s 77 parks reported damage or needed cleanup because of unlawful fireworks use, with some parks needing to be shut down to address damages.
“We ask that our residents use fireworks during the permitted times and in the permitted locations respectfully this year,” Des Moines Mayor Connie Boesen said in the release. “That means keeping fireworks to private property and especially out of our Parks to preserve those spaces for our community to use.”
When the law was moving through the Iowa Legislature earlier this year, Democrats speaking on behalf of local governments and law enforcement criticized the measure, saying the areas that had banned consumer fireworks because of the public safety hazards caused by fireworks. But Republicans, including Rep. Bill Gustoff, R-Des Moines, floor manager for the measure in the House, said the change was needed to allow Iowans to fully celebrate the Fourth of July without fear of breaking local laws.
Gustoff said allowing these celebrations was especially important this year in light of President Donald Trump’s plan to launch celebrations in Iowa leading up to the nation’s 250th anniversary July 4, 2026.

Those who live by the proposed site “will be directly impacted by its noise and air pollutants, and will suffer traffic safety impacts and congestion impacts,” said Jim Dumont, a Bristol-based attorney representing Essex residents.

ESSEX JUNCTION — The town’s Development Review Board has asked Amazon to provide traffic assessments of three comparable sites after residents took issue Thursday with the traffic study filed for a proposal to build a 107,000-square-foot distribution facility in Essex’s verdant Saxon Hill.
The site plan, dubbed Project Moose by developers, calls for building the facility and 482 parking spaces at 637 Kimo Drive in an area zoned Preservation District-Industrial (RPD-I), and seeks a waiver for the required 50-foot buffer between the property and the street. If the plan passes, it would be the first Amazon facility in Vermont.
The board on Thursday discussed a traffic impact study submitted by Langan Engineering and a peer review of it by Stantec commissioned by the town.
“Through our conversations, we find that one of the most important and vital pieces to us is really the greater detail about the traffic studies,” board chair Ian Carroll said at 10:07 p.m., after a two-hour private session in the middle of the 6:30 p.m. public hearing on the project proposed by Scannell Properties.

The commercial real estate development company headquartered in Indianapolis has spearheaded warehouse and distribution facilities for Amazon in several states.
“We’d like some post-monitoring assessments of three identified comparable sites, both comparable in size to the current proposal as well as to population,” Carroll said.
Jonathan Greeley, economic development lead for Amazon in New England, pushed back on the request. He said they have “more than accurately overestimated what our traffic impact is going to be” for the proposed project, and that it wasn’t just a study “taken off a shelf.”
“It’s in light of our own self interest that if we’re putting forth traffic counts and putting forth projections, and if we know we’re going to be monitored, that we’re accurately doing so, and so I just want to make sure the board understands we didn’t just make some stuff up,” he said.
Daniel Clarey, senior traffic engineer at Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, further clarified that the overall traffic study was approved by the town, the Vermont Agency of Transportation and the town-appointed consultant Stantec.
Slated as a distribution site, the project would bring “even traffic” with vehicles dropping off packages, loading and leaving quickly, he said.
Besides daytime van trips by workers, the proposal estimates one or two tractor trailers per hour between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., arriving possibly from Massachusetts and Connecticut. Workers at the proposed facility would sort and load packages into Amazon-branded vans to be delivered to homes and businesses within roughly 70 miles.
While Amazon responded Wednesday to the Stantec review of the traffic study, the town has not yet had a chance to examine the letter, said Carroll, who called for a continuance before a decision is made.

Earlier in the evening, resident Duane Millar Barlow said he had contacted several engineering firms to conduct a review he was willing to pay for but found they were reluctant to challenge a peer company’s work.
He submitted a letter disputing the town-commissioned Stantec assessment. 
“Though written in a diplomatic tone, it is a thorough discrediting of the Langan statement’s central conclusion: that the project’s traffic impacts are acceptable and that no further study is warranted.”
Others took issue with a study looking at potential scenarios and said Amazon needs to come back with a study that looks at the actual traffic impacts at similar facilities.
Linda and Tom Merchant, truck drivers and neighbors near Sand Hill Road, said the plan isn’t realistic, especially when accounting for the weather, traffic, accidents and inspections.
Process “unfair”
The third continued hearing drew resident criticism of the plan to clear almost 23 acres of woodland and add construction and truck traffic in an area that is currently forested and near a residential neighborhood.

More than 70 attended the meeting Thursday night with an additional 58 joining remotely, according to town officials.
Emotions ran high from the start of the four-hour long meeting as the chair of the volunteer seven-member board administered an oath calling for civility and limited comments to two minutes.
Speakers cited health and environmental concerns and highlighted Amazon’s record of hazardous and low-paying working conditions in continued opposition to the proposed project.
Those who live by the proposed site “will be directly impacted by its noise and air pollutants, and will suffer traffic safety impacts and congestion impacts,” said Jim Dumont, a Bristol-based attorney representing 23 Essex residents and a newly formed nonprofit called ACRES, an acronym for Alliance of Concerned Residents Envisioning Solutions.
Residents also pointed to the fire department’s March recommendation that the project be required to complete the road connecting the end of Kimo Drive to Thomson Drive. Without it traffic will be forced to one choke point, causing “substantial risk for crashes in winter”  and increased traffic on Saxon Hill Road.
Residents were particularly upset when the board cut short public comment around 8 p.m. to go into a private deliberative session — but not an executive session — that ran two hours.
“It’s a kangaroo court,” Dumont called out as members left the room.

“I’ve seen enough stuff here that undermines my confidence in this town’s governance, in particular over Saxon Hill,” said Bruce Post, a former selectboard member.
As residents and the consultants waited late into the evening for the board to resume, the owners of Phoenix Books, which has stores in Essex and Burlington, provided pizza and seltzer.
Many said they were upset they haven’t been given the same courtesy of time and information as the developers. 
The applicants had known about the meeting since June 10, but the town didn’t post the agenda until one hour after the window for submitting written testimony had passed last Friday, Barlow said.
“The process has been unfair,” he said. “So by the time we knew that this meeting was happening, we couldn’t even submit a letter.”
The public has until 9 a.m. the Friday before a scheduled meeting to provide any written comment, according to Katherine Sonnick, the town’s community development director. The agenda and packet are published around midday Friday, after which no new information can be provided to the board.
The continued public hearing — possibly July 17 — will be confirmed by Monday, Sonnick wrote in an email Friday.

Although the area was rezoned industrial 50 years ago, the 22.94-acre lot off Thompson Drive eyed for the project in Saxon Hill is largely undeveloped, consisting mostly of woodlands and meadows where Vermonters bike and hike, and has historically been mined for sand and used as a tree farm, Scanell’s memo, dated Jan. 30, states.
The lot was established in March after the Development Review Board approved a five-lot subdivision as Phase 2 of the Saxon Hill Industrial Park.
As public opposition to the Amazon facility gathers steam in Essex, Ken Signorello, the chair of the town’s conservation and trails committee, has written a protest song. “With buffers cleared, paradise gets lost to make a parking lot for Amazon town,” he sings, strumming a guitar in the woods of Saxon Hills.

(Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)The ACLU of Idaho on Thursday sued Idaho government officials over a new state law that will prevent unauthorized immigrants from accessing publicly funded assistance.
The new law, approved by the Idaho Legislature this year through House Bill 135, takes effect on Tuesday. It will cut the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. 
ACLU’s lawsuit in federal court seeks to stop Idaho from applying the expanded immigration status check requirement for HIV treatment, alleging the new state law is unconstitutional by violating equal protection, conflicts with federal laws and even denies federal funds to people eligible under federal law.
The lawsuit requests temporary judicial blocks — saying without the care, patients could die.
“Nobody benefits from barring access to life-saving HIV medication,” Dr. Abby Davids, an Idaho doctor who is part of the lawsuit and works at Full Circle Health, said in a statement. “Both for individual patients and for the health of our community as a whole, all people living with HIV need to be able to access consistent care and treatment. Infections like HIV do not infect people based on their immigration status, and treatment should not be limited by legal status, either.”

 Lawsuit filed against Idaho Health and Welfare, attorney general, other officials

Joined by the National Immigration Law Center, and the private law firms Nixon Peabody LLP and Ramirez-Smith Law, ACLU is representing five immigrants and a doctor in Idaho. The lawsuit seeks class-action status to protect all people who are and could receive treatment through the federally funded programs.
ACLU’s lawsuit is against Idaho health officials, including Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams, along with Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador.
“We are still reviewing the lawsuit and will respond in court after we have had a chance to fully review the complaint and other documents filed,” Idaho Attorney General Office spokesperson Damon Sidur told the Idaho Capital Sun on Friday.
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment, saying the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
In a news conference Friday, ACLU of Idaho Legal Director Paul Carlos Southwick called the lawsuit a start. But he said the group learned about, and plans to sue over, another program that Health and Welfare plans to apply the new immigration check law to — the food assistance program for Women, Infants and Children, called WIC.
“We’ve essentially been having to pull this info from (the health department)” and service providers, Southwick said.
 Idaho health department hasn’t said what immigration statuses will be approved, lawsuit alleges

For people who apply for public assistance benefits in Idaho, state agencies are largely required to verify lawful presence. 
But the new law will remove some exceptions for certain services, requiring state agencies to verify someone’s immigration status for access to health assistance for immunizations, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children. 
Emergency services will remain exempt from the immigration status verification requirement under the new law.

The lawsuit alleges the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare has not responded to the suing doctor’s questions about what immigration statuses would be considered “lawfully present.”
One of the immigrants suing Idaho officials, identified only as K.P. in the lawsuit, fears that her employment authorization document and pending asylum application “are not sufficient to satisfy the immigration status verification requirements” under the bill. 
Because of treatment through Full Circle Health, her HIV is undetectable — and she won’t transit the virus to people who don’t have it, the lawsuit says. When she was pregnant, her medication prevented her from transmitting HIV to her daughter, the lawsuit says. 
Her next refill is scheduled for July 8 — a week after the bill takes effect. 
Southwick, with ACLU of Idaho, said in a statement the new law is the second unconstitutional Idaho bill the group has sued over this year. A federal judge swiftly blocked an Idaho immigration enforcement law soon after it took effect — in response to an ACLU of Idaho lawsuit. 
The public benefits bill “is designed to dehumanize our immigrant neighbors by denying them the basic necessities of life — medicine, food, and shelter. It subverts constitutional rights and interferes with federal regulation of immigration,” Southwick said. “… It is part of the state’s campaign to displace immigrant residents, which will separate families and inflict lasting trauma. The state’s actions are legally indefensible and morally wrong.”

“On behalf of my children and myself, I want to express our deepest sympathies to the Hortman and Hoffman families. Our condolences are with all who are grieving during this unimaginably difficult time, and we are praying daily for them,” Jenny Boelter wrote.
Authorities found lists written by Vance Boelter with the names and addresses of Democratic public officials, suggesting the attack was politically motivated. Boelter is alleged to have impersonated a police officer, visiting the homes of Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope and Rep. Kristin Bahner in Maple Grove in addition to the Hortmans and Hoffmans. Rest and Bahner were not harmed.
Vance Boelter texted his wife and other family members in the early hours of June 14, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.”
Jenny Boelter wrote that she and her family were “absolutely shocked, heartbroken and completely blindsided” by the attack and that it was “a betrayal of everything we hold true as tenets of our Christian faith.”
The statement says that Jenny Boelter received a call from law enforcement on June 14 and met with agents at a gas station. She said she answered questions, provided requested items and cooperated with searches.
“From the moment we were first contacted by law enforcement, we have fully cooperated with investigators and responded to their every request…We thank law enforcement for apprehending Vance and protecting others from further harm,” the statement said.
Vance Boelter was arrested the day after the assassination and has been charged with murder by both Hennepin County and federal prosecutors.
Jenny Boelter has retained legal representation from Halberg Criminal Defense, according to the statement. The law firm’s website says that it has taken on “many of the ‘high-profile’ cases in Minnesota.”

Also this week, Iowa Democrats also criticized tax credit cuts during “worst” agricultural trade deficit, Sen. Joni Ernst played “Washington-opoly” with “underutilized” federal properties, and Iowa’s delegation introduced many new bills.
The Supreme Court voted 6-3 Friday to narrow the scope of three universal injunctions passed by federal courts in Massachusetts, Washington and Maryland. These three courts passed injunctions halting the enforcement of Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S.
The decision does not address the constitutionality of ending birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants or children of parents with a temporary visa. The opinion also determined that Trump’s executive order can’t be put into effect for at least 30 days from Friday, providing time for legal challenges.
Here’s how Iowa lawmakers responded:
“Today’s decision is a significant step towards addressing the bipartisan problem of universal injunctions. I’m heartened to hear a supermajority of the Supreme Court echo what I’ve said repeatedly: judges’ constitutional authority is limited to deciding cases and controversies,” Sen. Chuck Grassley stated in a press release.  
“It’s a bad day to be an activist judge, but a great day for the American people,” said Rep. Ashley Hinson on X. “The Supreme Court correctly ruled that activist judges should not be able to unilaterally dictate national policy and stand in the way of the Trump agenda that over 70 million people voted for, including ending birthright citizenship. The days of illegal immigrants abusing birthright citizenship are numbered thanks to President Trump’s leadership.”
“I applaud the Supreme Court’s ruling to curb nationwide injunctions,” said Rep. Randy Feenstra in a post on X. “This decision will rein in the power of district court judges and restore the voice of the people. Americans elected President Trump and want to see his America First policies implemented and upheld.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion stating that: “The majority ignores entirely whether the President’s executive order is constitutional, instead focusing only on the question whether federal courts have the equitable authority to issue universal injunctions. Yet the order’s patent unlawfulness reveals the gravity of the majority’s error and underscores why equity supports universal injunctions as appropriate remedies in this kind of case.”
Iowa Democrats criticize tax credit cuts during ‘worst’ agricultural trade deficit
The Iowa Democratic Party, in a press release Wednesday, criticized the clean energy tax cuts outlined in the “big, beautiful” budget bill. Without clean energy tax credits, Iowa’s economy will take an additional hit at a vulnerable time, the party argues.
The release cites a study by Farm Bureau indicating U.S. agricultural trade debt for January to April 2025 clocked in at $19.7 billion, “the largest ever recorded for the first four months of a year.” Currently, $238 million in economic activity is “under threat” by clean energy tax credit cuts outlined in the Republican budget bill, according to the study. 
The release includes a survey from Wallethub,  which ranked Iowa’s state economy in last place for 2025. “This news could not have come at a worse time,” the Democrats’ release states.
“It’s time for Iowa’s representatives in Congress to stand up to Donald Trump, end his disastrous trade policies, and get to work on a new farm bill,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in the release. “Our farmers deserve leadership that will end this nonsense and let them make a living doing what they do best — feeding the world.” 
Ernst calls for selling ‘underutilized’ federal property
Sen. Joni Ernst introduced the FOR SALE act Wednesday to sell six vacant or “underutilized” federal properties in Washington D.C. In a press release, Ernst claimed selling the properties would generate $400 million in revenue and cancel over $2.9 billion in “overdue maintenance.”
Three of the six properties for sale are currently headquarters to cabinet agencies:
The James V. Forrestal Building, headquarters for the U.S. Department of Energy, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Hubert H. Humphrey Jr. building and the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, home to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
“The nonpartisan Public Buildings Reform Board says Washington’s ‘wasteful real estate practices would not endure for so long in a private sector company,” Ernst said on the Senate floor Thursday. “But when playing Washington-opoly, Uncle Sam doesn’t pay the costs for his wasteful decisions, you do!”
Nunn-led act to reduce regulations for small and mid-sized businesses unanimously passes House
Rep. Zach Nunn’s bipartisan ELEVATE act seeks to “reduce bureaucratic red-tape” for small and mid-sized businesses trying to raise capital investment. This bill will allow “emerging growth companies” to submit two years of audited financials instead of three when and seeks to reduce the cost and time burden of capital investment. The legislation was unanimously passed by House members Monday.
“When investment capital gets trapped on the coasts by large firms and D.C. regulators, it’s Iowa’s small businesses that suffer,” Nunn said in a press release. “The ELEVATE Act is a commonsense fix that would level the playing field for Iowa entrepreneurs looking to grow.”
Miller-Meeks reintroduces legislation to shield manufacturers from wildfire-related lawsuits 
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks reintroduced a bill to make manufacturers of critical infrastructure immune to wildfire-related lawsuits, “unless there is clear evidence of willful misconduct.” The bill was initially introduced by Miller-Meeks in 2024, but did not pass the House.
“No manufacturer should be driven out of business for building the components that power our homes, hospitals, and national defense,” said Miller-Meeks in a press release. “This bill protects the men and women who make the grid work, from transformers to transmission lines, and ensures they’re not punished for natural disasters beyond their control.”
Hinson reintroduces legislation to improve flood and drought mitigation
The Flood Resiliency and Land Stewardship Act reintroduced by Hinson seeks to bolster flood and drought mitigation programs through existing U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs. This bill would amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to include flood prevention and mitigation measures through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program.
“At the federal level, we must pursue proactive solutions that prioritize commonsense mitigation and flood prevention efforts to help save lives and livelihoods in the event of severe weather. While we can’t predict the weather, we can ensure we are prepared,” said Hinson in a press release. “I will continue working across the aisle to deliver certainty and protect our communities, businesses, and agriculture.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-27-at-4.01.23-PM-1024x554.png,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) Legislative Education Study Committee staff members Friday outlined their role in supporting the Public Education Department’s work in developing a plan for improving educational opportunities for at-risk New Mexico students.
LESC Director John Sena provided lawmakers with an update to the ongoing landmark Yazzie/Martinez educational equity case this week as they met in Roswell for the latest interim committee meeting. The remedial plan marks the latest court development in the lawsuit, which found in 2018 that the state was failing to provide low-income students, Native American students, English language learners and students with disabilities equitable education and services.
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson ordered the PED to develop the plan after parties returned to court in April to discuss the plaintiffs motion of non-compliance, filed in September 2024. Plaintiffs pointed to ongoing poor student performance and high turnover within the PED and proposed the LESC take the lead in developing an action plan. These specific markers were identified in a recent Legislative Finance Committee report shared with lawmakers this month.

Wilson agreed that a plan was needed, but decided that the PED would lead the development as the LESC is not a party in the case and the court does not have jurisdiction over the agency. However, the LESC was invited to assist the education department.
Sena shared a memo with lawmakers that the LESC sent to PED Secretary Mariana Padilla earlier this month that stated that agency staff would assist in an “advisory and technical role” by providing “nonpartisan research and fiscal analysis.” 
The memo also outlined several areas staff members will focus on, including participating in stakeholder meetings; providing relevant studies, original staff analysis and research concerning the at-risk student populations; identifying sections of state law that might need to be addressed; providing cost analysis for plan components; helping to identify characteristics of a suitable external consultant; and providing legislative context to the PED and consultant. 
“What we wanted to do for you all, as well as for clarity in terms of our partnership with the department, is say explicitly the kinds of things that we could do as staff to support that process so that there’s no muddiness around who’s doing what and who’s responsible for things. This is what we can lend our support to do,” Sena said during the meeting. 
The memo also noted that regular “coordination meetings” between the PED, LESC and external consultants would be beneficial.
The first deadline Wilson identified is July 1, by which PED is expected to identify an external consultant to develop the remedial plan. According to the LESC’s June newsletter, the PED issued a request for interest for a consultant and asked applicants to “describe their proposed approach to stakeholder engagement and how they would work with PED’s cabinet and legal counsel to develop a plan.”
PED spokesperson Janelle Garcia told Source NM that Padilla is in the process of communicating with applicants, but said a formal announcement of the chosen consultant will likely not be made until July 1.
Sena told lawmakers Friday that the PED received 10 to 14 applications and that the applicant pool was diverse, including national and New Mexico-based organizations. Once identified, the consultant will schedule meetings with stakeholders to help inform aspects of the plan.
“We have a really passionate group of what I like to call the usual suspects in education. These are folks who are really invested and we see them at our meetings, we see them at a lot of other stakeholder engagement opportunities.  Their voices are very powerful and important,” Sena said. “But I think it’s also important that we make sure we’re hearing from community members and a diverse group of folks that maybe we don’t always hear from, and so we’ll be putting that feedback forward for the [PED] to consider.”
The next deadline is Oct. 1, when the PED is expected to provide the court with a draft remedial plan. The department then has another month to finalize the plan. Plaintiffs then have until Dec. 1 to file objections to the plan with the court.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Yazzie-and-Travis-Mckenzie-embrace-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In the nearly 50 years since Alaskans overwhelmingly voted to create the Alaska Permanent Fund,  it has become a globally recognized sovereign wealth fund and a household name for every  Alaskan. It symbolizes the conservative nature and strength of character of our forebears, who  saved a portion of their generation’s money earned from Alaska’s natural resources to provide  financial benefits for all generations to come. The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation and our  dedicated team are tasked with and committed to protecting and growing the Permanent Fund for the benefit of every Alaskan. 
Alaska’s Permanent Fund has been an incredible success in achieving the shift from one-time resource revenue to a source of investment-driven renewable revenue. The first annual deposit of oil royalty revenue into the Permanent Fund was $734,000 in 1977. In the years since then, nearly $20 billion of state resource revenues have been saved and are part of the constitutionally protected principal of the Permanent Fund. An impressive achievement for our state, but dwarfed when compared to the investment performance during the same time frame that generated earnings totaling over $105 billion from our resource revenue savings.  
Fund earnings have been appropriated to pay the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, grow and inflation proof the Permanent Fund’s principal, and provide for state services. The permanently  protected principal has grown to $58.8 billion through royalty deposits, inflation proofing, and special appropriations. $47.5 billion has been paid out to support dividends and funding for  state services, and the balance of earnings has yet to be used.  











If you only fish for king salmon, you have a higher probability of a bad run and doing without than if you  also target sockeye, coho, dog, and pink salmon.



	The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation’s investment strategies and tactics are designed to make  sure that Alaskans consistently benefit from their fund in as broad a swath of economic times as  possible. At the heart of APFC’s strategy is an investment tactic referred to as diversification, or the practice of having a variety of investments that react differently from one another.  
Diversification is a means of stabilizing returns and mitigating risk. Many aspects of Alaskan life are great examples of this strategy. Take fishing, for example. If your goal today is to catch  enough salmon to feed your family through winter, you will better your chances by going after more than one species to reduce the potential risks of poor returns for any one species. If you only fish for king salmon, you have a higher probability of a bad run and doing without than if you  also target sockeye, coho, dog, and pink salmon. The diversification of the salmon species, habitat, foods, and run seasons creates greater assurance of catching than any single species can.  Diversification in investing is achieved by spreading investments across different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, infrastructure and private companies. As a result, if one part of  the market hits a rough patch, the entire fund isn’t dragged down with it. 
The board of trustees reviewed the fund’s overall investment mix at their most recent quarterly meeting. After thoughtful discussion and input from APFC staff and external advisors, the board maintained the current targets across the fund’s eight asset classes. This decision reflects our commitment to managing the fund for long-term performance to generate risk-aware returns while recognizing the importance of the annual 5% draw supporting state services and dividends.  While the board sets the allowed investments, it is the APFC team that brings the strategy to life. Our staff works every day to navigate changing markets and make careful decisions within the guardrails set by policy. This flexibility allows us to respond to economic shifts while staying  focused on the long-term goal: protecting and growing the fund for generations of Alaskans.  
Since the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund, Alaskans have demanded a conservative  approach to investing that provides long-term security and the ability to better withstand  inflationary and global economic swings. This approach means we aren’t putting all our assets in one type of investment but rather a diversified group of investments designed to have the highest chance of providing regular recurring funding for all of us today and for future generations of Alaskans.

Gavin Newsom for his signature, but it won’t take effect unless the Legislature makes changes to housing and infrastructure development rules that he has demanded.","In summary
A state budget is headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom for his signature, but it won’t take effect unless the Legislature makes changes to housing and infrastructure development rules that he has demanded.


After days of confusion in which a deal with Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to unravel over his demand to include new housing and infrastructure regulations, the California Legislature passed an updated state budget on Friday.
With the start of a new fiscal year looming on July 1, budget negotiations — already challenged by a $12 billion and growing deficit — dragged on this week as Newsom and legislative leaders struggled to reach an agreement on waiving state environmental reviews for priority projects.
The details of that proposal were only made public Friday morning, hours before the budget vote, despite a poison pill that would invalidate the entire $321 billion spending plan if the Legislature does not also approve the infrastructure proposal, Senate Bill 131. Lawmakers are expected to take it up on Monday, alongside the housing measure Newsom sought, Assembly Bill 130, which was unveiled and then amended this week following fierce blowback from organized labor.
Officials involved in those negotiations have been loath to explain why the budget process staggered to such an odd and protracted conclusion this year, even as California is now set to adopt sweeping changes to how it builds without much public notice. Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas refused to speak with reporters after the vote.
“I’m not going to comment on the process or any of that,” state Sen. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco Democrat who leads the Senate budget committee and was a driving force behind the infrastructure proposal, told CalMatters on Friday. “The people of California, I don’t think they care much about the timing. They just want us to deliver on making their lives more affordable.”
The Legislature, which already passed its own version of the budget earlier this month to meet a constitutional deadline, voted along largely partisan lines to approve the deal with Newsom. It will freeze enrollment of undocumented immigrants in California’s health care program for the poor, but relies on reserves and internal borrowing to avoid many other cuts to services that Democratic legislators opposed.
Republicans criticized the secretive deliberations and last-minute changes, noting that even some Democrats publicly complained this week about being sidelined from discussions with hugely consequential policy implications.
“I have been involved in more than a dozen public-sector budgets,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican, said on the Senate floor. “I have to say, this is the worst experience that I’ve had relative to navigating frustrations of the lack of transparency.”
But Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat who leads the Assembly budget committee, laughed off the drawn-out dealmaking, which he compared to one of his pregnant staffers.
“She was actually due to give birth five days ago, and so we’ve been having a debate in our office about which would come first: budget or baby,” Gabriel said on the Assembly floor. “Right now it looks like budget is going to win.”
California’s landmark environmental law at stake
The high-stakes showdown began last month, when Newsom endorsed two contentious pro-development bills by Bay Area Democrats and announced that he would fold them into the budget. Both make changes to the California Environmental Quality Act, which requires governments to study the environmental impacts of new housing and infrastructure projects they approve.
The five-decade-old law is sacrosanct to environmentalists, but critics argue that it has driven up the cost of building in California because studies and subsequent legal challenges, sometimes brought by construction unions or other groups that want concessions from developers, can take years to resolve. Newsom has framed his approach as a crucial reform to fix the state’s housing affordability crisis.
While the leadership of the Assembly got on board, the proposals were met with more skepticism in the Senate, where there is a growing rift among Democrats over whether simplifying project approvals without setting terms for affordable housing and labor standards is a giveaway to developers.

That prolonged the budget negotiations, even as Newsom and legislative leaders reached a difficult compromise on spending cuts.
When the budget bill eventually went into print on Tuesday, so that legislators would have enough time to pass it before July 1, officials were still haggling over the details of the infrastructure proposal. To ensure discussions would continue, Newsom demanded the inclusion of an unusual line stating that the budget “shall be inoperative and repealed” if SB 131 is not signed into law by June 30 at 11:59 p.m., though the measure was empty at that point.
The version that finally landed on Friday reduces the number of documents that projects must provide for their environmental reviews. It also eliminates the reviews entirely when cities rezone neighborhoods to meet their state-mandated housing goals, as well as for building a potpourri of other projects: farmworker housing, sewer systems in disadvantaged communities, broadband internet, public parks and trails, rural health clinics, food banks, advanced manufacturing facilities, day care centers and stations for the high-speed rail project.
‘Critical’ housing reforms
The related housing measure, intended as a grand political bargain to speed up construction in cities, threw another late wrench into the budget process.
It would exempt most new apartment buildings in already developed urban areas from environmental reviews, provided they meet local zoning rules. To secure support from organized labor, the bill originally created new wage floors for projects taking advantage of the law.
But powerful unions representing construction workers revolted after the proposal was introduced this week Their members crowded into hearings at the Capitol, casting it as a betrayal that would undercut higher “prevailing wage” standards that have long existed for publicly funded projects. Many Democratic lawmakers, who are closely allied with organized labor, eviscerated the measure.
Newsom and legislative leaders scrambled to contain the fallout. Amendments to the bill late Thursday stripped out the wage provisions while requiring projects taller than 85 feet or those that have 100% affordable units to offer prevailing wages if they want to access the expedited approval process. But that means many small apartment projects could sidestep environmental reviews without having to pay higher wages of any kind.
The bill retains another provision that unions asked for, giving them the right to take contractors to court for workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax violations.
Newsom praised the development proposals on Friday as a “triumph” and “one of the most significant housing reforms in California history” — so important to fixing the state’s shortage of affordable homes that they needed to be pushed through as quickly as possible.
“I did it because it’s critical and it’s essential that it was done,” Newsom told reporters in a virtual press conference. “We’ve got to get out of our own damn way.”

,DC,2025-06-27 21:36:55+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Weekend work on the mega-bill: first vote in US Senate as soon as Saturday,"Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/weekend-work-mega-bill-first-vote-us-senate-soon-saturday,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans appear ready to take an initial vote on their “big, beautiful bill” as soon as Saturday, which would set up final passage within a couple of days — though Majority Leader John Thune called the timeline “aspirational.”GOP senators have been negotiating the sweeping tax and spending cuts package for weeks, trying to ensure the dozens of provisions meet the complex rules for writing a reconciliation bill and can garner the support needed to actually become law.“We are continuing to explore options on all the outstanding issues,” Thune said Friday afternoon. But several Republican senators leaving a closed-door working lunch that lasted more than two hours told reporters they expect to see the final bill text possibly by Friday night before taking their first procedural vote at noon Eastern on Saturday.Republicans were still going back and forth with the Senate parliamentarian throughout the day as they tried to rework numerous policy changes she deemed not compliant with the guardrails for a reconciliation bill.The special legislative process gets Republicans around the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, but means the successful policy provisions need to have an effect on federal revenues, spending or the debt limit.There were still various outstanding disputes among GOP senators about how exactly the bill should be structured. If those are not resolved before amendment debate begins, it could lead to Republicans publicly splitting on issues related to Medicaid, tax policy and several other issues.Public lands, Medicaid provider taxMontana Sen. Steve Daines said he’s still waiting to see whether the parliamentarian accepts a revised proposal from Utah Sen. Mike Lee that would lead to a sell-off of some public lands.Daines didn’t want to comment on whether he’d bring up an amendment to strike the language from the bill, if it makes it into the final version of the package.""He's got to get it in the bill first. So it's a hypothetical at this point,” Daines said. “I think there's some trouble getting it through the parl. So I think that's the most likely scenario.”North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he believes Republicans have successfully reworked language addressing a change to the maximum percentage that states can set their Medicaid provider tax rate at. An earlier version reducing that rate from 6% to 3.5% over time was blocked by the parliamentarian. ""We think we've got it fixed, yeah. It's just like on a number of these issues. We think we have it fixed. We don't have the final word,” Hoeven said. “That's what we talked about earlier. We think we'll have the final word on this by the end of today, so we can start tomorrow.""The Medicaid provider tax rate would normally be considered in-the-weeds, but has become a central debate within the GOP amid major concerns about how changes would affect rural health care systems.Republicans may have also agreed to a final figure for a rural hospital fund meant to help offset the impact of Medicaid changes in the bill. That number will likely be higher than a previously floated $15 billion, but Hoeven didn’t say what the compromise will be. “The number you all saw is $15 billion. It's going to be bigger than that,” Hoeven said. “But I don't have a specific number yet.”Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins has been pressing for that fund to be at least $100 billion.SALT talksHoeven said that during the lunch, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., advocated for a $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, or SALT, for five years. The issue, also somewhat obscure, is crucial to the Senate bill making it back through the House, where GOP lawmakers from higher-tax states have been adamant the bill must help their constituents.Hoeven said the goal is to reach final agreement among Republicans and clear those changes with the parliamentarian, so the Senate can take its procedural vote on the bill Saturday around noon.Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said he thinks both chambers are getting close to reaching a final deal on the state and local tax deduction.“We still have some talking to do in the Senate, but I think we're getting close,” Mullin said, declining to get into numbers. Senators, he said, are planning to take the procedural vote around noon Saturday, setting up an amendment voting session that can last upwards of 12 hours and might begin later that day or Sunday morning.“There's a discussion about starting it earlier in the morning than in the middle of the night,” Mullin said. “So who knows?”The bill clearing the House could come shortly after the Senate passes its version of the package, since that chamber’s 72-hour rule starts winding down once the Senate’s bill text is released, not once the Senate actually passes it.“Putting on my hat from the House side. The 72-hour rule may not even have to be applied here because we're amending the bill that's already been put out,” Mullin said. “But I think what Speaker Johnson wants to do is give adequate time to go through it, which would be kind of a 72-hour rule anyway.”Artificial intelligenceTexas Sen. Ted Cruz also said he expects the chamber will take the procedural vote around noon Saturday.Cruz expressed confidence that a section in his committee’s bill preventing state and local governments from regulating artificial intelligence if they want part of a $500 million fund will survive a possible floor amendment.“The provision is in the bill and I believe it will be in the final bill that passes,” Cruz said, appearing to brush aside weeks of criticism from fellow GOP lawmakers. Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno was optimistic that both chambers will be able to pass the package before the party’s self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.“Look, ultimately, at the end of the day, we'll be in good shape. We're going to get a bill across the finish line,” Moreno said. “The sausage-making can be ugly, but the final product is delicious.”Sen. Ron Johnson was not as upbeat as some of his colleagues, storming up the steps just outside the closed-door lunch after it wrapped up, not wanting to speak to reporters.“Notice I'm not really wanting (to) talk right now,” the Wisconsin Republican said.“Go back downstairs,” he told a large group of reporters.Asked about the timing of the procedural vote this weekend, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley said, ""it's going to be brought up ... there's no question about that.”“The question is, on final passage, will we need the vice president?” Grassley said. “And I'm glad he's a Republican, but we gotta get it passed.”",,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(South Dakota Searchlight photos)With just under a year to go before the 2026 primary election, Republican political dominoes have begun to fall in South Dakota.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson said Friday that he’ll make a “political announcement” Monday — widely expected to be a run for governor. 
Earlier Friday, state Attorney General Marty Jackley said he’s “preparing to run” for the seat Johnson will apparently vacate.
Jackley made his announcement to KELOLAND news in a story published Friday morning, saying “the fight is in Washington.”
“From fentanyl and methamphetamine pouring across the southern border to public corruption and wasteful spending in Washington, I want to work with President Trump to find solutions,” Jackley said in a KELO video.
Hours later, Johnson sent a press release saying he’ll make his own announcement at noon Monday at the Canopy by Hilton in Sioux Falls. He did not specify what he will announce.


Let us know what you think...


 

For Johnson, a run for governor would be the culmination of a political journey two decades in the making. The 48-year-old is in the midst of his fourth term in the U.S. House after previously serving as an elected member of South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission from 2004 to 2011. He served as chief of staff to then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard from 2011 to 2014 and then worked in the private sector for Vantage Point Solutions, a telecommunications company in Mitchell, prior to his election to Congress.
Johnson brings a load of campaign cash to the race, with more than $6 million of total money spread among his federal campaign committee and several federal or state political action committees.
Jackley, 54, previously served as U.S. attorney for South Dakota and then as attorney general, but his political career was interrupted by a loss to Kristi Noem in the 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary race. Jackley was again elected attorney general in 2022.
It was Noem’s departure from the governor’s office in January — with two years left in her final term — that triggered the current maneuvering in the South Dakota Republican Party. Noem is now leading the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Noem’s lieutenant governor, Larry Rhoden, took over as governor and is serving the remainder of Noem’s term. He has not announced whether he will seek the party’s nomination for governor in the June 2026 primary.
Two other candidates have already announced their bids for the Republican gubernatorial nomination: state House Speaker Jon Hansen and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden. Robert Arnold, a 19-year-old college student, has announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination.
Jackley is the first candidate to publicly announce his intention to run for the U.S. House. 
Jackley’s announcement will trigger a race for attorney general. Other major offices up for election next year in South Dakota include the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mike Rounds, who is expected to seek reelection. Democratic businessman and former state trooper Julian Beaudion is seeking his party’s nomination to challenge Rounds. Brian Bengs, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat against U.S. Sen. John Thune in 2022, has said he will run as an independent next year against Rounds.

Vermont schools are slated to receive $17 million in federal Covid-19 funds that were canceled by the Trump administration in March. 
The U.S. Department of Education reversed its decision to cancel the funding after a lawsuit led by 16 states and the District of Columbia, according to a Friday press release from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The decision also reinstates about $2.5 billion in K-12 funding for schools across the nation derived from the American Rescue Plan Act.
“This means that 19 school districts in our state will now receive funding that had been denied so that they can go forward with a wide variety of projects: summer programs, afterschool programs, school renovation,” Sanders said in a video message.

Sanders, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he spoke several times with Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, urging her to reverse the cuts. He also worked with 19 school districts in the state to present 88 appeals to the fund cancellations.
“The (Vermont Agency of Education) is encouraged by this development and is working diligently to confirm allowable project costs and next steps associated with the announced changes in process. We are committed to continuing to partner closely with every impacted district and will be providing more details and next steps to the field through our weekly office hours,” Toren Ballard, director of policy and communications at the Vermont Agency of Education, told VTDigger following the announcement.
The money, originally allocated through a Covid-19 grant — the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds, or ESSER — had to be spent by Sept. 30, 2024, but the Biden administration approved an extension, so schools could continue using the remaining funds during the 2025-26 school year.
“We used the funds for specific purposes including employing targeted staff for instructional interventions and we also used a considerable portion to fund our summer academy program for students as we were placing an emphasis on learning loss as a result of COVID,” Harwood Unified Union School District Superintendent Mike Leichliter wrote in a statement to VTDigger.
Leichliter said the previously allocated funds have already been used, but the school district is waiting to receive the final $502,000 ESSER grant payment. 
“During a time of tremendous financial stress on our education system in Vermont, if the originally promised federal funds were not released, it would have led to increased pressure on our schools,” he wrote.

The state’s new program was slated to start releasing funds to families for private schooling and other non-public school costs on Tuesday. Now, a judge has temporarily blocked the release of any funds.
The post Judge orders Wyoming to temporarily withhold school voucher payments  appeared first on WyoFile .","A Laramie County District Court judge on Friday blocked Wyoming from releasing funds related to its new universal school voucher program until he issues a written order on a lawsuit against the state.  
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act was slated to begin sending out money on Tuesday. Since applications opened in May, Wyoming families have submitted nearly 4,000 student applications. The program would give applicants up to $7,000 annually in public funds for private education costs — though money would go directly from the state to providers.   
However, a June 13 lawsuit filed by the Wyoming Education Association and several parents challenged the program’s constitutionality and asked for a preliminary injunction to block it from going into effect. 
Judge Peter Froelicher granted a temporary injunction Friday. His decision essentially means that while the voucher program can continue to vet and accept applications, it cannot begin to disburse scholarship money. 
“I will take the matter under advisement, issue a written decision,” Froelicher said at the end of the Laramie County District Court hearing. “In the interim, I am going to narrowly enjoin the expenditure of any funds. The program may continue otherwise preparing for the expenditure of funds … I don’t see the harm in that at this point.”
Froelicher believes he can issue his written order by “mid-July-ish,” he said. 
The judge also granted a motion to intervene filed by two Wyoming families represented by EdChoice Legal Advocates and the Institute for Justice. Those families sought to join the state to defend the law so their children can access the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act funds. 
The outcome of the case will shape the landscape of school choice in Wyoming and answer a long-asked question about the state’s constitutional right to give public money to families, regardless of need, for private school costs. 
School choice expansion 
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act represents a significant expansion of school choice in the state, offering families $7,000 per child annually for K-12 non-public-school costs like tuition or tutoring. The scholarship also offers money for pre-K costs, but only to income-qualified families at or below 250% of the federal poverty level.
It comes as a school-choice movement mounts nationwide, particularly among conservatives.

Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, who sponsored and championed the Steamboat Scholarship bill, called the state’s 2024 education savings account program much too narrow. His 2025 bill, in its original form, made the program universal and dropped the preschool component, statewide assessments or similar nationwide tests for students and a requirement that providers be certified by the Department of Education.
The bill ignited one of the hottest debates of the recent session. It sparked a deluge of constituent feedback, according to lawmakers, both from supporters of school choice and critics who called it an unconstitutional measure that will erode the quality of public education inWyoming. 
Lawmakers transformed it before it passed out of the Legislature; they brought 26 amendments, including 11 that passed. The final version reinstated the assessment requirements, the provider certification and the inclusion of pre-K, though families have to show income need to qualify for that portion. 
Legislators repeatedly questioned the constitutionality of the expanded program. Many also urged the body to hold off and allow the existing ESA program to roll out and work out any bugs before changing it so drastically. 
The lawsuit
Nine parents of school-aged children and the Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, filed the lawsuit June 13. Parents reside in counties across the state. Many have children who receive special education services through public school or are queer or non-binary.
The lawsuit argues the voucher program violates the Wyoming Constitution, which makes public education a paramount state commitment. It asks the court to block the voucher program with a preliminary injunction. 
A previous Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on education funding “found that ‘education is a fundamental right’ in Wyoming, that ‘all aspects of the school finance system are subject to strict scrutiny,’ and that ‘any state action interfering with [the right to equal educational opportunity] must be closely examined before it can be said to pass constitutional muster,’” the lawsuit reads.
This voucher program, the lawsuit asserts, does not pass that muster. That’s because “the state cannot circumvent those requirements by funding private education that is not uniform and that meets none of the required state constitutional standards for education.”
In addition, the program is unconstitutional because it violates constitutional language that allows the state to funnel public funds to private entities only for the necessary support of the poor, the lawsuit reads. 
Parents who signed onto the case oppose the voucher plan due to the harmful impact it will have on their children, according to the lawsuit, “because private schools receiving voucher funding can refuse admission to children with disabilities … and are not required to provide special education services or comply with [individualized education programs].” They are also concerned that private schools can refuse to admit and educate children who identify as queer, transgender or non-binary.

The voucher program will also negatively impact funding at public schools that the parents’ children attend, the lawsuit says, because as students leave public schools, they will lose funding under models that rely on enrollment numbers. 
The Wyoming Legislature has established standards and oversight concerning the nature and quality of education that Wyoming students receive in public schools. But there is no mechanism to authorize Wyoming’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder to ensure those same standards and quality are furnished through the voucher program, the lawsuit states.
“Despite charging the Superintendent with administering the Program, the statute explicitly deprives her of any authority to ensure students utilizing the program receive a quality education,” the lawsuit reads. “In effect, the Program is a black box: funds will go in, but except in isolated instances the state and the public will have no way to know what is coming out.”
Nothing in the statute, the lawsuit concludes, “prevents instruction from being perfunctory, or worse.”
The lawsuit comes on the heels of a significant court decision that resulted from another Wyoming Education Association lawsuit filed in 2022. That legal challenge argued that the state violated its constitution by failing to adequately fund public schools and withholding appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security. Eight school districts joined the lawsuit as intervenors to challenge the state.
In that case, Judge Froelicher ruled in favor of plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to fix a funding formula he determined to be impacting Wyoming children’s right to a proper education.
Defense and intervenors
On Friday, the state’s attorney, Mackenzie Williams, argued that the voucher program does not pose imminent or irreparable harm to the plaintiffs’ right to education, and therefore the judge should not approve a preliminary injunction. 
The voucher program is funded by the general fund, not school funds, he said, “and so I would say it’s not part of the school finance system.”

The real question for the court ultimately to decide, Williams said, is whether or not the Legislature is meeting its constitutional duty to provide adequate education in public schools. If it is, the constitution does not prohibit the Legislature from creating other educational programs, he argued.
Thomas Fisher, representing the intervenors, said the two families he’s representing and thousands of others in Wyoming are “ready and in the process of signing their agreements to receive these ESAs.
“That is the status quo that the plaintiffs seek to upend,” he said, adding that only a clear showing of unconstitutionality plus proof of irreparable harm are sufficient to disrupt that status quo while the case plays out further. 
The pause of those funds, he said, will result in “significant financial harm” for the families expecting and planning on the money.
Following the hearing, Wyoming Education Association President Kim Amen celebrated the court’s “careful approach” in temporarily pausing the program. 
“Preserving the status quo allows time for a thorough review of the legal and constitutional issues involved, which are of great importance to Wyoming’s public education system,” Amen said. “We believe it’s critical that public funds remain dedicated to supporting the public schools that serve 93% of Wyoming’s students.”
Americans For Prosperity Wyoming, which lobbied heavily for the universal school voucher program during the legislative session, condemned Amen’s association Friday for hindering educational choice. 
“Today’s injunction is the latest effort by self-absorbed teachers’ union officials to stand in the way of Wyoming families’ ability to secure the best education possible for their children,” Americans For Prosperity Wyoming State Director Tyler Lindholm said in a statement.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach encouraged the Kansas State Board of Education to remove sex discrimination language from the state’s lunch contracts, the latest in his offensive against gender and identity politics.
In a letter to state education commissioner Randy Watson and board chair Cathy Hopkins, Kobach requested the board “comply with federal law and recent court rulings.” He took issue with wording in contracts for child nutrition and wellness programs, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include gender identity and sexual orientation.
“The inclusion of such language in school contracts is not only unnecessary but also contrary to federal law and the recent court ruling,” Kobach said Thursday in a news release.
In his first days in office, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that did away with diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, including broader definitions of gender identity and sex discrimination. Kobach said those orders, along with a Biden-era Title IX court case led by Kobach, are enough to warrant modification of school lunch contracts
The letter comes in the same week Kobach requested the U.S. Department of Education investigate four Kansas school districts that have policies allowing teachers to maintain confidentiality with children who are socially transitioning, which refers to the changes a person makes to the way they present themselves to align with their gender identity.
The four school districts in Kansas City, Olathe, Shawnee Mission and Topeka were the subject of a Title IX complaint from the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a conservative nonprofit founded by two former Trump administration officials.
The Kansas State Board of Education is scheduled to meet on July 8 and 9. Its agenda indicates the board will discuss Kobach’s letter at the end of its July 8 meeting.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170169-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

This was the first of two major steps in completing the strategic combination of the two Catholic colleges, the next being approval by the U.S. Department of Education. Presidents of both universities came together with university staff and alumni on the Mount Mercy campus in Cedar Rapids Friday to announce the news and sign a pledge of shared commitment to their missions.
St. Ambrose President Amy Novak said approval is set to come through next summer, which is when the schools will fully combine.
“With the conclusion of this first step, St. Ambrose University now serves as the corporate owner of Mount Mercy University,” Novak said. “This action, however, is not a diminishment of one university or another, but rather a bold affirmation that together, we are all stronger.”

After about 18 months of work, Novak and Mount Mercy University President Todd Olson made the agreement in August 2024 for St. Ambrose in Davenport to eventually own Mount Mercy while maintaining its campus, branding and programming.
Twenty “integration teams” made up of staff, faculty, students, alumni and community members at both campuses have been working together on areas from information technology and back-end business to graduate programs, academic affairs, alumni and more — essentially helping the combination process cross the finish line, Novak said.
The groups vote every two weeks on decisions for the combination, like approving curriculum and the academic calendar. Novak said all the efforts being made are with the commitment to “carry forward the legacy and the charisms of both institutions with reverence” and find a place where everyone belongs.
“This is not simply one plus one equaling two,” Novak said. “This is one plus one equaling four or 10 or something even greater, as new synergies emerge and our shared mission and vision deepens.”
Along with celebration came concerns about how the combination could impact student finances or enrollment, to which Novak responded that tuition will remain the same at Mount Mercy and no scholarship awards will be changed “at this juncture.” Enrollment looks strong at both institutions, she added, though final numbers are not yet available.
Olson said he’s heard from students and families that the combination has inspired “renewed confidence” in the university’s future, which is helping to drive enrollment alongside the addition of a college football team.
Responding to a question about actions in Washington, D.C., impacting the combination process, Olson said current practices and future aspirations of the institutions appeal to “a variety of political perspectives,” as both universities operate based on their values and best practices to help students become professionals prepared for the workplace.
“We believe we are already providing a set of outcomes and services and people that are well-regarded across the political spectrum, and it’s certainly our intention to continue doing that,” Olson said.
The combination has drawn support from business and city leaders as well, Novak said, as it will bring new resources and more opportunities for partnership to the table for community development.
While it will bring benefits across the board to both university communities, Olson said the enduring goal behind Mount Mercy and St. Ambrose coming together is to provide the best possible education for their students and to ensure Catholic higher education’s future in eastern Iowa.
“This day represents a bright path forward for Mount Mercy and for St. Ambrose, and as we march down that path from here, we keep our mission at the center, and we keep our students at the center of our mission,” Olson said.

A Florida man who served his prison sentence handed down more than three years ago for his role in the EB-5 fraud that rocked Vermont is now seeking to shorten the length of his court-ordered supervised release.
An attorney for William Kelly filed a motion this week in federal court in Burlington asking Judge Geoffrey Crawford to end Kelly’s three years of supervised release a year earlier. 
“Mr. Kelly has used this experience to become a more responsible and accountable person,” Robert Goldstein, Kelly’s lawyer, wrote in a court filing. “He has demonstrated the stability and commitment to live a law-abiding life and would be grateful for the opportunity to continue doing so without the restrictions of supervised release.”
Neither Goldstein nor the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Vermont, which prosecuted the case, could be reached Friday for comment.

Crawford sentenced Kelly in April 2022 to 18 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to two charges: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and concealment of material information.
The judge also ordered Kelly to serve three years of supervised release following his prison sentence. The terms of Kelly’s supervised release include regular check-ins with his probation officer and travel restrictions.
Kelly, according to court records, was a key adviser to Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak ski resort, and an “assistant in executing decisions” who later took the lead in developing what regulators have termed a “Ponzi-like” scheme.
Kelly was indicted by a federal grand jury in Vermont in May 2019 along with Quiros and Bill Stenger, Jay Peak’s former president and CEO, for his role in a failed biomedical research facility planned for Newport.
More than 160 foreign investors seeking green cards in exchange for their investments each put at least $500,000 into the proposed $110 million facility known as AnC Bio Vermont.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later termed the project “nearly a complete fraud,” leaving the investors out of their investment and no way to meet the job creating requirements to secure their U.S. residency through the EB-5 visa program.
Prosecutors termed Kelly the “consummate fixer” who worked at trying to “outwit” regulators.
Stenger was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the case and has since been released. Quiros was sentenced to a five-year prison term that he continues to serve. 
Kelly, according to his attorney’s recent filing, in addition to serving out his prison sentence has roughly one year remaining of his three years of supervised release. 
Kelly, now 76, suffers from several medical conditions, including chronic diabetes and heart disease, the filing stated. 
“Since returning to the community, Mr. Kelly has worked diligently to rebuild and contribute positively,” his attorney wrote in the motion. “His family, church, and community have all been vital in his transformation, and he takes pride in trying to give back to his community in meaningful ways.”
Also, Kelly has been making his required monthly payments on the roughly $8.3 million in restitution that was part of his sentence, the filing stated. 
“Mr. Kelly also intends to continue paying restitution going forward; indeed, these payments are deducted from his social security benefits,” the filing stated.
The document does not specifically state how much Kelly pays monthly toward his restitution. However, other court filings show that the minimum payments were to be 10% of his gross earnings.
Crawford has made no ruling on Kelly’s motion for early termination of his supervised release and it’s not clear when that would take place, or if a hearing will be held on the matter.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A new report issued by legislative analysts on state election spending prompted a rebuttal to lawmakers Thursday from New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts report the Secretary of State’s office spent funding set aside for 2025 on the 2024 primaries, concluding that while the Department of Finance and Administration approved the action, it potentially meant the Legislature would have to provide additional funds for future costs, and likely violated the state Constitution.
The report notes that the cost of New Mexico elections has nearly tripled in recent years, in part due to major reform efforts by the Legislature allowing the state to manage local elections for cities and counties. The state spent approximately $15 million per election in 2024, according to the report.
Consolidating elections at the state level “can lead to greater efficiency and consistency,” the report says, but also opens the state to further risks. The largest costs in the elections included poll worker salaries, the number of polling locations and rising costs for election equipment.
The report notes the state could save $3.2 million by cutting 285 polling sites.
The report concludes the Secretary of State’s office needs to better predict the costs of elections by collecting more data for specific county costs; establishing further reimbursement guidelines; finding savings on election equipment; and potentially cutting state payments for county-determined polling sites and poll workers.
Toulouse Oliver told lawmakers the one finding of concern — that the office violated the state Constitution with election spending from a $15 million fund created by the Legislature in 2024 — came at the direction of the Department of Finance and Administration and LFC Director Charles Sallee.
“I want to be very clear that was not our idea of how to do things, and in fact, I expressed my opinion that it was very, very bad public policy,” she said.
In an interview with Source, Sallee described Toulouse Oliver’s comments as “pretty misleading testimony in my view.”
Sallee characterized the conversation he had with Toulouse Oliver as one that established the New Mexico Department of Finance Authority’s power to reimburse counties for expenses in the new fiscal year, for prior elections when legislation establishing the state’s $15 million Election Fund went into effect.
“It wasn’t like we told them to overspend; they had already overspent,” Sallee told Source.
Toulouse Oliver on Thursday criticized the report for being rushed, saying it provided “incomplete and premature conclusions.” Toulouse Oliver also noted that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had ranked New Mexico elections first in the nation last year for both security and accessibility.
“This is the first evaluation LFC has conducted on elections and it really failed to reflect the nuance, expertise and complexity,” she said.
In a rebuttal letter submitted alongside the report, Toulouse Oliver wrote: “Cutting funding for elections in New Mexico risks undoing all the great progress that has been made to modernize our elections in recent years and could compromise election security and voter accessibility.”
The recommendations to cut polling places, for example, could require voters to travel longer distances to cast a ballot, she said, adding the placement of voting centers should be left up to the counties.
Toulouse Oliver Legislature requested lawmakers provide funding for operations, as well as  projects for cybersecurity, data collection and education for both voters and county staff.
“We did not have enough money to get through this last pay period this year,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) asked Toulouse Oliver if the state would save money by conducting elections fully by mail, which occurs in Colorado, Utah, Washington and Oregon.
Toulouse Oliver said her successor — she is term-limited from running again — would be the best person to consider that change, but said it would most likely cut costs, especially when it comes to pollworkers.
“We’d still need a lot of people to help process those ballots but it wouldn’t be the number we’re using now,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Toulouse Oliver concluded by saying her office was aligned with many of the recommendations put forward.
“We think a lot of the recommendations in this report are good, and a lot of them are things we’re already working on,” she said. “We just need your help to get them over the finish line.”

Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

(File photo by Getty Images)Some 290 South Carolinians will lose their jobs as a pair of lumber mills close in the Pee Dee and Lowcountry.
Canfor Corp. announced Friday it would shutdown two of its South Carolina sawmills — one in Darlington and another in rural Hampton County, near the small town of Estill.
“We understand the significant impact this difficult decision will have on our employees,” Canfor Southern Pine President Lee Goodloe said in a statement.
The Darlington plant employs about 120 people, and the Estill plant employs about 170 people. Layoffs will start Aug. 25 and continue over the next six months, according to filings with the S.C. Department of Employment and Workforce.
Canfor attributed the closure to “persistently weak market conditions and sustained financial losses.”
The company, which operates in the southeastern United States, western Canada and Sweden, suffered a $942 million operating loss in 2024 and $29 million of losses in the first three months of 2025, according to earnings statements. Much of that loss came from U.S. operations and low demand for the southern yellow pine common to South Carolina.
“Looking ahead, North American lumber markets are anticipated to experience continued volatility and uncertainty throughout the second quarter of 2025. Ongoing affordability challenges and tariff-related disruptions to traditional trade flows are projected to result in tepid demand in the near term,” the company wrote in its latest financial report.
Canfor had already curtailed one shift at its Darlington facility and reduced operating hours in Estill.
Lumber mill pledges 125 new jobs in rural Allendale County

In Hampton County, the Estill mill was one of just six employers with more than 100 workers, according to the state employment agency.
But with one loss comes a different gain.
The Estill mill sits just across the county line and less than 15 miles away from a new sawmill planned for Allendale County.
Hampton Lumber announced Tuesday that the town of Fairfax would become home to its first East Coast sawmill, employing 125 South Carolinians. Production is scheduled to begin in 2027.
Canfor continues to operate mills in Camden and Conway, as well as a smaller facility in Marion and a corporate office in Myrtle Beach, according to its website.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wood-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X video)Two environmental groups filed a lawsuit in a South Florida federal court on Friday over the immigration detention center under construction in the Everglades that has been dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
They later filed a motion for expedited relief, seeking entry of a temporary restraining order by July 1.
Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed the suit in the U.S. District Court Southern District of Florida against federal, state, and local agencies: the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Florida Division of Management, and Miami-Dade County.
The environmental groups complain the plan has not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law, and that the public has not had an opportunity to comment.
“The site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida Panther and other iconic species,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “The scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect.”
The plan has developed at lightning speed. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier first announced “Alligator Alcatraz” in a video posted on his X account eight days earlier, on June 19. In that video, he announced that the facility would hold up to 1,000 undocumented migrants (state officials have since revised that total to as many as 5,000 detainees).
The site is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport on land owned by Miami-Dade County. The Florida Division of Emergency Management reached out last week to Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and offered to purchase the land for $20 million. Levine Cava said that figure was “vastly lower” than the more recent appraisal of the site, “which is at least $190 million.”
Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Division of Emergency Management, responded that his agency would seize the property pursuant to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ powers originally dating from a January 2023 executive order declaring a state of emergency “due to the mass migration of illegal aliens to Florida.”
Groups claim the plan threatens the restoration of the Everglades 
The two groups claim in the lawsuit that the division holds no independent authority to construct and manage a correctional facility and attempting to do so exceeds the scope of authority granted by Florida law.
They also contend that “the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services system, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts” to listed species, wetlands, and surface waters.
Friends of the Everglades is requesting that the court declare that the project violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and stop the state from authorizing or permitting further development or use of the site for purposes of a detention center.
“This plan has had none of the environmental review that’s required by federal law,” said Tania Galloni, managing attorney for the Florida office of Earthjustice, which represents Friends of the Everglades in the lawsuit. “Cruelty aside, it defies common sense to put a mass of people, vehicles, and development in one of the most significant wetlands in the world. That’s why we’re going to court.”
Speaking live from the site on Fox and Friends on Friday morning, DeSantis said the facility could be ready to receive detainees by next Tuesday.
The governor has waved away any environmental threat. “I think people are just trying to say that because they just don’t want Florida assisting with the deportations. There’s a lot of people that want to have open borders. I get that. But that’s not the policy of the state. So, we’re going to do it,” he said Thursday.
Democrats question the timing of the plan
Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, a group of Florida Senate Democrats said that the DeSantis administration withheld the plan from public eye until after lawmakers left Tallahassee earlier this month upon the conclusion of their extended session.
“The announcement of the so-called Alligator Alcatraz has been timed intentionally to avoid legislative oversight,” Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith told reporters in a news conference Friday.
“It’s meant to get Trump’s attention and to distract from the Medicaid dollar-laundering scheme that found this attorney general under intense scrutiny and investigation, even from the Republican-led Florida House of Representatives,” Smith said. “It’s an attempt to distract from his contempt of court charges that he has been facing as well.”
Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman said her caucus was not aware of the plan before it was made public and its quick announcement-to-roll-out “leads me to believe that this was on the books for a much longer time period.”
The narrowly post-session announcement “leads me to believe that that was purposeful and that it was an idea that they intended to move forward with, but they didn’t want it to be done when the Legislature was in session,” Berman said.
The senators remarked on the political aspect of the facility, noting that the Republican Party of Florida is fundraising off the alliterative name, selling T-shirts and other merchandise.
“This isn’t about safety, it’s about scoring more political points by targeting immigrants and fueling fear,” Sen. Shevrin Jones said.
Berman sent a letter to Uthmeier and DeSantis Friday morning contending the plan has the potential to “constitute cruel and unusual punishment.”
“We as Democrats are looking at making Florida more affordable and not spending half a billion dollars on a prison camp in the middle of the Everglades,” Berman said.
She questioned whether DeSantis was using emergency orders in the “spirit” of what they are meant for.
Despite “being done under the guise of an emergency order. And yes, the letter of the law has been followed,” Berman acknowledged. “What is the emergency in the state of Florida, that we need to build this facility under this time frame?”
Smith called it a “dangerous escalation” that “clearly has serious environmental and human rights implications.”
“There’s no way that those temporary facilities that are intended to shelter people after a storm will be sufficient during a storm,” he said, adding that the Division of Emergency Management is involved with this operation during hurricane season.
Neither the governor’s nor attorney general’s office responded to Phoenix requests for comment relating to Democrats’ concerns in time for publication of the story.

(Courtesy of the University of Virginia)In a stunning development that’s igniting fierce political backlash, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan resigned Friday under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleged the school had failed to fully dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs — a demand tied to a sweeping federal crackdown on higher education.
The New York Times first reported Ryan’s resignation, citing DOJ claims that the institution had merely rebranded its DEI efforts instead of eliminating them. The university’s Board of Visitors accepted his resignation, with Ryan expected to officially step down by Aug. 15 after becoming the president in 2018. He has not commented publicly.
The move has sparked outrage on campus and across Virginia. A protest led by Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, is scheduled at the Rotunda on Friday.
“This unprecedented political interference threatens the independence of our University and its fundamental values,” a letter from the chairs of Wahoos4UVA Advisory Council states. “Whatever reason the Department of Justice gives for taking this action is only a pretext thinly masking a partisan agenda. What’s happening is clear: The Trump administration has made UVA the next target in its escalating attack on higher education in America.”
UVA became the first public university in Virginia to dissolve its DEI office on March 8 after President Donald Trump’s executive order warned of t federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
Opponents of DEI argue hiring and promotions should be merit-based rather than consider race or gender. Supporters say DEI efforts are vital to addressing systematic inequities that have long blocked opportunities for women and people of color and women.
The school has also been under scrutiny for its handling of antisemitism complaints. UVA was among 60 colleges flagged in a federal inquiry over whether it adequately protected Jewish students, prompting additional concerns over potential funding losses.
Virginia Senate Democrats condemned what they called federal overreach, urging university boards to “resist any efforts by the Trump Admin to dictate how Virginia runs its own taxpayer-funded schools.”



Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “UVA is the envy of American public universities,” and called Ryan an “incredible leader.” He added: “Trump’s interference in the operation of Virginia’s universities and any cooperation by those sworn to protect them will not be tolerated by the Virginia Senate.”
U.S. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also blasted the DOJ’s involvement, underscoring that Virginia’s economy and prosperity depend on the strength and integrity of the state’s higher education system.
“It is outrageous that officials in the Trump Department of Justice demanded the commonwealth’s globally recognized university remove President Ryan — a strong leader who has served UVA honorably and moved the university forward — over ridiculous ‘culture war’ traps,” the senators stated. “Decisions about UVA’s leadership belong solely to its Board of Visitors, in keeping with Virginia’s well-established and respected system of higher education governance. This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future.”
The UVA Board of Visitors last met June 4-6. Its next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 11-12.

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
 Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case

It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 20:30:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Tong confident on birthright citizenship amid Supreme Court ruling,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/william-tong-supreme-court-birthright-citizenship/,William Tong said he believes the court will declare a ban on birthright citizenship unconstitutional but fears chaos in the near term.,"A U.S Supreme Court decision Friday in a birthright citizenship case joined by Connecticut cast a shadow over the authority of federal judges who repeatedly have frustrated President Donald Trump’s executive orders with nationwide injunctions.
In a 6-3 decision, the court did not resolve the constitutionality of one of Trump’s earliest and most provocative executive orders — a denial of birthright citizenship ensconced in the Constitution and affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Instead, the court faulted district court judges who blocked the order in every state, not just in Connecticut and the other states who challenged it. 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett said, in a majority opinion praised by Trump, that the administration was likely to prevail in its claims that a nationwide or “universal injunction” exceeded the power granted to the judiciary. She acknowledged “some say” it is a check on the Executive Branch.
“But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them. When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too,” Barrett wrote.
William Tong, the attorney general of Connecticut, one of 18 states in a coalition that sued the Trump administration over the birthright order, said he was confident of the court eventually declaring the order to be unconstitutional but feared chaos in the near term.
The court left open the possibility that the ban could take effect after a 30-day period in the dozens of states that did not challenge the order.
“That’s the chaos and the uncertainty that comes from the president’s unlawful executive order,” said Tong. “This entire citizenship regime that we’ve relied on for more than 150 years, it upends it all.”
In a press conference in Hartford and on a separate Zoom call with the attorneys general of California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Washington, all states that have sued Trump to preserve birthright citizenship, Tong and his colleagues emphasized the limits of the decision.
“The court very clearly did not address the merits of birthright citizenship, and they, in fact, stayed the executive order for another 30 days for everyone. So let’s be clear, birthright citizenship remains the law of the land in states like New Jersey and in every state across the country,” said Matthew Platkin, the attorney general of New Jersey.
Tong, a Chinese-American born in Hartford to immigrant parents, calls the birthright issue personal. There is a uniquely Chinese aspect to the history of birthright citizenship, as established by the 14th Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
The full reach of the 14th Amendment was not affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court until 1898, a period of deep anti-Chinese sentiment. Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco, was denied reentry to the U.S. after a trip to China under the Chinese Exclusion Act.
“I’m here this morning, not just because I’m an attorney general and I represent the great state of Connecticut, but because I, too, am Wong Kim Ark. There are millions of Americans who share Wong Kim Ark’s story,” Tong said.
The limited decision was not unexpected, as it resulted from an emergency hearing focused on the reach of the injunctions, not the constitutionality of the president’s executive order. But the attorneys general still expressed disappointment.
“I think the Supreme Court had the opportunity to provide clarity for the entire nation, to reaffirm what has been the law of this land for over 150 years, and missed that opportunity with this order this morning,” said Nick Brown, the attorney general of Washington state. “But what the court did not do was negate any of the substantive arguments that the states made in bringing challenges to this blatantly unconstitutional executive order.”
According to the Congressional Research Service, at least 25 universal injunctions had been issued in response to executive orders issued in the first three months of the second Trump administration, challenging decisions on suspending federal spending, ending diversity programs, firing employees and other actions. 
Every president in recent decades has faced them: The CRS reported 12 nationwide injunctions were issued during the presidency of George W. Bush, 19 during Barack Obama’s presidency, and 55 during the first Trump Administration.
Tong noted that the limit on universal injunctions was doubled-edged. Trump’s allies applauded some previous ones, most notably one that limited the availability of the abortion drug, mifepristone.
“And so I think they have to tread very carefully, because what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. And if they want to go in and open up a can of worms, well, we’re going to open up a can of worms, too,” Tong said.
Tong said the decision had no immediate impact on other injunctions, but he said states that did not participate in challenges that produced universal injunction most likely appreciated them.
“Your federal funding, your NIH funding, birthright citizenship in your states, has not been cut or eliminated because Connecticut acted,” Tong said.
The three liberal justices dissented. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the injunctive authority was a vital check on executive power.
“The power to compel the Executive to follow the law is particularly vital where the relevant law is the Constitution,” she wrote. “But when the Executive violates the Constitution, the only recourse is the courts. Eliminate that check, and our government ceases to be one of ‘limited powers.’”
Trump said the decision takes away power from left-wing judges, though some of the orders had been delivered by Republican appointees.
“I was elected on a historic mandate, but in recent months, we’ve seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers. It was a grave threat to democracy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCOTUS-01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

Gov. Tim Walz and First Lady Gwen Walz were the first to pay their respects when the memorial opened to the public at noon. They were followed by Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, her husband and Senate Majority leader Erin Murphy.
Thousands of Minnesotans followed, many of them part of the Hortmans’ vast network of friends, family and colleagues.

Jennifer O’Rourke, director of government relations for Ramsey County, said her friendship with Melissa Hortman predates Hortman’s first election to the House in 2004.
“She deserves this,” O’Rourke said, gesturing to the line of Minnesotans wrapped around the block. Many brought flowers or letters to add to the memorial outside the House chambers, where extra tables were brought in to accommodate Friday’s contributions from the public. 
Others mourners had no connection to the Hortmans, but came in solidarity at a perilous moment in the history of the republic and its 32nd state.

Carla Peck, 69, took work off to attend the memorial alongside her 2-year-old golden retriever Ollie.
Peck didn’t know much about the Hortmans until they were killed, but she thought it important to attend.
“I wanted to show respect and appreciation for what the Hortmans did for the state of Minnesota. I thought it’s important to bring my golden because goldens are great to share the love. Dogs are very healing,” Peck said.
Dave Woosley, 65, drove over an hour from Hastings to the Capitol to pay his respects. He didn’t know Melissa Hortman, but he had heard of the extensive amount of work she was able to get done in the Legislature.
“I thought it was important for our fellow citizens to see that we can all come together, whether we agree with her or disagree with her. Just have respect for not only Melissa, but this institution,” Woosley said.

Jeff Kolstad, 79, met Hortman in passing while doorknocking and respected her work on the environment. Flowers in hand, he stood in line with his dog Gracie, who “wanted to pay a tribute to Gilbert.” 
A private funeral for the Hortmans will be held at 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed.

,DC,2025-06-27 20:29:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Congress unlikely to enact ‘absolutely devastating’ Trump proposal to slash Pell Grants,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-unlikely-enact-absolutely-devastating-trump-proposal-slash-pell-grants,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump wants to cut nearly $1,700 from the maximum Pell Grant award as part of his fiscal 2026 budget request — a move that would leave the subsidy for low-income students at its lowest level in more than a decade.The proposal would have a devastating effect on college affordability and drive up costs for states because they’d have to fill in the missing federal dollars, education advocates and experts say.The request — part of the president’s wish list for appropriations in fiscal 2026 — faces steep odds in Congress, where key members of both parties responded to the proposal with alarm.“I don’t want to cut the Pell Grant,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, told States Newsroom.“I’m concerned about that — I’m hoping that we’ll get that resolved,” she said.Opposition from Capito, whose panel writes the annual bill to fund the Education Department, makes Trump’s wish unlikely to make its way into the upcoming legislation.The Pell Grant is a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college and is the foundation of federal student aid in the United States.Catherine Brown, senior policy and advocacy director at the National College Attainment Network, said the cut would be “absolutely devastating,” noting that “college is already out of reach for millions upon millions of low-income students.”Funding gapThe Pell Grant program is seeing a projected budget shortfall of $2.7 billion heading into the next fiscal year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The administration has cited the shortfall as a reason to decrease the maximum award.The request calls for reducing the maximum Pell Grant for the 2026-2027 award year from $7,395 to $5,710. The last time the maximum award stood below this level was during the 2013-2014 award year, at $5,645. Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request includes $12 billion in total cuts to the Education Department as he and his administration seek to dismantle the agency and dramatically reshape the federal role in education.Democrats: Cut would be ‘crazy’Democrats have raised strong opposition, while even the Republican chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Education Department funding was noncommittal about pursuing Pell Grant cuts.“We want to make sure that (Pell Grants are) serving the people they need to,” Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama said when asked about any concerns he has on the proposed cut.Aderholt said he’s hearing “a lot” from his constituents about the proposed reduction, and that it’s “certainly something we’re going to look at.”Meanwhile, the leading Democrats on the House and Senate education spending panels were quick to blast the proposed cut.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the full House Appropriations Committee and the education spending subcommittee, called the nearly $1,700 reduction “crazy.”“People are not going to be able to do it, and that’s the tragedy of what they’re doing here is dismantling all of the constructs that are there to provide people particularly with public education and a pathway to success,” the Connecticut Democrat said.“You take away Federal Work-Study, you lower the Pell Grant, that says to me, you want to destroy public education,” DeLauro said.The budget request proposes slashing $980 million of Federal Work-Study funding and requiring employers to pay 75% of students’ hourly wages, with the government contributing 25%.The program gives part-time employment to students with financial need in order to help cover the cost of college. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, ranking member of the Senate subcommittee, said she “strongly” opposes the proposed reduction.The Wisconsin Democrat said she also recognizes that “there’s a looming shortfall in Pell funding that we need to address.”“I am hopeful that we’ll be able to work together to do that,” Baldwin said.Advocates, experts weigh inHigher education advocates and experts are also sounding the alarm on the proposed reduction, both over the harm to low-income students’ access to higher education and the impact on states and colleges.“This would just much further exacerbate that gap and drive millions of students out of pursuing post-secondary education or set them on a different path,” Brown, with the National College Attainment Network, said.Katharine Meyer, a governance studies fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, described the proposed decline as “truly unprecedented.”She added that when the Pell Grant is smaller, states have to spend more on higher education, creating a challenge for state officials potentially grappling with other cuts in federal support in the budget reconciliation package Republicans are scrambling to pass.“States don’t necessarily have the flexibility to spend more money when they have budgets that they need to balance, and they’re facing other federal constraints, including potentially having to take on additional health care costs depending on what happens with health care negotiations in budget reconciliation,” she said.Capito also said she thought a reduction to Pell Grants would ripple out to the state level.At the institutional level, Meyer pointed out that if a state has a smaller bucket to allocate for higher education but wants to prioritize financial aid, it would “come at the cost of” the money appropriated to universities.“Then institutions are not going to be able to spend as much on their operating funds,” she said. “They’re not going to be able to do capital improvement campaigns, which are often very necessary.”Ties to reconciliation billHouse Republicans have also proposed major changes to Pell Grant eligibility as part of GOP lawmakers’ separate “big, beautiful bill.” The legislative package would slash billions of dollars in federal programs to offset the cost of other parts of Trump’s agenda, including extending the 2017 tax cuts and boosting border security funding.GOP lawmakers are using the complex reconciliation process to move a package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber and avoid the Senate’s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship.The House narrowly passed its version of the reconciliation package in late May. That measure included a provision that would raise the minimum number of credit hours to qualify for the maximum Pell Grant award from 12 per semester to 15. The move would save $7.1 billion in federal spending over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.That new eligibility requirement is not included in the draft proposal for the reconciliation package that Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released in June.",,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)While the U.S. Senate has taken the front seat on discussing the GOP’s massive tax-and-spending bill, members of Congress’ lower chamber continue to weigh in on specific measures that could make passage through the U.S. House difficult.
Specifically, several U.S. Representatives have drawn a line against any provisions that would sell off federal public lands — a similar coalition that stripped a smaller land sale provision from the One Big Beautiful Bill during its first vetting by the House.
In a letter sent to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, five representatives, led by Montana western Rep. Ryan Zinke, called public land sales a “poison pill,” and if the bill returns to the House with a provision for selling federal land, the legislation will not pass muster.
“We support the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) passed by the House and generally accept changes to the bill that may be made by the Senate,” Thursday’s letter states. “However, we cannot accept the sale of federal lands that Senator Lee seeks. If a provision to sell public lands is in the bill that reaches the House floor, we will be forced to vote no.”
Republicans hold a slim eight-seat margin in the chamber — three Democratic representatives have died this year leaving vacancies — and if all Democrats were to oppose the bill, a five-representative block of Republicans voting against it would sink the reconciliation legislation, which needs a simple majority to pass.
When the bill first passed through the House, Zinke worked to strip out an amendment that proposed the sale of thousands of acres of federal land near urban areas in Nevada and Utah.
But once in the Senate, public land sales have become an even bigger debate after Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee introduced a new provision targeting the mandatory sale of between 2 million and 3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land. While federal land in Montana was exempt from the provision, it drew opposition from myriad outdoor recreation and conservation groups as well as from several Republican senators, including Montana’s Steve Daines and Idaho’s Jim Risch and Mike Crapo.
On Monday, the Senate parliamentarian — the nonpartisan advisor to the Senate who interprets rules — ruled that the public lands sale does not meet the requirements for inclusion in a reconciliation bill.
But within hours, Lee had stated he will work on smaller proposal targeting just BLM land within five miles of a population center, aimed at reducing housing costs in regions across the West, to be included in the legislative package.
In an interview with CNN that Zinke posted to the social media site X, formerly Twitter, he disagreed with the premise that vast swaths of public land should be sold to be used for affordable housing.
“Affordable housing is tens of acres, not millions of acres,” he said in the interview.
The letter sent by Zinke and representatives from Idaho, Oregon, Washington and California, said that there are “deep concerns” about Lee’s push to sell off public lands.
“This would be a grave mistake, unforced error and poison pill that will cause the bill to fail should it come to the House floor,” the letter states.
The elected officials all represent western states with vast tracts of federal land — 52% in Oregon, 46% in California and a whopping 80% in Montana’s western House district.
“We understand and agree with Senator Lee and our House colleagues that the federal government has mismanaged federal lands for decades, however, we do not agree with their solution. We believe advancing the House Republicans legislative agenda on public lands and natural resources, along with using existing law for land disposals, is the correct path forward,” the letter said.
The representatives say they hope the Senate parliamentarian will strip out any additional language about public lands sales from the bill.
Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Foundation, said the coalition of conservation groups he works with are continuing to provide a “positive stream of encouragement,” to Montana’s federal delegation urging them to keep up their record of opposition to public land sales.
“A threat to public land anywhere, is a threat to public land everywhere,” Szollosi told the Daily Montanan. “We’re all public land owners regardless of what state they’re in.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5418-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

The department launched NeverForgotten.ar.gov in 2016 in partnership with the state attorney general’s office. The database will now “automatically capture” a missing person report to the National Crime Information Center by local law enforcement agencies, according to the news release. The report will alert both the Arkansas State Police and the U.S. Marshals Service.
“These enhancements will help law enforcement respond more quickly, particularly in cases involving juveniles who may be at risk of being trafficked,” the news release states.
Real-time updates eliminate the previously existing lag in accurate information caused by weekly updates, according to the Department of Public Safety.
“These enhancements will improve the effectiveness of missing person investigations and public awareness campaigns, increasing the chances of safe recovery — particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and at-risk adults,” ACIC Deputy Director Rick Stallings said in the release.
Arkansas has more than 400 unsolved cases of missing persons between 1 and 91 years old. A case from 30 years ago, the abduction of 6-year-old Morgan Nick of Alma, remained “active and ongoing” as of October, when the Alma Police Department announced it had uncovered new DNA evidence linking Nick to her suspected kidnapper, who died in prison in 1996.
The Morgan Nick Foundation, a missing children’s advocacy group founded by Nick’s mother, is one of the groups that actively supports the Arkansas Department of Public Safety’s efforts to solve missing persons cases, according to Friday’s news release.

Both faced a jury trial in Saginaw County Circuit Court. Following deliberations, the jury convicted Eggleston and Lamar-Silvia on one count of conspiracy to do a legal act in an illegal manner and one count of election law forgery, both five-year felonies. 
Eggleston was additionally convicted of a 93-day misdemeanor for signing a nominating petition as a circulator, even though he was a candidate for office.
Lamar-Silvia was also convicted on one count of signing multiple different names on a nominating petition, a five-year felony, and one count of signing a nominating petition with a name other than her own, a 93-day misdemeanor.
The Michigan Department of Attorney General alleged that Lamar-Silvia fraudulently signed the names of Saginaw voters to help get Eggleston on the ballot in 2024. It was also alleged that Eggleston signed a form falsely saying he was a petition circulator. He then submitted the documents to the Saginaw County Clerk’s office.
“Forging signatures on nominating petitions undermines our democratic process,” Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. “I am pleased the jury recognized the seriousness of these offenses. These convictions serve as a strong reminder that no one is above the law, and my office remains committed to upholding our election laws to protect the will of voters.”
Eggleston and Lamar-Silvia are to be sentenced in August before Saginaw County Circuit Court Judge Andre Borrello.

(Screenshot)OKLAHOMA CITY — Cuts to Medicaid being considered by Congress will affect access to health care for “all Oklahomans” and harm the state economy, state hospital leaders warned Friday. 
Members of the Oklahoma Hospital Association said the proposed federal cuts to Medicaid could eliminate nearly 15,000 jobs and over the next decade reduce federal reimbursements to Oklahoma hospitals by $8.7 billion. 
“This is happening at such a breakneck speed,” said Denise Webber, president and CEO of Stillwater Medical. “There’s not ample time to plan and create a strategy that can serve Oklahomans and U.S. citizens in a manner that we can plan for.”
Cuts to Medicaid as part of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” are being considered in the U.S. Senate as part of Congress’ budget reconciliation process. The bill passed through the House, but has faced resistance in the Senate due in part to concerns about its expected negative impact on rural hospitals. Also the chamber’s parliamentarian ruled several proposed Medicaid changes can’t proceed. Senate leaders hope to vote on the bill before July 4. 
Webber said the proposed Medicaid cuts are unlike anything she’s seen in modern history. She chairs the Oklahoma Hospital Association board. “Big cuts” will have to be made for hospitals to be able to provide some services, she said. The Oklahoma Hospital Association advocates at state and federal levels on behalf of hospitals and works to promote health policy issues. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIf cuts are made because hospitals can no longer afford staff, it doesn’t only affect Medicaid patients but all Oklahomans seeking care, Webber said. 
“If we don’t have enough nurses and hospital beds and we have to put in (patient) caps, that can mean that you’ll be held kind of in a limbo land, waiting for a hospital bed,” Webber said. “And then what potentially happens, because this is happening statewide and nationwide, is we may not even understand, because I don’t believe we do, how bad that could get.”
The most expensive services, like oncology and neonatal, are likely to be cut first, she said. 
Rich Rasmussen, president and CEO of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said the hospital group has spent time in D.C. advocating directly to Oklahoma’s congressional delegation and their staff, warning them of the potential effects of these cuts. 
If the bill were to pass and immediately affect the existing reimbursement models beginning this summer and fall, hospital boards will need to “wrestle” with the reductions, he said. 
“I think it’s something that nobody looks forward to,” Rasmussen said. “So hopefully our senators will stand in the gap for us and ensure that we aren’t hit with these types of cuts.”
Ten hospitals in Oklahoma have closed since 2005, he said. But more hospital closures, especially in rural Oklahoma, could be looming if the Senate approves the Medicaid cuts. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stilwell Hospital announced its closure this month, raising concerns about rural health care access.
Rural Oklahomans are already faced with worse health care outcomes and provider deserts, but these will be exacerbated by Medicaid cuts, said Trent Bourland, vice president of rural development for SSM Health Oklahoma. 
“The lack of analytical depth in evaluating the full effect on the rural providers represents a serious oversight in responsible governments,” he said. “Our rural communities are the backbone of our nation. They deserve policy decisions guided by solid data, practical foresight and respect for the role in what rural America does for sustaining America’s strength and stability.”
People in rural areas will have to travel further for care, especially OB-GYN care, Bourland said. 
In the 15 most Northwest Oklahoma counties, obstetrics care would most likely be eliminated, he said. This would force people to drive over 40 miles for routine care and up to 80 miles for specialty care, Bourland said, but only if other regional hospitals are still able to provide those services. 
Jay Johnson, president and CEO of DRH Health in Duncan, said the hospital will have to put a hold on its efforts to expand OB-GYN and mental health care and potentially eliminate travel nurse contracts. 
“We’ll often get into these conversations of rural and urban, but there’s not much of a rural and urban in health care anymore because we’re all in this together,” Johnson said. “And that’s what it takes to provide care for our patients throughout our state.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-27-at-12.50.43 PM-e1751053587458-1024x791.png,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

Kelly Ayotte signed New Hampshire’s two budget bills — House Bill 1 and House Bill 2 — into law Friday, approving a $15.9 billion two-year package to fund the state government until July 2027.
The governor also signed a third compromise bill, House Bill 282, meant to address her concerns over education funding and changes to the retirement system, and to head off her threats of a veto.
The signatures mark a political victory for the governor, when the outcome was hardly certain. Just one week after House and Senate negotiators made reductions to health care spending, education aid to Manchester school districts, and a proposed fix to police and firefighter retirement benefits championed by Ayotte, the governor had vowed to veto the budget without changes. 
That pledge kicked off days of negotiations that culminated in a last-minute deal Wednesday evening that Ayotte endorsed. But a faction of fiscally conservative House Republicans who objected to spending increases nearly derailed the process, joining with Democrats to briefly defeat HB 1 on Thursday before the vote was reconsidered and the bill was passed.
In the end, after months of sharp disagreements among the Republican governor, the House, and the Senate over how much the state could afford, Ayotte emerged with a budget that kept much of the funding she proposed in February. 
The final package signed Friday restored many of the cuts made to Ayotte’s budget by the House, which took a more conservative approach. Some boards and agencies that had been eliminated by the House, like the Office of the Child Advocate, the Commission for Human Rights, and the Housing Appeals Board, were restored in the budget, albeit with some changes and cuts. The budget also includes some policies championed by Ayotte, such as a “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban in public schools and a new requirement that state agencies turn around housing development applications in 60 days. 
But the final spending package also adds cuts to the University System of New Hampshire not favored by Ayotte, and does not include the high revenue projections as Ayotte’s budget did. And it inserted a series of “back-of-the budget” cuts to agencies, such as a $51 million cut to the Department of Health and Human Services, that will require commissioners to reduce programs and potentially eliminate positions. 
Republicans broadly praised the budget for keeping spending increases within inflation, allowing education freedom accounts to apply to all income levels, and including some policy priorities such as the end of the state vehicle inspections beginning January 2026.
Democrats, meanwhile, decried the budget’s cuts to DHHS spending and its creation of a new premium added to Medicaid plans for participants, and said the budget underfunds efforts to improve housing affordability, child care, and public education.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ayotteinaugural-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

There will be Michiganders that don’t survive the cuts if Congress passes the plan, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, General Motors employee and United Autos Worker member Jean Duchemin said during the event on the Capitol lawn.
In total, the legislation, which has already been voted through by the U.S. House and now awaits the U.S. Senate’s approval, would cut Medicaid funding by more than $800 billion and cut about $290 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
The GOP bill seeks to extend the 2017 tax cuts made during Trump’s first term, as well as vastly shrink the size of the federal government through major spending reductions.

Duchemin said while Trump’s plan looks to line the pockets of the billionaire class while breaking the middle class, the working class has power too, noting the UAW’s track record of fighting for better wages. In 2023, the UAW led a successful strike against Detroit’s “Big Three” automakers in order to secure better benefits and pay for autoworkers.
“This is class warfare…It always has been class warfare. It’s an attack on the poor, it’s an attack on the middle class, and its attack on the working class. So when you see a protest, when you see a gathering fighting for these rights, join them. If you have a voice, use it,” Duchemin said. “Keep shaking the foundations of these billionaires’ mansions, because they are afraid of us. They are terrified of us.”

Lansing was the latest stop for the “Stop the Billionaire Giveaway” Bus Tour, led by Fair Share America, where for the next few weeks advocates against the spending plan are traveling with a green bus to different states to call for an end to the Republican plan.
The budget bill has made progress to becoming law, but it isn’t too late to fight against it, Executive Director of Fair Share America Kristen Crowell said. And as the Senate makes changes to the bill, she said it will have to go through the House again.
A recent ruling by the Senate parliamentarian has complicated GOP plans to move the legislation to a floor vote. 
Regardless, Crowell said hardworking people often find themselves on the cusp of poverty, and all it takes is one bill to send a family into catastrophe.
“One dental bill sent my family into a downward spiral that felt impossible to recover from. First, my lights were turned off and the electricity was shut. Then they repossessed my car, and ultimately I lost my home to foreclosure,” Crowell said. “The fear that this puts on a family and on children, is unthinkable, but there’s also great shame in not being able to take care of our families and take care of our loved ones.”

There’s a misconception that only certain types of people rely on Medicaid, and if Michiganders are under the impression that no one they know is on Medicaid, they are mistaken, Steve Lawson, executive director for Michigan Families for Fair Care said during the Friday event.
There are about 2.6 million Michiganders who are enrolled in Medicaid, about a quarter of the state’s population, according to the state health department. Meanwhile, about 15% of Michigan’s population, nearly 1.5 million residents, rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the Michigan State Budget Office.
“Michigan is a middle class state. We work hard here. We look out for our neighbors. We’re proud of where we came from. We always think about the people who are doing less well than we are,” Lawson said. “Cutting Medicaid to pay for tax breaks for billionaires are not Michigan values.”

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Lee’s Montana newspapers include The Billings Gazette, Missoulian, the Montana Standard, Helena Independent Record and the Ravalli Republic.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
  Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case 

It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Failed contract negotiations between Brown University Health and UnitedHealthcare mean that thousands of seniors and disabled residents will no longer be covered for non-emergency visits at four Rhode Island hospitals starting July 1.
Fallout from the closed-door dispute has spilled over into public communications, creating uncertainty for United Medicare Advantage plan participants over whether they can keep seeing Brown Health hospital physicians at the same cost even after the contract expires on Monday, June 30.
Brown Health on a webpage dedicated to the contract issue states that its hospitals — Rhode Island Hospital, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Newport Hospital — will be considered “out of network” for United Medicare Advantage patients. This would suggest that affected plan participants will have to pay out of pocket to keep seeing their same doctors, or even lose the chance to continue receiving non-emergency services.
But United on its own webpage calls out Brown Health for “inaccurate information” regarding the timing of loss of coverage. According to the health insurer, Brown Health physicians will remain “in network” for Medicare Advantage patients on, and after July 1.
Jessica Wharton, a spokesperson for Brown Health, clarified in an emailed response Friday that hospital physicians will continue to participate in United’s Medicare Advantage plan through June 2026. However, out-of-pocket costs may rise for patients no longer in the network, depending on their plans, she said. 
Amid confusion and a flood of questions to his office, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has stepped in with a webpage of his own. 
“Any sudden change in health insurance coverage can cause consumers to panic, and rightfully so,” Neronha said in a statement. “Affordable, accessible health care is foundational to our quality of life, and we hope this resource equips Rhode Islanders with the information they need, should they need it.”
Information on the number of inquiries from affected patients to Neronha’s office was not immediately available.
The AG’s website also addresses the question of whether UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage patients can keep seeing their Brown Health hospital doctors after July 1.
The answer, per the AG’s website: “It depends on your plan and your particular medical needs. You may need to pay more for care at Brown University Health hospitals if a contract is not agreed to, but you may still have some coverage for care provided at these facilities.”
The AG website refers readers to UnitedHealthcare’s website and phone number for more information on what’s covered under their individual insurance plans.

Negotiations break down over payments 
Confusion over when coverage ends for affected participants tracks with the conflicting narratives each side gives. As United tells it, the hospital network made a “good-faith effort,” to agree on new contract terms with Brown Health ahead of the June 30 expiration.
“Unfortunately, Brown University Health refused our proposal to extend our contract through the end of 2025 and is seeking to be paid significantly more than any health system in our Medicare Advantage network in Rhode Island,” the company states on its website. 
United also said it offered to extend the existing Medicare Advantage contract through the end of 2025 as a stopgap until a longer-term agreement was worked out. Brown Health refused, “potentially and unnecessarily disrupting access to care for thousands of people enrolled in our Medicare Advantage plans,” the company states on its website.
Cole Manbeck, a spokesperson for United, did not directly answer questions about the miscommunication or how many plan participants will lose coverage at Brown Health hospitals. 
“While we remain open to discussions with Brown University Health, our focus at this time is providing people access to the care they need through continuity of care or a smooth transition to another provider, as appropriate,” Manbeck said in an emailed statement Friday. 
Brown Health maintains that the decision not to renew the contract was “mutual.” The hospital system said it wanted “fair reimbursement” and “less administrative burden for patients.”
Wharton pointed out that United offers higher reimbursements for the hospital network at its two Massachusetts hospitals than in Rhode Island, echoing the well-documented problem of the Ocean State’s uncompetitive reimbursement rates. The contract dispute does not apply to Brown Health’s Morton Hospital in Taunton or St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River.
Federally reported data estimates 129,000 Rhode Islanders are enrolled in Medicare Advantage health insurance plans available for people 65 and older, or with disabilities or chronic conditions like end-stage kidney failure or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.) The commercial alternative to government-run traditional Medicare has grown in popularity nationwide and in Rhode Island with the promise of additional benefits and cost savings to participants. Participation in United’s Medicare Advantage program in Rhode Island grew 10.1% in 2023, according to the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner’s (OHIC) 2025 annual report.
But, private providers have faced increased scrutiny for inflating testing and diagnostics as a means to increase their bottom lines. 
Research by the Center for Advancing Health Policy Through Research at the Brown University School of Public Health suggests Medicare Advantage plans are projected to receive $30 billion in additional payments this year as a result of “differential coding intensity” compared with traditional, government-run Medicare plans.
UnitedHealth Group Inc, the parent company for the insurer’s individual state plans, topped the list of private insurers raking in money through inflated risk assessments, spending an extra $11.6 million across its 6.9 million plan participants nationwide in 2025, according to the analysis, which is based on 2021 Medicare data adjusted to 2025 dollars. In Rhode Island, the insurer is projected to spend an extra $47 million due to higher risk assessments of its 37,000 plan participants this year, or $105 more per patient, on average. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which covers nearly twice the number of Medicare Advantage patients in the state as United, was projected to spend an extra $1 more per patient compared with traditional Medicare plan spending.
Both private insurers’ Medicare Advantage plans exceeded the state’s 6% cost growth target in 2023, with Blue Cross reporting 7.1% increase in total spending, while United’s total costs rose 14.8%, according to OHIC’s annual report. 
The end to the contract between Brown Health and United does not affect dual Medicare and Medicaid recipients. There are also assurances for continuity of care in certain cases, including patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed cancer, or those in active cancer treatment. United Medicare Advantage plan participants whose insurance is covered through a former employer under a group plan may also continue to receive care at Brown University hospitals.

The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County, Maryland, parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)State lawmakers this week emphasized to court officials that New Mexico’s behavioral health overhaul must not result in pulling more people into the criminal legal system.
New Mexico this year enacted two pieces of legislation intended to rebuild the system for delivering mental health treatment in the state after former Gov. Susana Martinez dismantled it more than a decade ago.
The new laws’ intent includes allowing local communities, including governments and non-governmental organizations, to organize into “behavioral health regions;” determine what services and supports they need; and then present those priorities to the newly created Behavioral Health Reform Executive Committee for approval and funding.
At its first meeting on Tuesday, the Executive Committee voted to establish the regions, Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) Director Karl Reifsteck said at the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee meeting on Wednesday.
AOC Behavioral Health Integration and Reform Administrator Esperanza Lucero told the committee that the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is helping AOC with Sequential Intercept Mapping, which is a commonly used conceptual model that maps out “intercept” points where people with mental health or substance use disorders can receive treatment and support.
When Reifsteck and Lucero presented an example of what the model could look like on Wednesday, lawmakers questioned them about why so much of it is focused on police, courts, jail and prison.
Members of the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee from both political parties on Wednesday told AOC officials they intended the behavioral health treatment reforms to benefit all people with mental health diagnoses, not just people who come into contact with police or the courts.
LHHS Committee Chair Liz Thomson, a Democratic representative from Albuquerque, said concerns have been raised to her about the new system having “a criminal basis, as opposed to just behavioral health.” She asked if AOC has figured out how to implement the new law without relying on the criminal legal system.
Lucero pointed to the first step in the model that calls for a “crisis line,” which generally refers to phone lines that offer free counseling for people dealing with emotional, mental or substance use issues. The state Health Care Authority’s 988 NM Lifeline offers support via phone, text, live chat or video call.
However, Thomson and other lawmakers on the committee said people need access to more than just a helpline when they start seeking help, before police, prosecutors and judges get involved.
“We want treatment before there’s a crisis,” Thomson said. “I’m bringing it out because I’m part of the disability community and it’s a concern, and we really, really don’t want the public to come away with the impression that a behavioral health disorder issue is criminal.”
Sen. Jay Block, a Rio Rancho Republican, said the law’s intent “is not judicial or criminal by any means.”
“We have an epidemic in this country of some behavioral health issues — especially in this state — and the intent of this is to provide empirical data to allow us to understand where we need to focus our resources, where we need to invest more resources or pull back resources to get these people the help that they need,” Block said.
AOC Deputy Director Sarah Jacobs said her agency is working with UNM’s Health Sciences Center on a model that would involve less interaction with the criminal legal system.
Reifsteck said the new law gives the behavioral health regions and local stakeholders the power to determine their local priorities. “It’s not going to be the courts deciding on what the priorities are,” he said.
Thomson asked if the Executive Committee has veto power in the event one of the regions submits a plan “that’s all about hardened criminals, with nothing for families, nothing for infants and children.”
“Is there some sort of oversight saying, ‘Whoa, this isn’t quite what we had in mind’?” she asked.
Reifsteck said yes, because the new law explicitly makes the Executive Committee responsible for reviewing and approving the plans.
“So I would anticipate that if a region came in and set a plan, and it was purely criminal justice focused, the seven members would say, ‘Hold on, why are these the top priorities for your region’?” he said. “Maybe that’s what is possible right now, or something, for that region, but it’s hard to imagine that those are the only ones.”
Lucero said the Executive Committee expects the local regions to submit plans by July 2026.
The Executive Committee’s next meeting is scheduled for Aug. 5, at which time Reifsteck said he hopes to see a rubric or initial thoughts from the Health Care Authority about how the regions should be organized.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned a controversial earlier decision that had sent alarm through the ski industry in Idaho and nationwide, holding instead that a lower court was right to dismiss a lawsuit from the widow of a skier who died after crashing into a snowmaking tower gun at Sun Valley.
Supreme Court case shakes Idaho ski areas by overturning decades of liability precedent

However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed.

“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.”
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.
Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident
Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions.
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say
The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments to reconsider ruling on ski area liability law

Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails.
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas.
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling:

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others.
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.
In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas.
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

(Courtesy of the University of Virginia)In a stunning development that’s igniting fierce political backlash, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan resigned Friday under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which alleged the school had failed to fully dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs — a demand tied to a sweeping federal crackdown on higher education.
The New York Times first reported Ryan’s resignation, citing DOJ claims that the institution had merely rebranded its DEI efforts instead of eliminating them. The university’s Board of Visitors accepted his resignation, with Ryan expected to officially step down by Aug. 15 after becoming the president in 2018. He has not commented publicly.
The move has sparked outrage on campus and across Virginia. A protest led by Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, is scheduled at the Rotunda on Friday.
“This unprecedented political interference threatens the independence of our University and its fundamental values,” a letter from the chairs of Wahoos4UVA Advisory Council states. 
“Whatever reason the Department of Justice gives for taking this action is only a pretext thinly masking a partisan agenda. What’s happening is clear: the Trump administration has made UVA the next target in its escalating attack on higher education in America.”
UVA became the first public university in Virginia to dissolve its DEI office on March 8 after President Donald Trump’s executive order warned of t federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
Opponents of DEI argue hiring and promotions should be merit-based rather than consider race or gender. Supporters say DEI efforts are vital to addressing systematic inequities that have long blocked opportunities for women and people of color and women.
The school has also been under scrutiny for its handling of antisemitism complaints. UVA was among 60 colleges flagged in a federal inquiry over whether it adequately protected Jewish students, prompting additional concerns over potential funding losses.
Virginia Senate Democrats condemned what they called federal overreach, urging university boards to “resist any efforts by the Trump Admin to dictate how Virginia runs its own taxpayer-funded schools.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “UVA is the envy of American public universities,” and called Ryan an “incredible leader.” He added: “Trump’s interference in the operation of Virginia’s universities and any cooperation by those sworn to protect them will not be tolerated by the Virginia Senate.”
U.S. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also blasted the DOJ’s involvement, underscoring that Virginia’s economy and prosperity depend on the strength and integrity of the state’s higher education system. 
“It is outrageous that officials in the Trump Department of Justice demanded the commonwealth’s globally recognized university remove President Ryan — a strong leader who has served UVA honorably and moved the university forward — over ridiculous ‘culture war’ traps,” the senators stated. 
“Decisions about UVA’s leadership belong solely to its Board of Visitors, in keeping with Virginia’s well-established and respected system of higher education governance. This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future.”
The UVA Board of Visitors last met June 4-6. Its next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 11-12.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)With the U.S. Senate poised to vote on a budget reconciliation bill that, among other impacts, will slash health care for thousands of Mainers, advocates are putting pressure on Republican Sen. Susan Collins to buck her caucus and vote against the plan.
GOP leaders have set a deadline of July 4 for passage and the Senate is expected to vote on the bill over the weekend.
For the past two weeks, health care advocates in Maine and beyond have been calling on Collins to reject the bill, which proposes significant cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other programs in order to continue tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. 
Almost 400,000 Maine residents — a third of the state’s population — currently rely on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. The nonpartisan budget office estimates as many as 50,000 Mainers could lose health coverage by 2034, either under Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, while the restrictions in funding will further increase the strain on rural hospitals.
“As the chair of the Appropriations Committee and the seventh most senior U.S. senator, Sen. Susan Collins holds immense power. But she’s not using it to publicly stand against the reconciliation bill,” said Nora Flaherty-Stanford, communications director for the Maine People’s Alliance, which held protests earlier this month outside Collins’ offices in Bangor, Lewiston and Portland. “If this bill moves forward in its current form, it will badly hurt Mainers and people around the country.”
On Thursday, Gov. Janet Mills sent a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation, urging them to vote against the bill. Citing an independent estimate that found Maine could lose $4.5 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade, Mills warned that Maine can’t bear the financial burden the health care and other cuts would impose on the state. 
Both Democratic Reps. Jared Golden and Chellie Pingree voted against the reconciliation bill when the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version last month. If the Senate passes its version, the bill will go back to the House to vote on those changes. 
On Monday, independent Sen. Angus King led a group of former governors in sending a letter to Republican leadership highlighting their concerns with how the proposal will impact state budgets. In a press conference Wednesday, King called the bill “the worst, most regressive and most harmful piece of legislation I have ever seen.” 
Collins has not publicly said how she plans to vote on the reconciliation bill and her office did not respond to requests for comment.
During Senate negotiations, Collins described some of the proposed cuts to Medicaid as “problematic,” but has said she supports adding work requirements to the health program. 
The work requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill. Flaherty-Stanford and other advocates say the paperwork mandates will cause eligible people to lose care.
“Most of the people who will lose their coverage won’t lose it because they aren’t eligible,” Flaherty-Stanford said. “They’ll lose it by getting buried under mountains of red tape and relentless bureaucratic requirements.”

Health professionals argue against Medicaid cuts
Senate Republicans can only lose three of their members and still pass the bill. With such a small margin for success, Trump has been pressuring those who have been critical of the proposal to get on board. “We don’t want to have grandstanders,” Trump said Thursday. “Not good people. They know who I’m talking about.”
During a press conference Friday, State Rep. Anne Graham (D-North Yarmouth) and Protect Our Care Maine Director Toby McGrath acknowledged that pressure coming from the White House but called on Collins to do what is best for Maine.
“I just want Susan Collins to listen to her constituents and stand up for her constituents and not be bullied by the Republican majority or the administration,” said Graham, a retired pediatric nurse practitioner. “One of the things that she’s always been proud of is representing the northern part of Maine, the rural parts of Maine. Those are the people who are going to suffer the most, I believe, if these cuts happen.”
In Maine, 24.1% of people in rural areas or small towns rely on Medicaid, compared with 20% of people in metro areas, according to a study by Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. The state also has the 11th highest rate of Medicaid coverage for adults aged 19 to 64 in rural areas in the country, including people with disabilities, and the 9th highest rate of coverage for seniors.
Dr. Christine Mahoney, a physician from Brunswick, joined more than 4,000 doctors nationwide in signing a letter organized by the Committee to Protect Health Care urging senators to vote against the bill. 
“I see firsthand how access to health care improves health and saves lives, and for many, many Mainers, Medicaid is that lifeline,” Mahoney said during a separate press event earlier this week.
Without Medicaid, prevention and management of chronic conditions and maternal care would be severely threatened, she said. She noted that without coverage, patients often delay medical treatment, leading to late-stage preventable diseases and potentially forcing difficult choices between health care and financial survival.
Mahoney also highlighted broader community impacts, including potential hospital closures and economic disruption, particularly in rural areas. 
If Maine’s members of Congress vote in favor of the bill, “the message it sends to me and a lot of Mainers would be that our senators don’t care. That they don’t care about them, they don’t care about their futures, they don’t care about their health and livelihood,” Mahoney added.
Family planning providers warn about ‘backdoor abortion ban’
Maine’s family planning providers, Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, echoed the calls for senators to vote against the bill during a press event on Tuesday.
One provision of the bill still being weighed by the Senate parliamentarian, which determines whether the bill adheres to the complex rules of the reconciliation process, would bar Medicaid reimbursements to organizations that provide abortions and receive more than $1 million in federal funds.
Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, described the budget reconciliation bill as “a backdoor abortion ban.”
“Every single day we are having to navigate a new policy or push from the federal government, something that’s being taken away, all in an attempt to put us out of business, to stop us from providing abortion,” she said. 
In May, Planned Parenthood released a memo pointing to Collins’ long history of supporting the organization. “Throughout her career, Sen. Collins has made it clear that she understands how critical Medicaid is to her constituents and all Americans’ ability to access essential health care,” it read. “She knows that cuts to the program will harm Mainers.”
Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, told the Maine Morning Star that it’s clear the bill will hurt Maine, and “we are counting on our congressional delegation to do everything they can to stop it from getting to President Trump’s desk.”

Connecticut’s Democratic congressional delegation wasn’t so sure.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, for example, claimed Trump was “deliberately misleading the public” when he said Iran’s nuclear program was “completely and totally obliterated.” Murphy believes the attack only set it back “by a handful of months” and not years if Iran still possesses enriched uranium.
“There’s no doubt there was damage done to the program, but the allegations that we have obliterated their program just don’t seem to stand up to reason,” Murphy told reporters Thursday at the U.S. Capitol. “I can’t share any of the details from this briefing, but I just do not think the president was telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated.”
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said it was too early to tell the extent of the damage and believes Iran is still a threat. But he agreed with Murphy to an extent that descriptions appeared “to exaggerate the amount of damage and how long it would take to rebuild.”
Both senators hope for a diplomatic solution but said that depends on the administration’s next steps. 
The two delayed classified briefings at the U.S. Capitol — one before the Senate on Thursday, one before the House today — highlighted the latest tensions between the parties over the strikes in Iran as well as how they view their roles in approving military action.
The Trump administration has strongly defended the strikes. At a briefing from the Pentagon on Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called it a “resounding success.” He lashed out at the press over stories on a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report that concluded core components of the nuclear component — like some of the centrifuges that enrich uranium — remain intact and the strikes only set it back a few months.
“Because you cheer against Trump so hard, in your DNA and in your blood, cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad, you have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon briefing. “You have to hope maybe they weren’t effective.”

Republicans were largely in agreement with Trump’s assessment of obliteration. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said he believed the strikes caused “catastrophic damage.”
As he left the highly secure room where the briefing was held, Blumenthal told reporters he was “hopeful we did as much damage as possible” and called the mission “successful insofar extensively damaged and set back the Iranian arms program.” But he cautioned that he wants to wait and see what final reports indicate.
“We have a lot of spin, a lot of narrative that seems to exaggerate the amount of damage and how long it would take to rebuild, and that’s dangerous because it creates a false sense of security,” Blumenthal said in an interview after Thursday’s briefing. “I came away from that briefing without a lot of comfort that we have completely and finally stopped a nuclear-armed Iran.”
“The point is we don’t know. Anybody who says we know a certain thing is making it up because we have no final battle damage assessment,” he told reporters at another point after the briefing.
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said there has been a lot of recent discussion over “what’s the right adjective” to describe the strikes.
Courtney commended U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, for his questions during Friday’s House briefing, adding it was “helpful to get the discussion off of political messaging and into the meat of the issues.” Himes serves as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and had voiced concerns about not getting advance notice about the strikes, given the role of the committee on intelligence matters.
Courtney said he he got some information but some questions still remain. For the eastern Connecticut congressman, his biggest focus is on the end game and force protection.
But he described Friday’s briefing as well-attended and said lawmakers in both parties were listening: “You could have heard a pin drop.”
“There was no question that both the Air Force and the submarine force executed the mission with great impact,” Courtney said, noting the Ohio-class submarine built in Groton that launched Tomahawk missiles into Iran. “But there’s definitely going to be more meat on the bone in terms of follow-up analysis and also diplomacy.”
The briefings were initially planned for earlier in the week but were postponed, to the frustration of the delegation. Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine attended the briefings.
But Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was notably absent. She testified in March that the U.S. intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.” Murphy said he wanted to know why she wasn’t in the room for a classified intelligence briefing.
Democrats and a handful of Republicans were frustrated that the administration didn’t seek approval or input from Congress before the bombings. Republicans and the administration believe Trump had the authority to authorize the strike on his own. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pointed to presidents in both parties who have relied on Article II of the Constitution as giving them that authority to do so as the commander-in-chief.
In response, Democrats have been pushing for votes on war powers resolutions to reassert their congressional authority on military action. One from U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is scheduled for a vote later on Friday.
Himes has his own resolution, which he introduced alongside other national security leaders U.S. Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Adam Smith, D-Wash. It is similar to another war powers resolution in the House but has a key distinction: It directs Trump to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran “other than those elements of the Armed Forces that may be necessary to defend the United States or an ally or partner of the United States from imminent attack provided.”
The Constitution grants the legislative branch the ability to “declare war.” The War Powers Act of 1973 requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action if there is no declaration of war.
Johnson has been critical of war powers resolutions, saying that it “is not a time for politics” and has called the War Powers Act “unconstitutional.”
As they await more answers on the strikes and push for additional briefings, Connecticut lawmakers are hoping to see the president engage in a diplomatic agreement to stabilizing the region, particularly as there’s a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. 
“The only path forward is diplomacy,” Murphy said, with a caveat. “I just have not heard a realistic path from this administration about diplomacy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25173450855675-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 16:06:37.190861

Indiana’s law has been in effect but a judge had stayed an ongoing lawsuit until the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling in the Texas lawsuit. On Friday, the court sided with Texas in a 6-3 vote along ideological lines. 
Attorney general, adult websites clash in age verification lawsuit

“(The Texas law) simply requires proof of age to access content that is obscene to minors, it does not directly regulate adults’ protected speech,” ruled the majority. “… adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification. Any burden on adults is therefore incidental to regulating activity not protected by the First Amendment.”
The court similarly dismissed arguments from adult content creators urging states to adopt less restrictive requirements, with the justices saying that isn’t required. 
While all agreed that states have an interest in protecting children from explicit material, dissenting justices said that “… adults have a constitutional right to view the very same speech that a State may prohibit for children.” 
Friday’s ruling was a departure from precedent, the dissenting justices argued, pointing to the option for less-restrictive laws. 
“… a State cannot target that expressions, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children,” the dissent said.
 Indiana background

Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act 17 passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority that would require the adult pornography sites to verify user ages early in the 2024 session. Prior to the law taking effect in July, a federal judge blocked its enforcement — only for an appeals court to roll back the preliminary injunction in August. 
The plaintiffs include the Free Speech Coalition and 11 adult content companies, including major provider Pornhub. 
Pornhub has blocked access to the site in Indiana since the law went into effect.
Free speech advocates, including those with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, argued that the barrier would make it harder for adult Hoosiers to access the content, which is their protected right under law. 
“The First Amendment doesn’t just protect a speaker, but also those who want to hear what someone is saying,” wrote Chris Daley, the ACLU’s Indiana executive director. “And in the case of constitutional protections, ‘speech’ is interpreted broadly to include video productions, including pornography.” 
Bill author Sen. Mike Bohacek pushed for the bill, saying, “We have children who have seen hardcore content before they have their first kiss.”
The Michiana Shores Republican followed up the bill with another effort to limit social media access for children under the age of 16, but it died in the House after passing the Senate.

Mitch McConnell told his colleagues behind closed doors this week that “failure is not an option” when it comes to passing their bill to deeply cut health, nutrition and education programs to fund tax cuts skewed to the wealthy. “I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid,” he told fellow senators. “But they’ll get over it.”
“Getting over it” will be hard in Kentucky, where the budget reconciliation bill is estimated to take health care from over 200,000 Kentuckians. Crucially, it also puts 35 rural Kentucky hospitals at risk of closure, more than any other state and 10% of the vulnerable hospitals across the entire country. These facilities depend heavily on the payments from Medicaid-covered patients to make emergency and specialty care available to everyone in the community.
Among the Kentucky hospitals that could shutter are five of the seven original Miners’ Memorial Hospitals set up by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1956. Those facilities — in Whitesburg, Middlesboro, Harlan, South Williamson and McDowell — are on the chopping block, along with Eastern Kentucky hospitals in Prestonsburg, Manchester, Louisa, Corbin, Mt. Sterling, Pineville, Irvine, Martin and Barbourville.
Coal mining has always been dangerous, but before the UMWA the work was brutal. Deaths and injuries were frequent, children worked in the mines, and pay was in the form of credit at the company store. It took often-bloody battles for the workers to win their union and a chance at a better life.
The UMWA Welfare and Retirement Fund, created through successful contract victories, built the Miners’ Memorial Hospitals to provide health care in coal communities where it was sorely lacking. But mechanization of coal mining led to deep job losses by the 1960s, and the UMWA was forced to sell the facilities to a nonprofit that eventually became Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH).
ARH and other Eastern Kentucky hospitals continue to provide everything from birthing to cancer care, and offer surgery, cardiology, physical and occupational therapy and family medicine. Rural people already travel much farther than others for health care and driving even longer distances due to shuttered hospitals will mean missed appointments and delayed treatment. That’s the difference between good health and bad, and between life and death.
The Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina reports that 196 rural hospitals have closed or converted since 2005, but Kentucky has been largely spared thanks to the funds provided by Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky lost four rural hospitals over those 20 years, while neighboring Tennessee — which did not expand Medicaid — lost 15.
ARH is the single largest employer in southeastern Kentucky, making potential Medicaid cuts a jobs issue as well. Health care and social assistance is the biggest industry in the Eastern Kentucky workforce area, employing 26,585 people or 25% of all jobs. And many other jobs in the region, like in retail (16,580 jobs) and government (23,192), depend on the spending and taxes of these hospitals’ nurses, therapists, physicians, technicians and more.
The threat to rural hospitals from proposed Medicaid cuts is a major point of contention over the bill. Some are floating the Band-Aid of a “rural hospital fund” that will only address a tiny fraction of the problem and is more a talking point than a solution.
Eastern Kentucky miners fought and died to create a health care system in a region where the market never would have on its own. Now members of Congress threaten to take it away.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A Friday decision by the U.S. Supreme Court set the stage for a law restricting access to online pornography to take effect Tuesday in South Dakota, but the ruling doesn’t shield the state from lawsuits.
In Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the nation’s high court ruled that a Texas law requiring adults to prove their age to access adult-oriented websites is constitutional.
Under the Texas law, websites where one-third or more of the content is pornographic would have to collect information like photo identification or credit card information before allowing access.
The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment industry group, argued the law placed an unconstitutional burden on adults.
Governor signs age verification bill and lab-grown meat funding restrictions

The justices disagreed in their 6-3 decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court’s three liberal justices dissented.
“Obscenity is no exception to the widespread practice of requiring proof of age to exercise age-restricted rights,” Thomas wrote, citing laws restricting alcohol use or handgun purchases. 
South Dakota lawmakers passed, and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed, an age verification bill this year, but its language is more broad than that of the Texas law.
For the law set to take effect Tuesday in South Dakota, age verification would be required of any site that hosts adult material “in the regular course of the website’s trade or business.”
Lawmakers were cautioned during the session that such broad verbiage could draw First Amendment challenges regardless of the outcome in the Texas case. Some argued explicitly for an age verification law that mirrored the one in Texas.
South Dakota’s law requires websites to delete proof of age information immediately after an adult provides it. Adult websites that fail to perform age verification would be subject to criminal fines.
Ruling: ‘Incidental’ privacy infringement acceptable
The Supreme Court’s Friday ruling drew lines around any free speech arguments that might be deployed about South Dakota’s law.
At issue in the Texas case was not just the constitutionality of age verification laws, but how courts are meant to review them.
Texas wanted the Supreme Court to give it – and other states, by extension – broad authority to write laws restricting minors’ access to online pornography. The Free Speech Coalition said age verification laws ought to be minimally restrictive because they affect First Amendment rights.
Neither side prevailed on that issue. Instead, the justices said the Texas law stood up to what it called “intermediate scrutiny.” 
The state’s strictures amount to an “incidental” burden on adults’ free speech, but adults can still get the content, the majority ruled. 
A law that only requires age verification for sites on which one-third or more of the content is obscene is narrowly tailored enough to achieve Texas’ goal of targeting pornography, the court ruled.
“It is reasonable for Texas to conclude that websites with a higher proportion of sexual content are more inappropriate for children to visit than those with a lower proportion,” Thomas wrote.
In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the state of Texas ought to have tailored its law more narrowly “to ensure it is not undervaluing the interest in free expression.”
Restrictions on free speech, she said, should be viewed with the courts’ most critical eye.
“Many reasonable people, after all, view the speech at issue here as ugly and harmful for any audience,” Kagan wrote. “But the First Amendment protects those sexually explicit materials, for every adult. So a state cannot target that expression, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children.”
Future for South Dakota law
Unlike the Texas version, South Dakota’s age verification law does not apply to sites with a certain proportion of adult content.
It’s more sweeping language applying it to sites that host porn in their “regular course” of business was a cause of concern for some lobbyists and lawmakers, as well as for Attorney General Marty Jackley. 
Lobbyist Doug Abraham told the Senate Judiciary Committee in February that age verification for any site with adult material would be akin to carding anyone who enters a shopping mall because a store in the mall sells alcohol.
Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, who’s since been appointed as a circuit court judge, was among the lawmakers who argued on behalf of a bill with a one-third content standard nearly identical to the Texas law. That bill failed.
Jackley told lawmakers that he supports age verification for porn sites, but told them he’d rather defend a law that looks like the one passed by Texas.

Rep. Bethany Soye, R-Sioux Falls, sponsored the version of the bill that’s set to become law on Tuesday.
Soye told her colleagues that the one-third standard was “made up” by the Louisiana lawmakers who were the first to move on age verification.
A cutoff line for adult content creates a loophole, she said. To avoid adherence to the law, sites could make sure that their adult material represents just under one-third of its content.
Soye also said that legal battles sparked by a strong moral stance are worth the investment of the state’s time and treasure.
As of Friday afternoon, the state had not been sued in federal court over the law. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota argued against the bill in Pierre. Andrew Malone, its senior staff attorney, said Friday in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight that the Supreme Court “has departed from decades of settled precedents that ensured that sweeping laws purportedly for the benefit of minors do not limit adults’ access to First Amendment-protected materials.”
“With this decision, the court has carved out an unprincipled pornography exception to the First Amendment. The Constitution should protect adults’ rights to access information about sex online, even if the government thinks it is too inappropriate for children to see,” Malone said. “Efforts to childproof the internet not only hurt everyone’s ability to access information, but also give the government far too much leeway to go after speech it doesn’t like — all while failing to actually protect children.”
The Free Speech Coalition did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the South Dakota law, but Alison Boden, executive director, posted about the Paxton ruling on social media.
“As it has been throughout history, pornography is once again the canary in the coal mine of free expression,” Boden said, in part. “The government should not have the right to demand that we sacrifice our privacy and security to use the internet.”

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Lee’s Iowa newspapers include the Quad-City Times in Davenport, the Sioux City Journal, the Mason City Globe-Gazette the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier and the Muscatine Journal.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case
It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Two Oklahoma attorneys have sued state leaders, arguing that the state’s newly created business court system is unconstitutional. 
Joe E. White Jr. and Jason Waddell filed suit Thursday against Gov. Kevin Stitt, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton and House Speaker Kyle Hilbert. White and Waddell are seeking a temporary injunction from the Oklahoma Supreme Court that would block Stitt from appointing judges to the new business courts set to open later this year in Oklahoma City and Tulsa until the court can weigh on the constitutionality of Senate Bill 632. 
The lawsuit contends the legislation, which passed late in session, is unconstitutional in part because of the high $1,565 filing fee and because lawmakers are attempting to bypass the Judicial Nominating Commission, a voter-approved board that helps fills judicial vacancies by screening potential applicants and submitting a list of finalists to the governor to choose from. It also argues that the Legislature did not have the authority to create the courts.
An emergency injunction is necessary because the new law takes effect Sept. 1, and Hilbert is expected to soon submit nominees to the Governor for the first two judges who will preside over the business courts, according to the lawsuit. 
“It would be unfair to ask any applicant for one of the two judicial positions to give up their law practice or judgeship during the pendency of this action,” according to the lawsuit.
State leaders are also expected to begin leasing space in Oklahoma and Tulsa counties this summer and hire staff for the courts.
“This meritless lawsuit is a Hail Mary pass thrown by trial attorneys who profit from maintaining the status quo,” Stitt said. “Our business court law will make Oklahoma the most business friendly state, in part by limiting lawsuit abuse by trial attorneys.” 
Passing legislation creating a court system that specializes in litigating business disputes, commercial lawsuits and other related issues that equal or exceed $500,000 was a top priority for the Republican governor. 
Under the proposed system, the court’s judges would be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. They would be selected from a list of three candidates selected by the Speaker of the House. 
“This legal challenge to business courts was anticipated by members of the Legislature during session,” Hilbert said in a statement. “Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, the House is committed to ensuring an effective court system for all Oklahomans.”
A spokesman for Paxton declined to comment until they had time to review the lawsuit.

The Republican National Committee filed a motion in federal court Thursday asking to intervene in a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law.  Set to go into effect on Tuesday, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.

The po[...]","The Republican National Committee filed a motion in federal court Thursday asking to intervene in a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law. 
Set to go into effect on Tuesday, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. The law will also require someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in Wyoming for at least 30 days. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, filed a lawsuit in May, alleging the new law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague as written. The group has asked the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
High-profile attorneys — who have fought for and against President Trump on the national stage — have since flocked to both sides of the case. 
Even so, “when a state’s election laws are challenged in federal court, political parties should be granted intervention to protect their unique interests,” the Republican National Committee argued in its motion to intervene. 
If the court grants the request, the RNC would become a defendant in the case alongside Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the state’s 23 county clerks. 
As the primary governing body for the Republican Party in the United States, the group is responsible for organizing the party’s national convention, developing its political platform, coordinating campaign strategies and fundraising. 
When Arizona’s documentary-proof-of-citizenship requirement was challenged “on the same constitutional grounds in federal court, the RNC was granted intervention,” according to the motion. 
Wyoming’s law was a key priority for Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which wields a majority in the Wyoming House of Representatives. 
The secretary and the Freedom Caucus have both claimed Wyoming was “the first in the nation” to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. The RNC’s motion, however, indicates Arizona had already adopted such and seen it challenged in court. 
“The RNC’s involvement has proven essential in that [Arizona] case; it has raised arguments and appealed decisions that the state defendants wouldn’t, and it secured emergency relief from the Supreme Court this past election cycle that each state defendant opposed,” the motion states. 
The RNC also argues that “safeguarding Republican voter confidence in the legitimacy of Wyoming’s electoral process” necessitates the group’s intervention in the case. 
Last November, prior to the election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in the 2024 election to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey.
If the court were to rule against the new law, “the RNC would need to divert resources from other mission-critical activities towards get-out-the-vote activities to reinsure Republican voter trust in Wyoming’s electoral system, to independently verify the accuracy of Wyoming’s voter registration rolls, and to educate voters and candidates concerning Wyoming’s changed registration requirements,” the motion argues. 
The RNC also argues that the current defendants — Gray and the state’s county clerks — do not adequately represent the Republican Party’s interests. 
“Defendants are Wyoming state officials, who must necessarily represent ‘the public interest,’” the motion states. “By contrast, the RNC’s interest is inherently ‘partisan.’”
Gray told WyoFile he welcomes “this motion to help support our arguments in defending Wyoming’s common-sense, conservative election integrity law requiring proof of citizenship for registering to vote.” 
“We need all hands on deck to combat radical left-wing DNC attorney Marc Elias’ attacks on any and all conservative election integrity reforms, including Wyoming’s common-sense proof of citizenship requirement,” Gray wrote.
Friday marked the deadline for Gray and his attorneys to respond to the Equality State Policy Center’s request for a temporary restraining order against the law until the case has been resolved. It had not been filed by publishing time.

Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)In the shadow of Three Mile Island’s iconic cooling towers, state Rep. Tom Mehaffie recalled Wednesday how his father, 50 years earlier, built a career and a life around the nuclear power plant.
“When Constellation left and this plant shut down, a lot was missed,” Mehaffie said, noting the fortunes of businesses and the community followed that of the plant in Dauphin County.
Now, state government and energy and tech industry leaders are betting on its rebirth as an example of Pennsylvania’s readiness to power future industries, including electricity-intensive artificial intelligence data centers.
In a $16 billion deal between owner Constellation Energy and Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers, Three Mile Island is set to return to service as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Let’s not just open this plant, let’s open business,” Mehaffie told a tent full of Constellation Energy workers gathered to celebrate progress in the plant’s restoration, including an expedited review that cuts about a year off the project’s timeline.
About 10 miles south of Harrisburg near Middletown, Three Mile Island was the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that transfixed the world. But after that partial meltdown in one of the plant’s two reactors, the remaining Unit 1 continued safely producing electricity for another 40 years.
In 2019, Constellation determined the facility was no longer economically viable and put plans in motion to permanently decommission the reactor. With peak energy demand, driven largely by data centers, predicted to grow up to 17% by 2035, the plant’s capacity is now in high demand.
“We made a mistake in shutting down this plant, but we’re not here to dwell on that mistake,” Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said, noting that hiring staff for the recommissioning process is ahead of schedule because many former workers returned.
The plant’s reopening will support at least 650 permanent jobs and hundreds more for building-trade workers during the recommissioning process.
Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomed the returning workers Wednesday, as he highlighted the role of nuclear power in his energy plan.
“We’re going to make sure you never have to leave again,” Shapiro said. “This is going to be one of those places where the jobs get passed down from generation to generation, where fathers talk to their daughters about the work that they did, and their daughters pick up that mantle of energy leadership right here at Crane.”
Shapiro has outlined a plan over the last two years to ensure the commonwealth remains a leader in the competitive energy market, by leveraging the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Shapiro noted his administration intervened to ensure the Crane center would be able to quickly reconnect to the regional power grid that serves Pennsylvania and all or parts of 12 other states.
PJM Interconnect, which operates the grid and ensures adequate energy supplies, has a backlog of projects waiting to be approved for connection. The company created its Reliable Resource Initiative last year to expedite the interconnection of 51 shovel-ready generating resources that include battery storage, nuclear and natural gas facilities, a PJM spokesperson said.
Shapiro, who describes himself as an “all of the above energy governor,” noted the state has four operating nuclear power plants that provide nearly one-third of its energy.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Shapiro said. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said the Crane center is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring nuclear energy online with the speed needed to match the growth of artificial intelligence.
“It’s a unique opportunity where we can bring together a supportive community, state and a skilled workforce that is absolutely the best kept secret ingredient,” Hollis said.
Microsoft’s agreement to purchase all of the Crane center’s 835 megawatt output demonstrates the importance of abundant energy for tech industry growth, Shapiro said.
“That is a heck of a signal of the optimism people feel about Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting that Amazon also recently announced a $20 billion investment in a data complex near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County.
PJM interconnection president and CEO Manu Asthana said as the state swelters through its first heatwave of the summer, the growth in demand for energy is apparent. PJM this week recorded an all-time peak in electricity production, nine gigawatts larger than last summer’s peak. Asthana said the difference is equal to 11 times the Crane center’s planned output.
“What we’re talking about here is not hypothetical. Our country needs this power. All of our citizens need this power just to keep their lights on, to stay warm, to stay cool,” he said, adding that ensuring power for all that plus AI is a matter of national security.
“I can’t imagine by 2030 what artificial intelligence will enable us to do and strategically, for our country, for our state, for our region, it is critical that we win that race, and the power that you produce here is critical to winning that race.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Seven years after the Florida Legislature approved a memorial recognizing the tragedy of slavery for the grounds of the Florida Capitol, the bronze statue called “Circle of Chains” has been completed and is on display across the street from the building.
Not that anyone is actually aware of that.
“I had no idea!” Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt told the Phoenix when asked about the public unveiling of the memorial earlier this week.
Neither did Miami-Dade County Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“I had no idea the memorial had even been installed – and that says a lot,” Jones told the Phoenix. “A monument honoring the pain and resilience of enslaved Africans deserves more than a quiet placement. After seven years of work, there should have been a moment to honor that history publicly.”
Approved in 2018
The Legislature approved the memorial during the 2018 legislative session. Miami-Dade Democrat Kionne McGhee sponsored the measure in the House, and Tampa Bay-area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson carried it in the Senate. The bill charged the Department of Management Services with developing its design, placement, and cost. It is located at the Black Archives-Union Bank Museum on Apalachee Parkway and was installed on April 28.
“The idea behind the memorial is to recognize the brutality of slavery and the cruelty of slavery towards a people and then to honor the nameless faces of individuals that suffer through slavery,” Rouson said this week
State lawmakers dedicated $400,000 to erect the memorial, as they did during the 2016 legislative session for a Holocaust Memorial that was installed at the Capital earlier this year. A public ceremony was held  for that event in March, attended by Gov. DeSantis.
The monument was created by Carmel, California, sculptor Steven Whyte, selected by review committee members who called on artists to recognize “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the American colonies and to honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty contributions to the United States.”
As the House prepared to vote on the proposal in 2018, Rep. McGhee told lawmakers that slaves in 1845 helped construct the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee, according to WFSU-Radio. PolitiFact reported that although authorities were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction, African American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th Century, according to historians. PolitiFact labeled his comment “mostly true.” (McGhee, now a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, did not respond to a request for comment).
Plans for a Formal Ceremony
Rouson said he was informed by state officials that they wanted to install surveillance cameras on the property before making any formal announcement. “But now that surveillance is in place and there’s some protection in the event of vandalism, I intend to urge the Black Caucus to do more of a formal ceremony when we go back [this fall] for committee weeks,” he said.
Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said she knew the memorial was being constructed but wasn’t aware it had been finished and is now open to the public.
“I wholeheartedly support Sen. Rouson’s efforts for a formal opening ceremony this fall — the enslaved men, women, and children who built this country deserve to have their experience remembered and their legacy honored,” she said.
Sen. Jones said he also supports Rouson’s call for a “proper ceremony when we return.”
“Our ancestors deserve to be seen and acknowledged,” he said.

Dick Harpootlian, talk about their legal challenge to a legislative pay raise that inadvertently also halted existing payments outside Harpootlian's Columbia office on Monday, June 9, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State legislators will get a pay cut following a state Supreme Court order that halted so-called “in-district compensation” payments.
The Wednesday order came in response to a legal challenge over a $1,500 monthly raise legislators included in the state budget.
The $1,000 legislators have been receiving each month since 1995 under that same budget clause became collateral damage in the pause. If the state’s high court sides with the state senator questioning the constitutionality of the raise, the pay could go away altogether, cutting legislators’ incomes by $12,000 per year.
The change would apply only to the money meant to pay for duties outside the Statehouse. Legislators would still receive their annual salary of $10,400 and stipends for food and lodging during session, which are currently $240 per day.
The order instructed the state treasurer to stop “distributing any funds” under the clause included in the state budget that goes into effect Tuesday.
Because legislators rewrote the existing clause instead of adding a new one with the increased amount, that affected the entire sum they would have received.
“In light of the Court’s order, I want to inform you that, at a minimum, no in-district payments will be made on July 16 or August 16,” Senate President Thomas Alexander wrote in a letter to senators Wednesday. “To be specific, this amount includes both the prior $1,000 as well as the $1,500 increase. Any future payments will depend on further action by the Supreme Court in this matter.”
Representatives received a similar notification from the House clerk, emphasizing that the decision will affect the entire monthly payment, not just the raise.
Even the 44 Republicans in both chambers who turned down the increase will lose out on their normal $1,000 each month.
SC Supreme Court presses pause on legislative pay raise pending final decision

That could be the case for the foreseeable future, said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, who’s among the Republicans who opted out of the raise.
The court order set a deadline of Sept. 4 for legal filings, though it could take longer for justices to come to a decision.
If the justices decide the raise is unconstitutional, they can’t keep the original payments in play without rewriting a piece of the state budget, a move that would go beyond the court’s authority, the Edgefield Republican said.
Legislators could reinstate the original amount, but getting the votes to do so during an election year for the House, as 2026 will be, is unlikely because of the potential campaign fodder it could give opponents, Massey said.
In that case, legislators would go at least a year and a half with the lowest salary they’ve had in decades.
“I don’t think we can fix it,” Massey said.
That wasn’t the intention, said Sen. Wes Climer, who is challenging the raise in court. He didn’t have a problem with the in-district compensation itself, he added, but rather with legislators increasing it during a non-election year.
“It’s unfortunate,” the Rock Hill Republican said. “It’s not the desired outcome. But the fault for this outcome lies with those who tried to cheat. That outcome is still better than the Legislature appropriating itself the people’s money in real time.”
Climer, represented by former senator and Columbia attorney Dick Harpootlian, has argued in court filings that the raise violates a provision in the state constitution that bars legislators from increasing their own “per diem.”
When the 1890 constitution that still governs the state went into effect, that per diem was the only payment legislators received, so it effectively covered all of their income, Harpootlian has argued in court filings.
Attorneys for the House and Senate have argued the constitutional clause barring legislators from raising their own per diem applies only to the subsistence stipends meant to cover meals and lodging. The in-district compensation qualifies as a reimbursement, even though legislators don’t have to report how they spent the money, attorneys for both chambers have argued in legal filings.
Senators who voted both for and against the raise are frustrated knowing they’re getting at least a temporary pay cut, Massey said.
The last time legislators tried to increase their in-district compensation, in 2014, they did so in a separate budget clause that would have given legislators the option of an extra $1,000 per month. Then-Gov. Nikki Haley vetoed the raise, but because it was a separate part of the budget, legislators’ existing pay remained in place.
Losing a portion of what little legislators make “discourages people who don’t have individual wealth or own their own business from running for office,” said Rep. John King, a longtime supporter of increasing legislators’ pay.
The Rock Hill Democrat used his $1,000 each month to help pay for extra staff at the funeral home he runs so he could spend more time helping constituents, he said. He’ll be able to make up the difference by paying out of pocket, but others may not, he said.
Conversations around increasing pay to encourage more people to run for office are worthwhile, Massey said. Having people from different backgrounds often leads to more points of view on issues and, therefore, better legislation, he said.
“Having a pay decrease certainly doesn’t help that,” Massey said.
But legislators went about getting a raise the wrong way by adding it to the state budget instead of going through a committee process that would have included vetting and public input, he said. His opposition to how the raise was approved is why he turned it down.
Going through the normal committee process probably would have flagged the constitutional question and allowed legislators to write the law in a way that wouldn’t put their current pay in jeopardy, he said.
“There are consequences to doing it this way,” Massey said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4048-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement sai

Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced this week that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking Monday at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.

“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
More than 250,000 acres of federal land in North Dakota are categorized Inventoried Roadless Areas. Most of it is in the western part of the state.
Some road construction and reconstruction is already allowed on this land, according to a U.S. Forest Service map.
The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to an email seeking more specific information about how the policy change could affect North Dakota.
The office of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., called repealing the rule a step in the right direction.
“While road construction is currently permitted, rescission of the 2001 Roadless Rule removes the threat of future restrictions inhibiting access to multiple use activities like grazing and energy production,” the office said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican who attended the Western Governors’ Association meeting, also praised Rollins’ proposal.
“Increasing access to public lands is a win for North Dakota, and rescinding this rule further enables responsible federal lands management, including the continuation of responsible grazing practices,” Armstrong said in a statement.
Shannon Straight, executive director of the Badland Conservation Alliance, said that the proposed repeal of the rule is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to strip away public land protections.
“We’re losing our wilderness, we’re losing our habitat,” Straight said.
He also said millions of acres of public lands could be sold off under the “big, beautiful bill.” North Dakota isn’t one of them, according to an analysis published last week by the Wilderness Society, though the bill’s text is still being revised.
Straight said that regardless, North Dakotans that care about public lands should still urge the state’s congressional delegation to oppose the sales.
USDA says repealing ‘roadless’ protections will prevent wildfires. A new study disagrees

The roadless rule announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Maryland parents who object, for religious reasons, to the Montgomery County school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion says.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent says.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

,California,2025-06-27 18:38:16+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom takes Fox News to court over call with Donald Trump,Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/california-newsom-lawsuit-fox-news/,"In his lawsuit, Newsom claims that Fox News “covered up” the president’s false statement regarding the timing of a call between Trump and Newsom.","In summary
In his lawsuit, Newsom claims that Fox News “covered up” the president’s false statement regarding the timing of a call between Trump and Newsom.


Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for defamation, claiming that the network lied about the date he last spoke with President Donald Trump on the phone and accused the governor of lying about the call.
“By disregarding basic journalistic ethics in favor of malicious propaganda, Fox continues to play a major role in the further erosion of the bedrock principles of informed representative government,” the lawsuit reads.
The lawsuit, filed Friday by Newsom as an individual, seeks $787 million in damages from the network — roughly the same amount Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 to settle a defamation case over the network’s election claims. Newsom promised to drop the suit if Fox News retracts its claim that Newsom lied and issues a formal on-air apology.
To some Democratic strategists, Newsom’s move demonstrates the governor’s willingness to check Trump’s power. It is the latest episode of an on-again-off-again feud between him and Trump, who collaborated over Los Angeles wildfire aid earlier this year but fought over the president’s deployment of troops to quell unrest in the same city despite Newsom’s objection.  
“Democrats across the country are out there yearning for Democrats to take on Trump,” said longtime Democratic consultant Garry South. “Partly through Trump’s own stumbles and his own mistakes, I think that he has inadvertently boosted Newsom into the position of being the chief protagonist against him.”
Fox News said in a statement that it would defend the case “vigorously.” 
“Gov. Newsom’s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him,” the statement said.
Newsom’s attorneys argued in a letter that the network intentionally misled its audience into believing the governor lied about his last call with Trump earlier this month, before the two clashed over Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement. 
The governor spoke with Trump over the phone for 16 minutes on June 7, the letter said. But Trump told a reporter on June 10 that he’d spoken with Newsom “a day ago” instead, stating that he had called Newsom “to tell him, got to do a better job, he’s doing a bad job.”
Newsom rebuked the president in a statement on X, arguing there was no call or even a voicemail from Trump on that day. “Americans should be alarmed that a President deploying Marines onto our streets doesn’t even know who he’s talking to,” he said.
But Fox News hosts John Roberts and Jesse Watters left out Trump’s comment suggesting the call had taken place June 9 in their coverage, Newsom’s attorneys argued. And Watters claimed on air that Newsom lied, even though he reported that call logs showed the call occurred on June 6.  
“Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him? Why would he do that?” Watters said, with a banner appearing on screen simultaneously that said: “Gavin lied about Trump’s call.”
Newsom’s attorneys argued the coverage shows the network’s effort to “cover up for President Trump’s error.”
But in suing Fox News, Newsom is taking a page from Trump’s own playbook by suing prominent media outlets for their coverage, drawing concern from First Amendment advocates who urged Newsom to drop the case.
“Lawsuits like this risk becoming a form of censorship and send a troubling message to news organizations: that they may face legal retaliation for their work,” said Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10072022-Newsom-Presser-RL-CM-011.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

With more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, our state is harnessing the power of the sun to lower energy bills, create jobs, and strengthen our grid.
But that progress — and the local jobs and savings it brings — is now under serious threat.
At the heart of this issue is the federal residential solar investment tax credit, known as the 25D credit.
For decades, this incentive has helped thousands of South Carolinians afford rooftop solar systems. It’s been a win-win: Homeowners cut their energy bills, and solar companies expand operations, hiring local workers to meet the growing demand.
But the so-called “One Big Beautiful” budget bill — which the president wants on his desk by July 4 — aims to eliminate the 25D credit within months.
This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.

The timing couldn’t be worse. Rooftop solar is an important energy generation source that can be scaled up quickly.
That speed is critical as our state grapples with rising electricity demand, aging grid infrastructure, and the growing costs of fossil fuels.
And the potential doesn’t stop at homes.
South Carolina is rich in industrial and commercial rooftop space — warehouses, factories, and retail stores with untapped solar potential. Ending the 25D credit would slam the brakes on this opportunity just as momentum is building.
The broader economic impact is no less troubling.
A new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that gutting these tax credits could cause an immediate drop in solar and storage investments across the U.S.
By 2030, as much as $220 billion in investment could be lost. This doesn’t just impact solar panel installers, but also manufacturers, electricians, engineers, and logistics providers who all contribute to this growing clean energy economy.
And as Republicans in the Senate thrash out the details, the policy uncertainty is already having repercussions. More than $9 billion in investments have already been cancelled or stalled in 2025, according to E2. Republican districts have been hit the hardest.
In South Carolina, we’ve already seen what federal clean energy incentives can do.
Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, our state has secured over $15 billion in clean energy investment — second only to North Carolina. Projects from companies like Scout Motors and Redwood Materials are bringing thousands of new jobs to the Palmetto State.
Unfortunately, many of the same South Carolina lawmakers whose districts are benefiting from this boom have succumbed to partisan pressure to phase out the very credits spurring the investment. That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.
This isn’t just bad politics — it’s an economic misfire.
Removing the 25D credit means fewer homeowners can afford solar, fewer installers stay in business, and fewer South Carolinians get hired. It also makes our grid more vulnerable and our energy prices more volatile.
Meanwhile, state-level actions like the so-called South Carolina Energy Security Act, which was signed into law in May, are poised to make things worse by allowing utilities to raise rates annually.
Repealing existing federal clean energy tax credits and funding programs would increase average annual household energy costs in South Carolina (including electricity and fuel expenses) by nearly $50 per year in 2030 and nearly $270 per year in 2035 (Energy Innovation Policy & Technology).
The good news? The bill is not yet signed, sealed or delivered to the Oval Office.
Preserving the 25D credit and other clean energy incentives could add $32 billion to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade and support nearly 220,000 full-time jobs, according to a study commissioned by American Clean Power.
This isn’t a red state or blue state issue — it’s a commonsense economic one.
Clean energy tax credits are delivering real results in South Carolina.
Undoing them now would undercut years of progress, threaten jobs, and raise costs for families and businesses.
Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and their colleagues in the House have long championed South Carolina’s economic growth.
They can now help protect one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, rooftop solar, and the jobs of hardworking South Carolinians who are building our clean energy future — one rooftop at a time.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-at-home-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker began his third campaign for governor on Thursday, but much of the buzz around his 2026 campaign announcement focused on 2028.

Pritzker made four stops around the state to launch his campaign, fielding questions about any future interest in the presidency and what is driving him to run for what would be a historic third term. In his final stop in Springfield on Thursday evening, he was toasting personally branded “JBeers” – his own craft beer product he unveiled at least year’s Democratic National Convention – with a group of about 100 people at a small event venue just outside the Capitol and talking about his motivations.

“Every day I’m going to wake up going forward thinking about what I am going to do that’s going to help the people of Illinois,” Pritzker told reporters in Springfield when asked how many years of a third term he would serve. “So that’s the reason I’m running for reelection, it’s why I announced today, it’s what I’m going to do every day going forward no matter what decision I make.”

The 60-year-old Democrat’s national profile has grown significantly over the last year. He was a finalist to be former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate last July, and weeks later, introduced himself to the country on the stage of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In the months since President Donald Trump took office, Pritzker has emerged as one of his most vocal critics.

At news conferences throughout the state, Pritzker did not directly commit to serving a full four-year term if he is reelected and sidestepped questions about his rumored White House ambitions.

But while staying tight-lipped about what he thinks about his prospects in the 2028 presidential election, he said any decision he makes about his future would be Illinois-centric.

Speculation shows Pritzker ‘capable and competent’

In the meantime, Pritzker said he believed his inclusion in the national conversation is good for Illinois.

“When I ran for governor in the first place in 2017 and 2018, never, never could I have imagined that anybody would talk about me as the potential vice-presidential nominee or as a candidate for president of the United States,” Pritzker said.

While Republicans have frequently criticized the governor for his tendencies to criticize Trump rather than work with him to Illinois’ benefit, the governor spun his rising national profile as a positive.

“Having the state of Illinois’ leaders viewed as capable and competent and potentially able to run the entire country and being talked about in that way, allows us, I think, to get more for the people of Illinois because there’s an understanding that, you know, maybe in Illinois we’re doing the right things,” he said. “Maybe in Illinois we have leaders that can competently execute on what states really need.”

Pritzker said his experience last summer being vetted for the vice presidency has not played any role in the decisions he has made about his political career.

Should Pritzker decide to run for president, an announcement would likely come at some point in 2027 during what would be the first year of his third term if he’s reelected.

Pritzker’s goal: ‘Protect’ Illinois and his legacy

Pritzker said at his announcement Thursday that his goal in 2026 is to preserve his legacy and “protect” the story of Illinois that’s been written under his leadership. Pritzker didn’t outline a bold vision for his third term but rather pledged to build off what he has already accomplished.

He said his third term would focus on grappling with artificial intelligence, addressing the rising cost of living, continued spending on infrastructure and growing the state’s economy.

Pritzker reflected on his decision to seek reelection despite growing challenges facing the state.

“I don’t shy away from a fight, and we’re going to have to protect the people of Illinois,” Pritzker told reporters in Springfield. “And I feel like we’re in a moment when backing away from public service when things are hard doesn’t feel right. So that’s one of the reasons I chose to run for reelection.”

Pritzker was asked whether he would have run had Trump not been elected last year.

“I think I would, but I have to say that in this moment, it feels like walking away is the wrong thing to do given who is in the White House and given how this administration is attacking people all across this country,” Pritzker said.

The governor must also choose a new running mate as Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has decided to run for U.S. Senate. Pritzker said he will choose one by the end of July so his campaign can start circulating nominating petitions in early August. Pritzker said in Chicago that he is looking for someone with enough experience to take over as governor if required.

Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, may be an early front-runner for the job. Pritzker specifically referred to Gordon-Booth as qualified at a stop in East Peoria on Thursday when asked about potential running mates, WGLT reported. The assistant House majority leader has been in the General Assembly since 2009.

When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.



Florida now requires schools to implement a review process for library materials objected to by parents and community members who think the content is pornographic or inappropriate. Laws that necessitate parental approval have drawn lawsuits and free speech concerns. Lawmakers have acknowledged excessive numbers of objections were raised and now nonparent residents are restricted to one objection per month.
In Florida, the attorney general recently opened a parental-rights arm to litigate laws related to gender transition, library materials, school surveys, and other topics that have dominated legislative, judicial, and executive conversations in recent years. In announcing the office, Uthmeier said Florida has been a “shining city on a hill” for “enshrining parental rights.”

Brenda Johnston Naatz Bandy passed gracefully on Wednesday, June 25th, 2025, surrounded by love, laughter, and music. Born on November 4th, 1939, in St. Johnsbury to Doris and Charles Naatz, she was an excellent daughter, sister, and occasional farmhand on their family dairy farm.
Among Brenda’s many gifts was the ability to make life feel simultaneously sacred and as amusing as a Carol Burnett skit. Her beauty was only rivaled by her talent, humor, and boundless care for others. As Miss Vermont, she performed a side-splitting Victor Borge comedy routine on the piano at the 1960 Miss America Pageant, winning the talent portion of the competition. She earned scholarships for her creative skills and attended Rochester Institute of Technology to study Interior Design before returning to Vermont to care for her mother in her final years. While Miss Vermont, she also won the attention of her assigned Cadet escort, Bill Currier, with whom she quickly fell in love. They married and traveled the world while raising three rambunctious children before settling in upstate New York. There, she was a church organist, choir director, a full-time mother, and the one-woman powerhouse of an 11-acre horse farm, where she boarded over a dozen horses and taught riding—all while keeping her sense of humor (and most of her sanity). 
She played every instrument she encountered with otherworldly skill, though her favorites include the pipe organ at the Peacham Congregational Church, piano, bagpipes, and the accordion. In addition to her endless musical and performing talents, she was a gifted craftsperson. She excelled at creating model horse-drawn carriages and miniature dollhouses along with all of the delicate painting, sculpture, and leatherwork that entailed.

A lifelong equestrian, Brenda’s love for horses easily withstood a lifetime of shoveling manure. She won several accolades and blue ribbons for her Morgan horses—including one New York State Grand Champion Morgan mare, Vanderland Gabrielle “Gabby”—and taught all of her children and grandchildren how to ride (and clean the stalls). Her deep love for animals was unmatched; even the most skittish stray cats grew to return her affections tenfold. 
Brenda was a skillful and beloved teacher and returned to school to earn her music teaching degree in 1986 at the age of 47. She taught music to all grades at Blue Mountain Union, where she met her second husband, Arnold Bandy, a social studies teacher and athletic director. Together, they shared great pride in teaching and learning with their students. With endless energy and enthusiasm, she led her students to create elaborate, impressive musical productions. Her pride in teaching was well earned, as she taught all those around her how to make things that mattered—music, art, a home, a life—by hand, by heart, and with just the right amount of humor.
For Brenda, the sun rose and set over the children in her life. She is survived by her beloved children, Tonya Currier and her husband Dan Griggs, Miles Currier and his wife Cheryl, Matthew Bandy and his wife Anne, and Auburn Watersong; her niece, Jennifer Gilman and her husband Peter Pelissier; her adored grandchildren, Tia Hohman and her husband Rusty, Gabe Harter, Emma Harter, and Liam Currier; her great-niece Kelsey Gilman and her great-nephews Teddy Gilman and Chad Larabee; her dearest and only great-grandchildren, Eden and Ezra Hohman. Brenda leaves behind a sprawling chosen family of dear friends and creative kin who will carry her memory forward with laughter, music, and love. 
In her passing, Brenda joins her husband, Arnold Bandy, her dear sisters Carolyn and Frannie, her beloved nephew Charlie “Thumper” Gilman, many close girlfriends, as well as dozens of spoiled horses, ponies, cats, dogs, and at least one goat waiting patiently for her to return with treats.

Patrick Morrisey gives an update on flood recovery at the Marion County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management  in Fairmont, W.Va. on Friday, June 27, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)Flash floods on Thursday evening struck several parts of West Virginia, including an area in the northern part of the state still reeling from severe weather earlier this month. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Friday no loss of life has been reported as a result of Thursday’s flash floods. Officials are assessing any new damage that might have occurred in Ohio County on Thursday, he said. 
“I know that I saw some pictures coming out of Triadelphia from last night, and that was a community that was hit very, very hard,” Morrisey said Friday during a press briefing from Fairmont. 
According to the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh, about 1.6 inches of rain fell in an hour in parts of the Wheeling area Thursday evening, causing roads and basements to flood and some creeks to exceed their banks. 
Nine people died in the flash floods that washed through northern West Virginia after several inches of rain fell in a short period of time June 14 and 15. 
The body of a ninth victim, 83-year-old Sandra Kay Parsons, was found in the Ohio River on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. No other people are believed to be unaccounted for, Morrisey said this week.
Overnight Thursday, high water caused the northbound lanes of the West Virginia Turnpike to be closed near the Dawes exit in Kanawha County for more than eight hours, according to news reports. 
According to radar estimates from the National Weather Service in Charleston, around 6 inches of rain fell Thursday evening in that area of the county, meteorologist Ray Young said. 
Morrisey said state officials are investigating the Turnpike closure, which he called “unacceptable.”
“We’re going to get to the bottom of everything,” Morrisey said. “I’m going to tell you that we’re going to get to the bottom of things to make sure that everything is done right, and if there are problems that were decisions that were made that were bad, we’re going to make sure that we let people know about that… But most importantly, we’re trying to make sure that that road is fully passable.”
Morrisey has asked for a federal disaster declaration that would make assistance available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Ohio and Marion counties for the floods earlier this month. He said he’s been in close contact with the Trump administration about the request. 
Morrisey stressed that flooded residents who have not done so should fill out a damage survey, available online at emd.wv.gov 
“Ultimately, that’s a critical part of the process to ensure that the feds know exactly what happened on the ground, and then they’ll make financial decisions as a result of it,” he said. “So if you haven’t done so already, we urge people to fill out their disaster survey form.”
Morrisey announced this week the West Virginia Housing Development Fund has approved providing about $500,000 for housing assistance to flooded residents. The funding is also available for those affected by floods in February. 
“It’s hard to fathom just how hard these communities were hit, but they have come together with strength and resilience during this challenging time,” Morrisey said in a statement. “The funds that I’ve made available for housing-related expenses are another step in the recovery process, and we’re working as quickly as possible to distribute these funds to those who need them.”
To apply for housing assistance, flooded residents can visit the Housing Development Fund’s website at https://www.wvhdf.com. 
In addition to the housing assistance, SNAP recipients who lost food during the June 14 and 15 flash floods have until July 7 to apply for benefits to replace it, the state Department of Health announced Thursday. 
The department extended the deadline to apply by 10 days, according to a news release. The extension applies to households in Marion, Ohio and Monongalia counties who lost food because of the severe storms that began on June 14. 
SNAP recipients are eligible for replacement benefits if they lost food due to a power outage that lasted more than four hours, the DoHS said. They must provide verification and a signed affidavit. For more information, contact a local DoHS county office or call the state Office of Constituent Services’ Customer Service Hotline at 1-877-716-1212.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Trump administration on Friday, the state of Washington still intends to seek a nationwide block of the president’s order to restrict birthright citizenship. 
“Washington still plans to seek relief for all its harms — that is what we argued for and won in the trial court,” attorney general’s office spokesperson Mike Faulk said in an email Friday.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, alongside attorneys general from Oregon, Arizona and Illinois, had argued nationwide relief was necessary while litigation plays out over the order. 
But in a 6-3 ruling in the case on Friday, the Supreme Court imposed new limits on lower court judges issuing nationwide injunctions. 
Under the ruling, President Donald Trump’s order could go into effect in 30 days in states that didn’t sue, raising the possibility that babies born to immigrant parents in Washington would be U.S. citizens, while those born in neighboring states like Idaho would not be.
The high court did not rule on the merits of Trump’s executive order. Further legal battles over the order, including with the lawsuit backed by Washington, still lie ahead.
Brown has argued previously that the state, instead of the federal government, would have to pay for social services for babies born in other states without birthright citizenship who later move to states like Washington.
In his Feb. 6 injunction, U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour in Seattle agreed, ordering that anything less than nationwide relief is “ineffectual.” Coughenour’s order was one of three nationwide injunctions the Supreme Court considered.
Brown, in a statement, noted that the justices “confirmed that courts may issue broad injunctions when needed to provide complete relief to the parties.”
“We continue to believe that President Trump’s unconstitutional and cruel order must be stopped across the country to guarantee protection for Washington and its residents,” he continued.
Washington’s case currently sits at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after arguments in Seattle this month. Whether the Supreme Court’s ruling sends the case back to Coughenour is unclear. Faulk said the attorney general’s office expects more clarity on this question soon.
Trump’s executive action aims to end birthright citizenship for babies born to a mother and father who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
In 2022, about 4,000 babies were born in Washington to two parents without legal immigration status, according to the states’ lawsuit.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3450-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

Jeff Landry shakes the hand of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before a bill signing ceremony June 27, 2025, at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry endorsed legislation Friday to “Make American Healthy Again” with the nation’s controversial top health official at his side for the bill signing ceremony.
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended a bill signing ceremony at Pennington Biomedical Research Center after helping craft legislation the Louisiana Legislature approved unanimously to regulate what ingredients can be in the food served in public school lunches.
Kennedy said he anticipates other states will follow Louisiana’s lead, resulting in food manufacturers proactively making changes to improve the contents of their products and reduce the amount of ultra-processed food they generate.  
“We’re seeing the companies coming to the table … because they don’t want what you’re doing here in Louisiana,” Kennedy told the audience.
The key bill Landry signed was Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, which bans several dyes, artificial sweeteners and other ingredients from school meals. In its original state, the proposal also sought to restrict what people could purchase with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, but those provisions were stripped out during the legislative process. 
“It’s about transparency for restaurants and food manufacturers to disclose the types of foods they’re serving us and the impacts on our bodies,” McMath said during his introduction of Kennedy and the governor.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Landry announced Friday he would seek a waiver from the Trump administration to prohibit the purchase of some unhealthy foods with SNAP benefits and seek permission to let people buy certain prepared foods, such as rotisserie chicken. 
McMath’s bill is part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemical additives Kennedy has targeted for elimination. Such products are typically high in calories, sugar, salt and unhealthy fats.
Kennedy, who worked with McMath on the bill, said most of America’s chronic health issues can be linked to the foods they consume.  
Also signed was Senate Bill 19 by Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, which allows pharmacists to provide ivermectin without a doctor’s prescription. Its proponents say ivermectin can be successfully used to treat a variety of ailments, including COVID-19, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved its use for intestinal parasites in pill form and to treat head lice and rosacea as a topical cream.
Though Kennedy praised the bills Landry signed into law, he also called for Congress to approve comparable federal measures. 
“We need national laws, and we’re going to do it on our own,” Kennedy said.

The bill signing ceremony took place at a conference center on the Pennington campus, where the audience included supporters and their children wearing green “MAHA Louisiana” hats. They took to the stage to provide a backdrop for Landry and Kennedy. 
Approximately a dozen conservative legislators were also in attendance. Earlier this month, the state Legislature approved $2 million for Pennington in the state budget to fill in the gaps of Kennedy’s cuts. 
The LSU Board of Supervisors recessed its bi-monthly meeting so its members could take part in the event.
Kennedy previously came to Baton Rouge in 2021 to testify before state lawmakers against a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for K-12 students. It was Landry, who was then the state’s attorney general, who invited him to appear before the legislative committee.
Kennedy’s appearance at Pennington Biomedical Research Center comes as the future of some employees at the facility and their work are in question as the Trump administration proposes drastic reductions in health and scientific research. 
Most recently, Kennedy has removed the members of a vaccine advisory panel for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and replaced them with vaccine skeptics.
Pennington has so far lost $4.1 million in federal research funding from agencies Kennedy oversees, which does not include the tens of millions more they are slated to lose if Kennedy’s proposed slashing of “indirect cost rates” goes into effect. 
When the Illuminator approached Kennedy after the event to ask about these cuts, a staff member quickly whisked him away, saying “he’s not taking questions.”
Dozens of people lined Perkins Road outside the research center to protest Kennedy’s visit.  
The people gathered included Jeanne George of Baton Rouge, whose granddaughters accompanied her and held protest signs by the roadside waiting for Kennedy to arrive.
“I grew up in the 1950s, and I had classmates who had braces because of polio,” George said. “So I’ve seen the benefits of vaccinations from the 1950s on, and I just feel so strongly about the importance of not not rolling us back. We need to continue to have the children being vaccinated. We need to have the flu vaccines. We need to have scientists making decisions about vaccinations and about health.”
Gayle Choojitarom, a retired cardiopulmonary health care professional, came to the protest from Watson. She worked the latter stretch of her career in New Orleans and took issue with the governor choosing a research institute for a “Make America Healthy Again” event.
“If legislation is put forth to Make America healthy again, it should be led by science and by facts and not by vibes and opinions,” Choojitarom said. 
She recalled treating someone in the late 1980s who contracted polio and relied on an iron lung, a respiratory device that helps someone breathe when they have trouble doing so on their own. The eradication of polio through vaccines in the U.S. in 1979 all but eliminated the need for such equipment, but Choojitarom said she fears Kennedy’s policy on vaccine approval and research will erase such progress. 
“We’re going to see more people die,” she said.” We’re going to see children die. We’re going to see babies die.”

(Lori Higgins / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
The high per-student cost for operating buildings at 19 Detroit district schools, some of which also have low enrollment and are underutilized, is creating funding challenges and will have officials wrestling with what to do with them in the coming years.
The district is already in the process of phasing out the operation of four of the schools, but that may not be the fix the district seeks with the remaining schools. No recommendations have been made to the board. But a report on the small schools, discussed during a school board committee meeting Wednesday, outlined potential solutions that include merging schools, stepping up enrollment efforts, reconfiguring grades served, and investing in marketing.
The costly schools in the Detroit Public Schools Community Schools aren’t covering their costs, meaning their expenses far outweigh the revenue received through state and federal funding and grants, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said during the committee meeting.
Northwestern High School, for example, enrolls 302 students and the building has a utilization rate of 23%. On the other side of the city, Pershing High School’s utilization rate is 20%. It enrolls 421 students.
Underutilized schools are a critical issue in Detroit, given the district must fill in the gaps in revenue for the schools that don’t have enough per-pupil revenue coming in. But it’s not a problem unique to Detroit. Enrollment declines across the U.S. mean many districts are grappling with what to do with underutilized schools.
DPSCD enrollment has declined from more than 156,000 in the 2002-03 school year to 49,000 during the last school year. The declines have left schools with far fewer students than they were originally built to hold.
Vitti said Wednesday that the community should not look at the list of 19 schools and assume they are all going to be slated for closure.
“It just means that in order for these schools to continue to function … we have to move money (in the budget) to cover the costs,” he said.
“Most of these schools are going to be fine,” Vitti said later in the meeting. But, he said, the district will have to consider the long-term future of underutilized schools with buildings that need costly work.
Board member Angelique Peterson-Mayberry, who chairs the board’s academics committee, said the information shared at Wednesday’s meeting is important for the community “to go deep into.”
“There’s a science and a method to why we’re saying if schools aren’t kind of paying for themselves with enrollment, this is a way to unpack that so that they understand,” Peterson-Mayberry said.
Among the 19 schools are a handful the district is already phasing out, including Ann Arbor Trail Magnet School, J.E. Clark Preparatory Academy, Catherine Blackwell Institute, and Greenfield Union Elementary-Middle School. At these schools, the district has stopped accepting new students and those enrolled at the time the phase-out began will be allowed to remain until they matriculate. When that happens, the schools will close.
The list includes Paul Robeson-Malcolm X Academy, which moved to another location during the last school year. That move was necessary because the district is constructing another building for the school at the old site. But the move has resulted in enrollment declines — from 392 students to 299 — as some parents opted not to make the move. The district expects enrollment to return to normal once the new school opens.
The list also includes two Montessori schools. Those schools are more costly to operate because Montessori programs require more paraprofessionals than a traditional school, the report says.
The report includes a cost per student as well as what the cost is for a comparison school. The comparison schools are similar schools based on grade band and enrollment type. For instance, schools that require an exam or application in order to enroll are compared to each other.
Below is a list of the schools on the list, not including those already being phased out:
Frederick Douglass Academy for Young Men

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 69
Utilization rate: 5%
Revenue: $1,723,543
Expenses: $3,049,269
Cost per student: $44,192
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: Relocating the school to another high school and operate as a separate school within a school.

Davis Aerospace Technical High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 96
Utilization rate: 13%
Revenue: $1,888,804
Expenses: $3,082,647
Cost per student: $32,111
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: There are already plans to move the school to space the district leases at City Airport. The district will also explore expanding course offerings to non-Davis students.

DPSCD Virtual School

Grades: K-12
Enrollment: 178
Utilization rate: n/a
Revenue: $2,362,709
Expenses: $4,107,150

Detroit Lions Academy

Grades: 6-12 (alternative school)
Enrollment: 391
Utilization rate:
Revenue: $6,555,334
Expenses: $7,809,592
Cost per student: $19,973
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: “Because the demand and need for alternative education settings are high, and because students at the school need smaller, supportive learning environments, continue to fund at current levels,” the report states.

Detroit International Academy for Young Women

Grades: K-12
Enrollment: 246
Utilization rate: 16%
Revenue: $4,066,670
Expenditures: $4,843,925
Cost per student: $19,691
Comparison school cost per student: $14,644
Potential solution: Reconfiguring grades and/or move to a larger high school building and operate it as a program within a school.

Crockett Midtown High School of Science and Medicine

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 186
Utilization rate: 36%
Revenue: $2,882,917
Expenses: $3,241,117
Cost per student: $17,425
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: Eliminate some positions and long-term, consider moving the school to another high school building to operate as a program within a school.

Carstens Academy of Aquatic Science

Grades: PreK-8
Enrollment: 274
Utilization rate: 40%
Revenue: $5,157,224
Expenses:$5,517,800
Cost per student: $20,138
Comparison school cost per student: $14,503
Potential solution: The report says leadership challenges over the years led to low reenrollment rates, and that a new leader along with a new building will restore enrollment and overcome the funding gap.

Mark Twain School for Scholars

Grades: PreK-8
Enrollment: 253
Utilization rate: 49%
Revenue: $4,729,176
Expenses: $5,024,224

Enrollment: 302
Utilization rate: 23%
Revenue: $4,835,242
Expenses: $5,172,957
Cost per student: $17,129
Comparison school cost per student: $12,377
Potential solution: Continue providing prioritized enrollment support with a focus on reenrollment of current students. The district could also consider turning it into a K-12 school by merging with Sampson-Webber Leadership Academy or as a special education center site.

Osborn High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 413
Utilization rate: 34%
Revenue: $6,022,533
Expenditures: $6,440,302
Cost per student: $15,594
Comparison school cost per student: $12,377

Enrollment: 277
Utilization rate: 67%
Revenue: $4,946,746
Expenses: $5,139,978
Cost per student: $18,556
Comparison school cost per student: $14,859
Potential solution: Provide school with prioritized enrollment and reenrollment support. The district may also consider a new building for the school.

Detroit School of Arts

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 523
Utilization rate: 58%
Revenue: $7,362,518
Expenses: $7,706,953
Cost per student: $14,736
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: The district will continue to develop and expand the K-8 performing arts programs to increase enrollment at DSA. Enrollment is actually on the rise at the school, but staff costs are expensive because of the arts programming, the report says.

Pershing High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 421
Utilization rate: 20%
Revenue: $6,125,510
Expenses: $6,328,932
Cost per student: $15,033
Comparison school cost per student: $12,377

Paul Robeson Malcolm X Academy

Grades: PreK-8
Enrollment: 299
Utilization rate: 82%
Revenue: $5,466,768
Expenses: $5,519,697
Cost per student: $18,461
Comparison cost per school: $14,859
Potential solution: The report says: “The school is currently operating out of the former CMA (Communication and Media Arts High School), while a new building is constructed. This had a negative impact on enrollment. When the school relocates back to its new building enrollment will fully fund the school.”

Edmonson Elementary (Montessori)

Grades: Pre-K to 8th grade
Enrollment: 260
Utilization rate: 43%
Revenue: $4,331,072
Expenses: $4,340,392
Cost per student: $16,694
Comparison school cost per student: $14,859
Potential solution: Continue to expand the number of seats in lower grades if teachers and paraprofessionals can be hired to build enrollment and address demand for seats in primary grades. Enrollment is actually on the rise, but the Montessori program requires more staffing than a traditional school, which increases costs.

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow)Community organizers gathered in Raleigh Thursday for a press conference to raise awareness about what they described as attacks on marginalized communities.
The press conference brought together several local organizations from the Triangle region, including Muslims for Social Justice, People’s Power Lab, Refund Raleigh and Education Justice.
Manzoor Cheema, an organizer with Muslims for Social Justice and People’s Power Lab, said post-9/11 policies, that initially targeted Muslims have since expanded to affect immigrants of all backgrounds.
“Black, brown and Muslim community members are victims of frequent state-based injustices,” said Cheema, who has been active in the Triangle area for 25 years. “If you see an attack against one community member, you have to speak up, because next time it will be replicated to other people.” 
The organizations also call for ending U.S. military actions abroad, providing full funding for public services like schools, healthcare and housing.
Speakers also called out recent actions by the Trump administration, which has revoked the visas of more than a dozen international students across North Carolina.
 Nique Williams, representing Refund Raleigh, expressed solidarity with Palestinians and condemned what she said was U.S.-funded military operations. 
“We should be funding care. We should be funding love. We should be funding the needs of our people, instead of funding genocide and war,” Williams said. 
Preserving Palestinian identity through food
The organizers gathered at a new restaurant in Northeast Raleigh called Flip It! where Nahla Ahmad, owner of the seven-month-old restaurant, has made it her mission to educate people about Palestinian culture through food. “I want people to get to know the Palestinian culture, and I want people to know that Palestine existed,” said Ahmad.
Ahmad, who is 63 and has lived in the U.S. for 32 years, said her restaurant isn’t political but rather focused on preserving cultural identity.
The restaurant’s name comes from Maqluba, a traditional Palestinian dish literally meaning “upside down” served by flipping it so “the good stuff in the bottom comes on top.” It symbolizes Ahmad’s mission: turning perceptions about Palestinian culture right-side up. Each plate served, she said, is an invitation to understand a rich heritage she said is often misunderstood.
“We have been struggling for about 80 years just to make sure that people know that we are there. We have our own culture, our own food, our own country, and we are trying to spread the culture, the information about us so we can get as much support as we can.”
For Ahmad, this isn’t just about food. It’s about showing the world that Palestine is not just a place on a map, but a culture with deep roots and enduring spirit, she said. Through every plate of Maqluba turned upside down, Ahmad invites diners to flip their understanding—and truly see Palestine.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1804-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

(Photo provided by Free & Just)Even before federal abortion-rights protections were overturned three years ago, a Fargo mother says she had to travel hundreds of miles and across state lines to end a life-threatening pregnancy.
Randi Lamoureux, an educator and business owner, became pregnant with her son Lammy in 2017. At 19 weeks, he was diagnosed with a severe fetal abnormality called DiGeorge syndrome. Lamoureux’s doctor told her that both she and Lammy were at risk for cardiac arrest if she stayed pregnant.
Lamoureux said she had to travel more than 300 miles for care at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
By the time she could make the trip, she was almost too far along under that state’s law.
“That was literally the absolute last day that I could get it in Minnesota,” she said. “More than 24 hours later, I would have had to have gone to another state.”
More miscarriages criminally investigated three years into post-Dobbs abortion bans

Lamoureux said the weeks before and after were full of devastating decisions she never imagined having to make. 
“Do we hold our baby? Do we take pictures of our baby? Do we cremate him?” she said. “Those are things that nobody else should have a say in, ever.”
Though Lamoureux, born and raised in Grafton, is conservative and deeply religious, she said she wants other North Dakotans to see abortion not as a political or religious issue, but as a personal and private choice. No one can understand that decision until they’re faced with it, she said.
“I wish I could have invited Kevin Cramer into the hospital room when we had to make decisions,” she said of the U.S. senator from North Dakota.
Today, Lamoureux lives in Fargo with her husband and 5-year-old daughter. She said she now considers abortion-rights advocacy part of her life’s purpose.
“I don’t want my 5-year-old daughter or anybody else’s daughters or anybody else to have to go through what I went through,” she said.
Earlier this week, Lamoureux traveled to D.C. with a group of other women who have been impacted by state-level abortion policy. They were invited to share their stories at a summit organized by Free and Just, an abortion-rights group, to mark the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which gave rise to a patchwork of state abortion laws across the country. 
As part of the trip, Lamoureux said she went to the hill and met with members of Congress.
She said it felt good to share her story, but she can’t help but find it unfair that women like her have to recount such difficult experiences to try and shift policy. 
“To me, it’s like: Why? Why do we have to justify this? Why do we have to share our stories with anyone?” she said. “However, it’s the reality, and our stories are what make change.”
Lammy is still part of daily life for Lamoureux and her family. She said her parents recently visited his grave in Rochester.
“They called us, and we said a prayer together as a family,” Lamoureux said. “My parents left two little trucks for him and a sunflower.”
North Dakota Supreme Court hears arguments over abortion ban

Under a district court ruling last fall, abortion is legal in North Dakota through fetal viability, thought to be around 24 weeks, but no clinics provide abortion care in the state. 
North Dakota had adopted a law in 2023 banning all abortions except when the pregnancy poses a serious health risk to the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest in the first six weeks of pregnancy. That policy was struck down as unconstitutional last year by a District Court judge. The ruling was appealed to the North Dakota Supreme Court, which has yet to make a final decision in the case.
During the 2025 session, Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, introduced a bill he said sought to strike a compromise between reproductive freedom and regulation. It would have allowed women to receive abortions for any reason through week 15 of pregnancy, while medical professionals would decide whether to allow later term abortions on a case-by-case basis. The House overwhelmingly rejected the policy.
In a 2023 ruling striking down a previous state abortion ban, the North Dakota Supreme Court found that women have a fundamental right to seek abortions for health reasons. The justices also found that the state has a compelling interest in protecting unborn life. 
In a January opinion in the lawsuit, the state Supreme Court indicated that it may have to decide how to balance these interests as it considers the pending appeal over the state’s abortion law. It takes a fourth-fifths vote by the high court to declare a law unconstitutional in North Dakota.

(Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)As NATO wrapped up its latest summit in The Hague, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said he is not in favor of Ukraine joining the organization.
“I think that an attempt to do that would essentially make it almost 100% certain that you wouldn’t be able to find a peaceful resolution to the war,” McCormick said on Wednesday evening, during a telephone town hall meeting.
Ukraine joining NATO has been viewed as a red line for Russia, McCormick said. But, he added that he views Russia as the aggressor in the ongoing war. Multiple presidents have previously expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO including presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden.
However, President Donald Trump said in February that it is not practical.
More than 150,000 Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans live in Pennsylvania, making the Keystone State home to the second largest population in the country.

McCormick, a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, also suggested that Russia may be facing more sanctions from the U.S. in the near future.
“They haven’t been willing to come to the table,” McCormick said. “They keep playing games. They seem to suggest they’ll do a deal, and then they don’t.”
“I’ve signed on(to) a piece of legislation in the Senate that I suspect we’ll introduce, if there’s not progress in the next week or two, with a number of other senators, to put sanctions back on Russia,” he added. “We’ve got to have an end to the fighting, and part of that is Russia, I think, acting in a more responsible way about a peace agreement.”
The state’s junior senator also said he supports Trump’s outlined path in reaching an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Part of that, he noted, is Europe establishing a security arrangement for Ukraine to ensure that they will be protected against future aggression.
He celebrated NATO’s decision on Wednesday to invest 5% in defense spending, which is an increase from previous years.

“We should probably increase the funding for NIH”
Referring to Pennsylvania as one of the life sciences capitals of the world, McCormick said the country “should probably increase the funding for NIH (National Institute of Health), not lessen it” as cuts potentially loom via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“I don’t agree with what the policy has been on this, and I’ve expressed that to Secretary (Robert F.) Kennedy (Jr.) and others,” McCormick said.
He was responding to a constituent’s question who was concerned about a $5 million grant, aimed to pursue a cure for muscular dystrophy, potentially being pulled.

In February, the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) released a statement condemning the proposal to limit indirect costs to 15% of all grants.
“The neuromuscular disease community depends on a well-funded biomedical research ecosystem to discover breakthrough treatments and potential cures,” Donald S. Wood, PhD, President and CEO of Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), and Sharon Hesterlee, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of MDA said. “This is why MDA strongly condemns the National Institutes of Health’s policy guidance that all indirect costs will be capped at 15% in all grants. This arbitrary decision will prove catastrophic to neuromuscular disease research, and we call for NIH to immediately reverse this decision.”
McCormick said Pennsylvania is one of the biggest recipients of NIH funding in the nation, getting more than $1 billion a year that goes towards the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), University of Pennsylvania, Penn State Health, and other large hospitals, universities and research labs.
“It’s a huge issue in Pennsylvania,” he said.
McCormick said he doesn’t believe that cuts should be made to the grants that are in midstream where progress has been made.
“In many cases, people’s lives are dependent on this breakthrough kind of research,” he said. “I don’t think it makes sense to cut grants in midstream, even if the overhead numbers look too high.”
However, McCormick said these universities need to have more scrutiny. He thinks there should be a “very organized approach” to reviewing how NIH grants are given to ensure taxpayers money is being spent on “real good science research, which in most cases it is.”
McCormick said he had a call with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya last week and said they “see a lot of common ground on this” and is attempting to have him come to Pennsylvania for a visit.

“I’m wrestling with it myself,” McCormick says about AI regulations in BBB
A provision in the reconciliation bill, dubbed by Trump as the “Big Beautiful Bill,” would prohibit states from regulating artificial intelligence (AI) for the next 10 years.
“I’m not sure where the Senate version is going to land,” McCormick said. “I think this is going to be something that we’re going to be wrestling with in the Congress for the foreseeable future, because AI is changing so quickly that we’re not keeping up with it.”
McCormick said he’s sympathetic to the provision because some states put what he called, “extreme regulations in place.”
“So, the problem with letting states independently regulate AI is that you get this mishmash of regulations that can be very restrictive to innovation and very restrictive to successful business,” McCormick said. “My view on the AI arms race is that China is our biggest competitor, and the key to winning that battle is not trying to restrict AI so much as to win the innovation game.”
However, McCormick said the work needs to provide, “clear ethical boundaries and ethical frameworks and regulation.”
“I think the biggest fear is that we’re not going to innovate enough, and if we let states start to regulate AI, we’re going to really get in the way of innovation,” he said.
However, he said in some specific areas, it becomes “really problematic.” He cited the music industry around Nashville, Tennessee.
“Country music singers are super worried about AI being used to steal their content: artists, musicians, actors, are worried about AI undermining them,” McCormick said. “So, Tennessee might want to put in specific regulation to protect their music industry.”
“So, there’s a tension here on recognizing that you need specific protections for certain types of industries, and to ensure that AI doesn’t result in kind of mass stealing of intellectual property and so forth,” he added.
McCormick said he’s trying to spend a lot of time understanding AI and admitted most members of Congress probably don’t even understand it, as it is evolving rapidly.
While  the Republican was still weighing his options on that provision, he defended other parts of the reconciliation bill, including extending the Trump tax cuts put in place during the president’s previous term, and the spending levels for border security, defense, Medicaid, and SNAP.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1240736733-mccormick.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

A Source analysis of the Gila found the same.","The Whitewater-Baldy Complex Fire in Gila National Forest pictured at night in May 2012. A new study awaiting peer review from the Wilderness Society undercuts the United States Agriculture Department Secretary's claim that repealing the ""Roadless Rule"" will prevent wildfires. (Photo courtesy Gila National Forest)One big reason the United States Agriculture Department Secretary says she wants to strip protections for 58 million acres of federal forestland is to prevent wildfires, but a new study suggests allowing roads and logging into currently protected areas will do the opposite. 
A study from national environmentalist group The Wilderness Society concluded that more roads results in more wildfires, and said “roadless” areas that comprise roughly 30% of the nation’s federal forestland see far fewer wildfire starts. 
“Building roads into roadless areas is likely to result in more fires. These fires will, on average, be smaller than fires farther from roads, but there will be more of them, and some of them will grow to become large fires,” lead author Greg Aplet concluded in a two-page summary of the study findings. 
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins unveiled her agency’s plans earlier this week during the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in Santa Fe to repeal the “Roadless Rule,” protections implemented in 2011 aimed at preserving wild forests. She said the rule hampers forest management and wildfire prevention and also said repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.

The Wilderness Society study, completed last month, is still undergoing peer review, according to the organization. Its authors, who submitted it for publication in the Fire Ecology journal, looked at three decades of wildfire ignition data across all national forests to determine whether higher wildfire frequency was found within 50 meters of roads. 
The authors determined that wildfire-ignition density was more than three times lower in areas protected as “Inventoried Roadless Areas.” Specifically, those areas saw 1.9 fires per 1,000 hectares, which is about 4 square miles. The highest wildfire-ignition density occurred in areas within 50 meters on either side of a road, the authors found, where there were 7.4 fires per 1,000 hectares. 
The authors did the same analysis by region, and found wildfire density along roads in the Southwest ranked the highest in the country. Roughly 13 wildfires per 1,000 hectares occurred in this region, compared with roughly 3 wildfires per 1,000 hectares in “roadless areas.” 
A Source New Mexico analysis of wildfire ignitions in the Gila National Forest had similar findings. 
Since 2014, the earliest year ignition data from the National Interagency Wildfire Center is readily available, roughly 1,400 wildfires have ignited within Gila boundaries, according to Source’s analysis. Of them, about 15% ignited within “roadless” areas with strict prohibitions against road construction or reconstruction, which comprise 20% of the forest area. 
Particularly in the southern part of the Gila, wildfire starts over the last decade appear to cluster alongside roads, according to Source’s map below:


The biggest fire in the Gila’s recorded history and also the second-biggest fire in New Mexico history, the 320,000-acre Black Fire, did not start in a “roadless” area, according to the Source New Mexico analysis. The Trout Fire, which is currently burning in the Gila, also did not start in the “roadless” area.
On Tuesday, United States Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz issued a statement applauding Rollins’ move to repeal the “Roadless Rule.” 
“This decision would unlock 30% of the National Forest System, enabling common-sense forest management practices to strengthen the health and productivity of America’s forests,” he wrote. 
He characterized wildfires burning in “roadless” areas as increasingly destructive, thanks to overgrown and unmanaged forests that need to be thinned and accessible. 
“The forests we know today are not the same as the forests of 2001. They are dangerously overstocked and increasingly threatened by drought, insect-born disease, and wildfire. It’s time to turn the page on the Roadless Rule and return land management decisions where they belong – with local Forest Service experts who best understand their forests and communities,” he wrote. 
By the #s: Nearly a quarter of the Gila is protected as ‘roadless.’ Those protections could be nixed

Even though the study found that wildfires tend to grow larger if they ignite in “roadless areas,” doing so isn’t necessarily problematic, Aplet, the study’s lead author, told Source New Mexico on Thursday. By definition, “roadless” areas don’t have structures or other high value assets at risk, so often little reason exists to fully suppress wildfires that burn in wild forests, he said. 
Forest managers at the Gila in particular possess skill at allowing good fires to burn in the wilderness, Aplet said. 
“The managers on the Gila at least, have allowed fires to burn on the Gila more than most national forests, and so those forests are less altered than areas that have been logged or other national forests that haven’t been similarly managed,” Aplet said. “And so when fires do burn on the Gila wilderness and ‘roadless’ areas, they have a better effect than they do on other lands.”
Aplet said the study began back in President Donald Trump’s first term, when Utah leaders were considering seeking a statewide exemption to “Roadless Rule” protections, alleging that “roadless” areas were a fire threat. 
“This didn’t sound right to us, so we looked into the numbers,” Aplet said. 
The state stopped pursuing the waiver, so Aplet’s work stopped, but Trump’s re-election prompted authors to take up the issue again, he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/7355231410_2f3cb1f481_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

New Mexico Supreme Court asked to weigh in on Tesuque wastewater conflict

In an order issued last week, the New Mexico Supreme Court set a date for arguments on July 8.
The hearing allows the justices to ask questions of attorneys, said Tom Hnasko, an attorney representing residents, with a brief 20-minute window for arguments.
At the center of the dustup is the New Mexico Environment Department’s nod for a proposed permit for plans to dispose of treated wastewater from Bishop’s Lodge, a luxury resort, and adjacent homes.
The permit allows for the discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current state permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to dispose of about half that across two disposal fields on the property.
Residents objecting to the permit coalesced into the nonprofit Protect Tesuque, which claims the disposal method threatens to pollute drinking wells downstream. Tesuque Village, with a population of about 1,000 people, relies on private wells and septic tanks.
In April, attorneys representing Project Tesuque submitted an emergency petition that claimed  the state’s process amounted to a constitutional violation by unequally enforcing limitations in liquid waste laws between smaller and larger permits.
In court documents, The New Mexico Environment Department requested the court dismiss the proceedings, saying the claims did not meet the threshold of an emergency, needlessly interrupted the permitting process and that the water was treated to exceed state and federal quality standards.
“[Bishop’s Lodge] Santa Fe has the best available technology wastewater treatment facility on site that treats wastewater so thoroughly that the wastewater can be recycled and reused… to irrigate food crops,” the response stated.
Administrative proceedings for the permit’s approval started in May, but were delayed following an order from the New Mexico Supreme Court to pause the hearings until the court weighed in.

It has a young population and large family sizes. It boasts countless family-friendly events and attractions. And family values are — allegedly — at the center of its lawmakers’ decisions.
Unfortunately, our representatives are currently in the process of advancing a federal bill that would harm the most vulnerable families in our state. Republicans’ Big Beautiful Bill proposes scaling back key tax credits on which low-income families rely to make ends meet. But it’s not too late — while the bill passed in the U.S. House, our senators now have the opportunity to make changes and protect these vital tax credits.
I’m a sociologist at the University of Utah. I have spent my career examining how policies that were never really intended to improve health do so nevertheless. These include things like food assistance, minimum wage increases, and tax credits. We typically think about how these policies affect our wallets, but they also affect our bodies. They influence whether we can afford safe housing, adequate diets, regular health care, and other basic needs that shape our physical as well as mental health.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a popular, bipartisan program that puts much-needed cash back into the pockets of working families, but it also improves their health. Research has shown that moms who received the full EITC have better prenatal care, birth outcomes, and mental health compared to moms who did not. And children in households who received the full EITC are less likely than non-recipients to experience food insecurity, behavioral health problems, obesity, and childhood abuse and neglect.
But this bill would require families to “pre-certify” the children they claim each tax year. Already, approximately 1 in 5 families who are eligible for the EITC miss out because it’s too difficult to file for it, and “pre-certification” is another unnecessary piece of red tape that will deter even more families.
Meanwhile, the Child Tax Credit, which currently provides up to $2,000 per child, has also been shown to have significant health benefits for both parents and children. The Child Tax Credit improves well-being in similar ways to the EITC by giving families’ more financial breathing room.
Proposed changes to the CTC in this bill would leave many families behind. First, it would make millions of U.S. citizen children ineligible if at least one or both their parents are not U.S. citizens. Secondly, estimates project that 163,000 kids statewide would earn less than the full CTC because their parents’ income is too low, meaning that families with the most need won’t get the full amount. In my own Congressional district alone, UT-01, a total of 33,000 kids would be left behind.
Utah state legislators have already expressed some concern about the local impact of these restrictions, which function as a sort of marriage penalty and would hit many active-duty and veteran service members especially hard.
Some argue that cutting these tax credits is fine because honest work is enough for Americans to get by. But we know this is not the case for most families. My personal experience, which motivates my own research, corroborates this.
Growing up, my father worked tirelessly to provide a decent standard of living for our family through a combination of long hours, manual labor, and sheer will. By the time I was in middle school, it had begun to take its toll; the downturn in his health was rapid. My mother’s physical and mental health likewise began to suffer as she set to filling the economic gap that had opened with my dad’s failing health. This strain marred my childhood and undoubtedly contributed to parents’ early deaths at the ages of 58 and 60.
Utah is a place that promotes the ideal that “when families win, we all win — economically as well as socially.” Our elected officials, and the people who voted them in, should keep in mind the impact of these critical programs in the service of that family-friendly agenda and the health of Utah families",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sensoryexercises-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 13:10:14.663101

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.

Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


–  – Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Five and a half years after nurses launched a campaign to restore union representation at UW Health, the state’s highest court ruled Friday that the Madison-based hospital system has no obligation to collectively bargain with employees.
Act 10, the 2011 state law that stripped most union rights from public employees, also removed legal guarantees of union representation for University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority’s employees, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for a unanimous Court.
“When we examine the statutory language along with the statutory history, it is clear that Act 10 ended the collective bargaining requirements formerly placed on the Authority,” Hagedorn wrote.
The Court rejected the argument from Service Employees International Union (SEIU) that with the Act 10 changes, the hospital authority as a corporation fit the definition of “employer” under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act.
The Peace Act defines an employee as anyone working for hire other than an independent contractor and an employer as a person — including partnerships, corporations and some other legal entities — that engages the services of an employee.
The hospital authority doesn’t automatically meet that definition, however, Hagedorn wrote.
The hospital system was spun off from the University of Wisconsin in 1996 into a new “public body corporate and politic,” the UW Hospital and Clinics Authority. The hospital system’s employees were state employees represented by unions and with collective bargaining rights under Wisconsin’s state employment relations law.
The hospital authority “is not defined as a corporation,” Hagadorn wrote, “it is a ‘public body corporate and politic.’” He cited the Peace Act’s definition of “employer” that states the term does not include “the state or any political subdivision thereof.”
The 1996 law creating the new hospital authority removed its employees from the state employment relations law and added language specifying that the hospital authority was an employer under the Peace Act.
Act 10 changed that, Hagedorn wrote — repealing the hospital authority’s collective bargaining duty that was in the 1996 law as well as all other references to collective bargaining.
“In sum, Act 10 purged references to the Peace Act from the Authority Statute,” Hagedorn wrote.
“When it created the Authority, the legislature added the Authority as an employer under the Peace Act and imposed numerous other collective bargaining provisions. In Act 10, the legislature eliminated the Authority as a covered employer along with other collective bargaining requirements. We therefore hold that the Authority is no longer covered by the Peace Act and is not required to collectively bargain under the Peace Act.”
Friday’s ruling was the final stop for a case that started in September 2022. In an agreement brokered to avert a planned three-day strike by nurses demanding union recognition at UW Health, the hospital system and SEIU agreed to a joint petition to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC).
In the petition, the union argued that the hospital should be considered an employer under the Peace Act, while UW Health argued that Act 10 eliminated collective bargaining at the hospital system. WERC sided with UW Health, and Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost subsequently affirmed the employment commission’s conclusion.

Taylor. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a preliminary victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
In Pride month, transgender Marylanders reflect on strengths, weaknesses, of state protections

“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose—guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity.”

In a brisk nine-page ruling, the Superior Court judge concluded that the Milton lawsuit was very similar to a previous bundle of suits fighting the multi-family housing law and should be dismissed.
The post Superior Court tosses Milton taxpayer suit against MBTA Communities law appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OPPONENTS OF A PLAN to rezone the affluent Boston suburb of Milton spent weeks urging town voters and officials to pump the brakes while a court considered a suit challenging the MBTA Communities housing law. 
All the way up to a special Town Meeting in mid-June, a set of residents, planning board members, and warrant committee members tried to hold off a proposal that would allow for the potential to add 25 percent more total housing units, required by the state because of Milton’s proximity to public transit. Less than 10 days after Town Meeting voters moved ahead with a plan to comply anyway, Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea offered another firm rebuke to the naysayers.  
The 16 taxpayers who brought suit to halt local enforcement of the controversial MBTA Communities multi-family housing law lacked standing, Gildea found. The plaintiffs also did not convince the court that the state’s designation of the town as a “rapid transit community” was unreasonable, Gildea wrote in a crisp nine-page opinion handed down on June 26. 
He rejected the taxpayers’ request for an injunction and granted the state housing office’s motion to dismiss the suit. 
The conclusions Gildea reached in a June 6 order considering a bundle of town complaints about the MBTA Communities law “apply equally here,” he wrote, reiterating that the housing law is not an unfunded mandate. The taxpayers offered only speculative costs that they would have to bear if the town complied, Gildea said. The MBTA Communities law lays the groundwork for but does not require new construction, and Milton always has the option of pursuing state grants that already exist to fund infrastructure associated with new housing, he added. 
As to the third-rail of the entire Milton debate – whether the quaint Mattapan High-Speed Trolley should count as “rapid transit” in the same way that MBTA subway lines or the Silver Line bus does – Gildea needed barely 100 words to dispense with the matter. 
In the brief MBTA Communities statute, lawmakers made no mention of the Mattapan trolley, which the taxpayers argued meant that Milton is not a rapid transit community. Rather, they said, their more distant proximity to commuter rail or Red Line subway service should make them an “adjacent community.” That designation would require rezoning for only 10 percent more units – even less than the 15 percent required for commuter rail communities. 
Gildea agreed with the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities that “the mere use of a ‘rapid transit’ category is not arbitrary and capricious simply because that category is not found in [the law],” he wrote. The specific language of an “adjacent community” is also not found in the law, he added. 
The way that the housing office created its four community categories applied its “substantive expertise” to tailor the regulations to fit the real-word conditions of each MBTA community, Gildea said, just as the state Supreme Judicial Court ordered in January. 
“For a second time this month, the courts affirmed the intent of the MBTA Communities Law, which is to increase housing production to address one of the greatest challenges facing the people of Massachusetts – high costs,” said Ed Augustus, secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, in a statement Friday. He noted that nearly 80 percent of MBTA Communities “have already said yes to multifamily housing to bring down costs for all residents, and we continue to work closely with communities that have yet to do so.”  
As the judge tasked with overseeing the many MBTA Communities lawsuits, Gildea’s Thursday ruling might yet be appealed but severely narrows the likelihood that any of the other suits before him will be positively received at the Superior Court level. As lawmakers suggested during the Milton debate, this dispute may now rest in the hands of the same legislators who signed off on the sweeping policy change in the first place.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Americans have long enjoyed the practical and romantic aspects of the West. The West has provided us with minerals, timber, energy and space to roam freely for generations. We have a wonderful asset in the West — our public lands — which are owned by the people of the United States and held in trust for us by the federal government. Anybody can go out there and recreate, for free, any time, and that is a good thing for all of us.
Congress previously recognized the value of the public lands, declaring that these lands would remain in public ownership in an act known as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management are each commissioned in FLPMA to allow a variety of uses on their managed lands. Most of the public land in the West is thus managed under a nonexclusive shared-use arrangement. Lands for grazing, mining and logging — or all three — typically remain open to the public for hiking, hunting and camping.
Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill

“Multiple use” is defined as “management of the public lands and their various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people.” FLPMA addresses topics such as land use planning, land acquisition, fees and payments, administration of federal land, range management, and rights-of-way on federal land. Local communities are empowered to ask for transfers to accommodate growth patterns.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has proposed significant changes to the manner in which public lands are sold. He seeks congressional action to bypass FLPMA and its requirements, instead claiming that the “housing crisis” can be eased if only the federal government will sell off millions of acres of public land to developers. That’s nonsense, and those proposals have drawn significant criticism for good reasons.
Previous homestead acts have done much to foster private land ownership in the U.S. Those effects are undeniably positive. But Sen. Lee’s proposal isn’t a homestead act, and it fails to take into account that the land in the West which is capable of human habitation has by and large already been claimed. There’s little water, even less infrastructure and where those shortfalls can be blunted, the cost of developing housing in those locations is significantly higher than in already settled areas. Think of the expense of drilling (and maintaining) a fresh water well for each home, along with the needs for electricity, telecommunications, solid and liquid waste, and you can easily determine that further developing wild land for housing results in costs that can’t be recovered.
Further, Sen. Lee’s proposals have not been subjected to hearings or formal input as he seeks to put them in the One Big Beautiful (budget reconciliation) Bill currently under consideration in Congress. While it’s true that the Senate parliamentarian ruled the Lee Amendment out of order with respect to that bill, Sen. Lee continues to push his proposal in the media, and in Congress. Senators Thune and Rounds have not declared their positions on his proposal to my knowledge. While maps show that South Dakota does not have any parcels for sale, Lee’s original proposal put parcels in the Wyoming Black Hills on the chopping block. Lee has since said he would alter the proposal to include only Bureau of Land Management land within 5 miles of a population center and exempt U.S. Forest Service lands altogether.
Americans need space to be free, and fortunately we have it still. We need wild spaces in America to allow for the continuation of the frontier spirit that made us who we are as a people.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court unexpectedly announced it will not rule on Louisiana’s congressional redistricting case this term, instead scheduling it for further arguments in the fall. 
The case, Callais v. Louisiana, involves non-Black voters who sued over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. Justices said they will issue an order specifying additional questions it wants addressed before they revisit the case later this year. 
“Although we hoped for a decision this term, we welcome a further opportunity to present argument to the Court regarding the state’s impossible task of complying with the Court’s voting precedents,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement to the Illuminator.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative who has served on the court since 1991 when he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, issued a dissenting statement, arguing the court has a responsibility to act promptly. 
By delaying a decision, which isn’t likely to come until next spring, the court all but ensured a new congressional map, if necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election and until the 2030 census cycle is underway.

“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Those were my mother’s words to me as we stood in the hallway of my parents’ home in Leland in 2008. At the time, I was a 20-year-old college student, home that weekend from Ole Miss.
My mother had sensed that I had been growing distant, reluctant to talk to her on the phone, and pulling away generally from my family. She knew — as mothers often know — that to become fully myself I thought I needed to leave my family behind. I thought they wouldn’t understand.
She stopped me in the hallway and asked what seemed like a simple question: “Eric, are you gay?” In the ensuing conversation, I officially came out to my mother, who like my father, brother and sister, had known all along. Though she was not surprised by the confirmed knowledge of her middle child being gay, what she said next surprised me. “I don’t want you to have a hard life.”
I recoiled from her words at that moment. I did not appreciate the link she made between me being gay and my life being harder as a result. Knowing her work in healthcare, I did not appreciate what I assumed was her subtle link between being gay and adverse health outcomes. I wanted to believe then — as I still do now — that to be gay does not immediately equate a harder life. I wasn’t naive enough to think that life wasn’t hard, but I believed in my bones that the fact of one’s sexuality shouldn’t be a primary reason for it. I believed that to be gay was no different than one’s eye color or height: an inescapable and unavoidable biological fact.

Since that 2008 conversation, living an “out” life seems to have gotten a bit easier as reflected in national numbers. A 2024 Gallup poll found that nearly one in 10 Americans identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. All in all, in the 12 years that Gallup has tracked LGBTQ+ identification in the United States, the rate of self-identification has nearly tripled.
While there are various explanations for this statistical change, many queer people prior to this administration believed our lives would not be made harder by being who we are and living our lives openly and authentically.
These national numbers reverberate locally. Recent numbers indicate that there are 93,300 LGBTQ+ adults in Mississippi, around 4.1% of the state’s total population. Further, despite a history of exclusion, LGBTQ+ folks in Mississippi raise and sustain families.
In a 2022 article for Mississippi Today, Nigel Dent related how “the percentage of same-sex parents in Mississippi is higher than the nation at 25.7% in Mississippi versus 17.2% nationally.” In 2022, Mississippi had the nation’s highest rate of same-sex couples raising children, an inversion of statistical realities that often place our state at the bottom of lists. The unexpected fact that same-sex couples in Mississippi are raising families at such rates should be a banner of pride for our state.
Mississippi is not an anomaly in the South. In 2023, the Williams Institute found that 35.9% of all of those who identify as LGBT (the center’s chosen acronym), more than five million people, live in the U.S. Southeast, more than any other region in the country. Chances are most Southerners today know someone who is lesbian or gay or bisexual or transgender. Beyond those of us who are LGBTQ+ in Mississippi, many of us have brothers or sons, sisters or daughters, mothers or fathers, cousins or chosen kin, who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer.
LGBTQ+ Mississippians are woven into the fabric of many of our daily lives, contributing to our economy, our culture, our sense of place, our ideas of community, family and home. The rainbow connection we create is being felt across the state.
In Jackson, Mississippi Capital City Pride hosts year-round events covering the state’s queer history and culture and the Jack Myers house opened in 2024 as the first LGBTQIA+ shelter in Mississippi. Since 2008, Tupelo has hosted a Pride parade as does the Biloxi-based Gulf Coast Association of Pride.
College towns such as Hattiesburg (Pine Belt Pride), Oxford (Oxford Pride), and Starkville (Starkville Pride) also host annual pride events and year-round programming. I attended this year’s Oxford Pride, where hundreds marched in full technicolor despite changing political dynamics and institutional support. In Water Valley, Violet Valley Bookstore is one of the nation’s most revered LGBTQ+ independent bookstores and is annually featured in a graphic from Oprah Daily.
Across many fields and walks of life, we are shaping our home state, creating and making the lives of all Mississippians better, easier, more beautiful and fulfilling. Why would we want to listen to rhetoric and support policy that makes the lives of any group of Mississippians harder? Why would we want to make the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians harder? Why would you want to make your son’s or your daughter’s or your friend’s or your co-worker’s life harder? What purpose does that serve? Whose purposes does it serve?
Today politicians across the country feel emboldened to advocate to make my life and the lives of folks like me harder in this politically divisive moment. Political leaders are positioning themselves to pass legislation that would strip away rights already codified and set a foundation for further intrusion into the lives and freedoms of LGBTQ+ Americans.
The following is but a sampling of our current moment: on March 8, 2025, Donald Trump posted a crossed-out pink triangle on his Truth Social, evoking the Nazi persecution of gay men. Republican leaders in five states—Michigan, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota—have suggested the Supreme Court overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage. Idaho and North Dakota have already passed such legislation. Four additional states—Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas—have introduced legislation that would create a separate category of legal marriage called “covenant marriage,” that could only take place between a man and a woman.
On June 10, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the US, approved a resolution calling for the overturning of Obergefell as they deem it “def[ies] God’s design for marriage and family.”
Executive orders have forced the National Park Service to remove “transgender” and “queer” from the Stonewall monument website irrespective of any consideration of the historic facts pertaining to that site. Transgender flags are no longer allowed at Stonewall “officially,” though visitors continue to bring trans flags to leave at the site.
With the fate of Medicaid in limbo, some insurance companies now feel comfortable denying coverage for PrEP, or Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, a routine treatment that significantly lessens one’s risk of contracting HIV. With the defunding of the federal USAID and PEPFAR in the balance, access to HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention protocols has been interrupted globally.
As with any virus, HIV does not discriminate based upon gender or sexual identity, and an HIV diagnosis, while no longer fatal for most in the United States, does indeed make life more difficult for whoever it impacts.
Under the new leadership of Kristi Noem, Homeland Security has quietly moved to eliminate a ban on surveillance based on sexual orientation and gender identity leading many to speculate that the agency will now increase targeted surveillance on gender and sexual minorities.
Finally, executive orders, policy reversals and legislation targeting trans Americans are too many for one list to capture. Regarding the executive order against trans people serving in the US Military and using the pronouns of their choice in such service, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes called the policy “unadulterated animus.” Absolute hostility: a policy reversal that exists for no other reason than for one group to be hostile toward another group of fellow Americans.
Aren’t we better than this?
In Mississippi, some state officials continue to vilify groups of fellow Mississippians without regard for expertise or diligently consulting established facts on a given issue. Adding fuel to the flames of anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment without any grounding in evidence, such leaders strive to make the lives of a group of fellow Mississippians harder for no other reason than political utility.
What tangible benefit is there for a straight Mississippian to tell a trans Mississippian that they don’t exist? There is none. It is the politics of cruelty, plain and simple, a refusal, as Jane Fonda stated at the SAG awards earlier this year, to “give a damn” about someone different from you.
In Mississippi, only five cities — Clarksdale, Holly Springs, Jackson, Magnolia, Rosedale — and no county have passed ordinances to protect LGBTQ+ Mississippians from discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. If federal mandates are removed or held in the limbo of ongoing legal challenges, then, only 6% of LGBTQ+ Mississippians will be protected from discrimination under local law.
With recent rhetoric and proposed actions from federal and local governments, one can only imagine how the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians may be about to get harder. And to be clear, some folks within our community will be hit harder than others.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Seventeen years later, I understand now where my mom was coming from. She was coming from a place of care and concern for her child. Her words were not about who her son was but who other people were. She knew in her wisdom and experience that she would not be able to control how my life would be made manifestly more difficult by the actions of others who did not see, love and know me as unconditionally as she did. She knew people feared what they could not understand and that the so-called “marginal” among us will always be our most vulnerable.
My mother has been a healthcare provider since she was 15 years old in our native Mississippi Delta. She has often repeated a mantra attributed to Hippocrates, known best to us as the author of the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm. In a medical setting, such advice is often more idealistic than practical. Doctors and nurses must often react to extraordinary situations comparing risk and benefit for a myriad of treatments. Many treatments — such as those for cancer — often cause significant short-term harm in service of hoped-for long-term healing.
But the point is that many healthcare providers like my mother operate under the basic assumption that they should not cause further harm to their patients. That to heal, one must first aim not to make the problem worse.
I’ve been thinking in the last few months of the words harm and hard in conjunction. What if we simply told our politicians and representatives not to make it harder? No matter what you do — no matter what mistakes you may make in the process — no matter what ideological system aligns with your personal values — no matter from whom comes your campaign financing — no matter what your political party — can you first promise to not make it harder for any of us?
Can that be your first guiding principle and most basic commitment to all of your constituents? It would be nice to believe that public servants get into that line of work because they already adhere to that foundational ethic.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Life is hard. I know of few people from all walks of life who have not gone through hard times. But we should expect our leaders not to go out of their way to make it harder for any one of us.
We should hold our leaders accountable when they attempt to target any group of us in ways that will make life harder for that group and, by the way, do little if anything at all to benefit those of us who are not in the targeted, oft-marginalized, group.
As a native Mississippian, my life hasn’t always been easy. But who I am in my full authenticity has prepared me to weather the hard times and cherish the easy ones.
In March of 2025, I attended my cousin’s marriage in Pass Christian; there, she married her long-term boyfriend. The weekend after, my partner and I attended his cousin’s marriage in Georgia. There, his cousin married his long-term girlfriend. Two straight-marriages in two weekends. Good times. Easy times. Fun times. Family time.
When I was growing up, I never dreamed that the legal path for me to marry the man I now call my partner would be as easy as it has been since 2015, since the Obergefell ruling. As my partner and I watched our cousins walk down the aisle to meet their beloveds and commit to them to weather life’s storms, for better or for worse, I prayed that option remains viable for us, two men who by the grace of God found each other. I pray, too, that marriage remains a legal option for all couples like us well into our nation’s future. Life is so much easier when you walk it with someone you love by your side. Love should be enough.
In 2008, a few months after I officially came out to my mother in that hallway conversation, my older sister got married. The easiest conversation I ever had about being gay was with my sister. The conversation was easy because it never took place. My sister knew; she knows. And yet, she didn’t need me to go through the hard part — the difficult step — of having that conversation where I described my supposed difference in contrast to her assumed normalcy.
My sister made it easy because all that mattered to her is that I’m her younger brother. For her, that was, and is, enough. No need to make it any harder than that.

Federal scientists released their annual forecast for Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms on June 26, 2025, and they expect a mild to moderate season. However, anyone who comes in contact with the blooms can face health risks, and it’s worth remembering that 2014, when toxins from algae blooms contaminated the water supply in Toledo, Ohio, was considered a moderate year, too.
The Conversation asked Gregory J. Dick, who leads the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, a federally funded center at the University of Michigan that studies harmful algal blooms among other Great Lakes issues, why they’re such a concern.

bulletin_current 
1. What causes harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are dense patches of excessive algae growth that can occur in any type of water body, including ponds, reservoirs, rivers, lakes and oceans. When you see them in freshwater, you’re typically seeing cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae.
These photosynthetic bacteria have inhabited our planet for billions of years. In fact, they were responsible for oxygenating Earth’s atmosphere, which enabled plant and animal life as we know it.

Algae are natural components of ecosystems, but they cause trouble when they proliferate to high densities, creating what we call blooms.
Harmful algal blooms form scums at the water surface and produce toxins that can harm ecosystems, water quality and human health. They have been reported in all 50 U.S. states, all five Great Lakes and nearly every country around the world. Blue-green algae blooms are becoming more common in inland waters.
The main sources of harmful algal blooms are excess nutrients in the water, typically phosphorus and nitrogen.
Historically, these excess nutrients mainly came from sewage and phosphorus-based detergents used in laundry machines and dishwashers that ended up in waterways. U.S. environmental laws in the early 1970s addressed this by requiring sewage treatment and banning phosphorus detergents, with spectacular success.
How pollution affected Lake Erie in the 1960s, before clean water regulations.
Today, agriculture is the main source of excess nutrients from chemical fertilizer or manure applied to farm fields to grow crops. Rainstorms wash these nutrients into streams and rivers that deliver them to lakes and coastal areas, where they fertilize algal blooms. In the U.S., most of these nutrients come from industrial-scale corn production, which is largely used as animal feed or to produce ethanol for gasoline.
Climate change also exacerbates the problem in two ways. First, cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures. Second, climate-driven increases in precipitation, especially large storms, cause more nutrient runoff that has led to record-setting blooms.

2. What does your team’s DNA testing tell us about Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms contain a mixture of cyanobacterial species that can produce an array of different toxins, many of which are still being discovered.
When my colleagues and I recently sequenced DNA from Lake Erie water, we found new types of microcystins, the notorious toxins that were responsible for contaminating Toledo’s drinking water supply in 2014.
These novel molecules cannot be detected with traditional methods and show some signs of causing toxicity, though further studies are needed to confirm their human health effects.
We also found organisms responsible for producing saxitoxin, a potent neurotoxin that is well known for causing paralytic shellfish poisoning on the Pacific Coast of North America and elsewhere.
Saxitoxins have been detected at low concentrations in the Great Lakes for some time, but the recent discovery of hot spots of genes that make the toxin makes them an emerging concern.
Our research suggests warmer water temperatures could boost its production, which raises concerns that saxitoxin will become more prevalent with climate change. However, the controls on toxin production are complex, and more research is needed to test this hypothesis. Federal monitoring programs are essential for tracking and understanding emerging threats.
3. Should people worry about these blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are unsightly and smelly, making them a concern for recreation, property values and businesses. They can disrupt food webs and harm aquatic life, though a recent study suggested that their effects on the Lake Erie food web so far are not substantial.
But the biggest impact is from the toxins these algae produce that are harmful to humans and lethal to pets.
The toxins can cause acute health problems such as gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, fever and skin irritation. Dogs can die from ingesting lake water with harmful algal blooms. Emerging science suggests that long-term exposure to harmful algal blooms, for example over months or years, can cause or exacerbate chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems and may be linked to liver cancers, kidney disease and neurological issues.

In addition to exposure through direct ingestion or skin contact, recent research also indicates that inhaling toxins that get into the air may harm health, raising concerns for coastal residents and boaters, but more research is needed to understand the risks.
The Toledo drinking water crisis of 2014 illustrated the vast potential for algal blooms to cause harm in the Great Lakes. Toxins infiltrated the drinking water system and were detected in processed municipal water, resulting in a three-day “do not drink” advisory. The episode affected residents, hospitals and businesses, and it ultimately cost the city an estimated US$65 million.
4. Blooms seem to be starting earlier in the year and lasting longer – why is that happening?
Warmer waters are extending the duration of the blooms.
In 2025, NOAA detected these toxins in Lake Erie on April 28, earlier than ever before. The 2022 bloom in Lake Erie persisted into November, which is rare if not unprecedented.
Scientific studies of western Lake Erie show that the potential cyanobacterial growth rate has increased by up to 30% and the length of the bloom season has expanded by up to a month from 1995 to 2022, especially in warmer, shallow waters. These results are consistent with our understanding of cyanobacterial physiology: Blooms like it hot – cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures.
5. What can be done to reduce the likelihood of algal blooms in the future?
The best and perhaps only hope of reducing the size and occurrence of harmful algal blooms is to reduce the amount of nutrients reaching the Great Lakes.
In Lake Erie, where nutrients come primarily from agriculture, that means improving agricultural practices and restoring wetlands to reduce the amount of nutrients flowing off of farm fields and into the lake. Early indications suggest that Ohio’s H2Ohio program, which works with farmers to reduce runoff, is making some gains in this regard, but future funding for H2Ohio is uncertain.
In places like Lake Superior, where harmful algal blooms appear to be driven by climate change, the solution likely requires halting and reversing the rapid human-driven increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Although data on pet intake fluctuates, some shelters in South Carolina are currently so overcrowded that officials are reporting “crisis” levels.
Fostering, or providing temporary care for, is a great way to give pets a break from shelter life. Plus, fostering “also relieves pressure on shelters and rescues, allowing these organizations to help more pets in need,” says Pedigree Foundation.
Pets at shelters can range from puppies to dogs rescued from illegal and “barbaric” dog fighting rings. Fostering helps prepare all of them for adoption.
Fostering opportunities are available year-round.

But every June — National Foster a Pet Month — there’s a push to get more pet lovers to temporarily look after companion animals.
For years I fostered dogs. I cared for young dogs, senior dogs, and everything in between.
One of the dogs I fostered was Jeriko:. “J” loved my bathroom mat. Even though I made a comfortable space for him in the living room, he’d always return to the bathroom to lie on that mat. “J” showed me that dogs have preferences.
When he was adopted, I bought him the same mat to take with him to his “forever home.”
I also fostered Misty.
During the time I was caring for her, I asked a friend to look after Misty while I took a short vacation. When my friend came to the house to pick her up, Misty started doing “the zoomies.”
Misty was so excited that she ran in circles. She reminded me that dogs are expressive. Misty really liked my friend, and she showed it. In no time, my friend’s family fell in love with Misty and adopted her.

Then, there’s Arthur.
I first saw Arthur when I was pulling up to the shelter’s parking lot. I was returning a crate that belonged to them, and I saw a volunteer walking him back to the building. I thought, “This dog shouldn’t be here.” Arthur’s missing one of his legs.
The next day I called the shelter to see if Arthur was still there. He was. I picked him up, and he became my next foster.
When Arthur arrived home, I let him lie down on the couch and I sat next to him. He quickly got up and dropped on my lap. He showed me that dogs just want to be loved.
I quickly fell in love with Arthur and adopted him — “foster to forever.”
People frequently ask me about Arthur. Does he need a prosthetic? No. Is he ill? No. I like when people ask so they discard misinformed or preconceived ideas about dogs with special needs. Anyone who’s met Arthur knows he’s passionate about tennis balls, and he loves to run — even hop — to catch them.
Sometimes dogs who’ve spent time at a shelter are misunderstood.
Once while walking Misty, a neighbor saw us and said he couldn’t be near pit bulls. Misty’s a pit bull mix. I reminded the neighbor that breedism is a form of racism. He’d never spent time with Misty, so he didn’t know that she’s calm and affectionate. If he’d given Misty a chance, he wouldn’t have judged her just by her appearance.
Animals don’t judge us, so let’s not judge them.
By fostering and getting to know companion animals, we can inform potential adopters about their personalities. This increases their chances of getting adopted.
Saying goodbye once they’d been adopted always made me cry. I laughed and learned with them, and it was impossible not to get attached.
People sometimes said, “I couldn’t foster. It’d be too painful.” But to me it was simple. I could cry from joy that they’d found a safe and loving home. Or I could do nothing.
Fostering is flexible and varies.
There are hundreds of shelters across South Carolina, and they’ll help coordinate a schedule that works well for everyone.
Fostering can last for a few weeks or be as short as an afternoon walk. But regardless of the amount of time given, the benefits are manifold.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 15:29:22+00:00,CT Mirror,Avelo deportation flights prompt bill on jet fuel tax exemptions,Adam Walker | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/avelo-deportation-flights-jet-fuel-tax-bill/,William Tong joined a virtual press conference announcing a proposal to cut jet fuel tax breaks for airlines involved in deportation flights.,"In a growing effort to hold airlines like Avelo accountable for their role in controversial deportation flights, New York State Sen. Patricia Fahy is spearheading legislation that would revoke millions of dollars in jet fuel tax exemptions from carriers found to be violating civil liberties.
Fahy unveiled details of the proposal during a virtual press conference Wednesday, hosted by a national group called Coalition to Stop Avelo. 
The conference featured Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and advocates from across the country pressing for transparency and action against Avelo Airlines, which activists say is profiting from deportation flights contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
New Haven has been an epicenter for the boycott movement against Avelo, as the budget airline flies 30 passenger-travel direct routes from Tweed New Haven Airport, even as it’s spent the past nearly two months running deportation flights from a separate airport in Arizona.
The airline, facing financial pressures, has defended its DHS partnership as necessary at a time of increased competition to its New Haven passenger-travel business. Activists and officials from across Connecticut and the country have continued to criticize Avelo’s role in migrant removals.

Meanwhile, at Wednesday’s online press conference, Fahy, who represents Albany in the New York State Senate, explained the rationale behind her new legislative proposal. ​“It’s leveraging our proprietary authority over public airport contracts here in New York to say that it is part of the state oversight contractual authority that airlines have to uphold Constitutional rights,” she said.
Fahy’s bill targets New York’s jet fuel tax exemption — described by Fahy as ​“very, very generous” — that saves airlines between $11 million and $17 million statewide each year. Under the proposal, airlines engaged in deportation flights that undermine due process would lose that tax benefit. 
The legislation, titled the State Airport Facilities Enforcing Accountability in Immigration Removals (SAFE AIR) Act, aims to ensure that no state agency, department, or locality in New York enters into or renews contracts with airlines that transport individuals detained for deportation without a valid judicial warrant or order from a federal judge or magistrate — not merely an administrative immigration detainer — and proof that the individual has been afforded due process rights, including access to counsel and a hearing before an immigration judge.
Introduced in May, the bill is currently under consideration in the New York State Senate’s Committee on Procurement and Contracts. It has not yet passed. 
The SAFE AIR Act would also amend state tax law to deny fuel tax exemptions to airlines that fail to meet these standards, while protecting carriers that comply with valid court orders or lawful federal mandates. It empowers the state attorney general to seek injunctive relief or civil penalties against violators. 
“This is the first private-sector contract we’re aware of between ICE and a commercial airline,” Fahy said, referring to Avelo’s alleged cooperation with DHS. ​“If they’re violating civil liberties, they shouldn’t get a break from New York taxpayers.” (Avelo has also been the beneficiary of a Connecticut state aviation fuel tax break.)
During his remarks at Wednesday’s presser, Connecticut Attorney General Tong echoed Fahy’s stance, urging states to reconsider economic support for companies engaged in harmful practices. 
Tong said Avelo refused to provide information about its relationship with DHS and instead told the state to file a Freedom of Information Act request — a response he called dismissive of a state that has offered the airline significant support. He also criticized Avelo’s claim that working with DHS is essential to its survival, arguing no business model should depend on profiting from others’ suffering.
“When I heard what Avelo is doing to immigrants and families in total violation of the law and without regard to due process — and if Avelo says, ​‘Well, that’s not us, that’s DHS, that’s ICE.’ No, sorry. You’re part of the deal, too,” Tong said.
“We are considering all of our legal options and legislative options to get more information, number one,” Tong added, ​“and if we’re unhappy with what we see and understand from Avelo, to not do business with them and not to be their partner.”
When asked about the criticism, Avelo spokesperson Courtney Goff wrote to the Independent Wednesday, ​“We recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and assert their freedom of speech. Avelo’s main priority continues to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation that over 7.3 million Customers across the country continue to enjoy.”
The press conference, organized by the Coalition to Stop Avelo, highlighted the growing grassroots and legislative movement opposing the use of commercial airlines in deportation operations. Advocates from Delaware, Michigan, Tennessee, and other states joined Fahy and Tong in calling for stronger accountability measures and the end of taxpayer subsidies for airlines tied to immigration enforcement. 
The Coalition continues to coordinate protests, boycotts, and legislative campaigns nationwide, with new local actions planned in the coming weeks to pressure airlines, investors, and public officials, including protests set to take place this weekend in states such as New York, Florida, and Michigan.

Wes Moore (D) is turning to a strategist with close ties to a potential rival in the 2028 White House election to helm his 2026 reelection campaign in Maryland – and possibly a national campaign beyond that.
Moore has hired Ron Owens, a Michigander who has worked as a political operative and statehouse aide for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) to run his reelection campaign.
Many Democrats – in Moore’s political orbit and beyond – had expected Ned Miller, who ran Moore’s 2022 campaign, joined his administration and later oversaw his super PAC, to head the reelection effort. But Miller has moved to Georgia, to run former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ 2026 campaign for governor.
“I’m thrilled to have Ron Owens leading our reelection campaign as our campaign manager,” Moore said in a statement provided to Maryland Matters. “Ron brings immense experience to Maryland from his work all across the country – with him on our team we will create the most aggressive statewide operation in history to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot all across Maryland.”
Though only 29, Owens is a seasoned operative who worked most recently as a campaign adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, helping Democratic Senate candidates, including now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), with strategy and campaign management.
In 2023, he was campaign manager to Brandon Presley, a former state utility regulator – and cousin of Elvis Presley’s – who was the Democratic nominee for governor of Mississippi. Presley ran a surprisingly strong race in a red state, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves by just 3.2 points.
Most of Owens’ political experience, however, is in Michigan, his home state. After a stint as a legislative aide to the state House Democratic leader, Owens was the deputy political director on Whitmer’s successful 2018 campaign for governor.
He spent two years as Whitmer’s public affairs specialist in her gubernatorial office, then was political director in her 2022 reelection campaign.
After Owens was hired to run Presley’s campaign, a leading Mississippi Republican cited the operative’s ties to Whitmer as a way of blasting the Democratic contender.
“COVID showed Americans that it certainly matters who serves as governor,” Henry Barbour, the Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, told the Magnolia Tribune in 2023. “Democrats such as Gretchen Whitmer advanced their elitist, government-knows-best agenda that restricted Americans’ liberty. And Brandon Presley hired her top political operative.
“Don’t believe him for a minute when he tries to persuade you he’s not of the same political persuasion,” Barbour said.
Whitmer and Moore are both seen as top-tier potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. But while Whitmer is termed out of office at the end of 2026, Moore must first win reelection next year before he can fully focus on any hypothetical national campaign.
Still, in the early skirmishing leading up to the 2028 White House primaries, Owens’ decision to cast his lot with Moore, one of Whitmer’s potential rivals, is noteworthy, if only significant to insiders.
In a 2018 interview, Owens highlighted his work ethic and life philosophy.
“One thing that my mom instilled in my siblings and me was to, one, always be kind to other people, two, always work twice as hard as anyone else and, three, whenever you’re working you should always be doing something that is benefiting others,” Owens said in an nterview with Pride Source, a Michigan LGBTQ+ publication.
“We are fortunate to have him as our leader as we seek to continue our mission to create a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said.
At this stage, Moore still has a pretty skeletal campaign operation as the 2026 election ramps up, though that is likely to change soon. But he will enter a potentially perilous campaign season without Miller, who, after guiding the governor’s first statewide campaign, became a senior adviser and director of engagement for his administration.
In the middle of last year, Miller left state government to oversee Moore’s Unity First PAC and also played a leadership role in Freedom in Reproduction – Maryland Inc., the entity that helped pass the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Moore appears to have also lost the services of his finance director, Patrick Denny, who was with the campaign since 2021.
The Moore campaign has not yet indicated who will replace Denny as finance director and it is not known who will oversee the governor’s PAC, which he largely used during the 2024 election cycle to attack Republican congressional candidates in Maryland. The PAC is now airing ads touting Moore’s economic record.
Even though he has publicly insisted in recent weeks that he is not running for president in 2028, Moore continues to behave like a possible national candidate. His trip in late May to South Carolina, site of an early and critical presidential primary, won wide attention from national political insiders and commentators.
Strategists on the popular “Hacks on Tap” podcast subsequently called Moore a “top 10” contender for 2028, and Chuck Todd, the former political director of NBC News, recently opined that Moore has the strongest resume and most gold-plated Rolodex of any of the hypothetical Democratic presidential candidates.
Moore appeared last week as a guest on “Pod Save America,” the breezy podcast hosted by former Obama administration officials. There, he explained why he’s not making plans to run for president, saying he never anticipated a career in politics and is enjoying serving as governor after starting the 2022 campaign as a relative unknown.
“I’m playing with house money right now and I love the work we’re doing in Maryland,” he said. The governor added that he will “go anywhere and everywhere” to tout the state’s progress.
 Bold-faced names

Moore’s out-of-state travels continue this month, and include a recent gathering with Democrats in Virginia, which is holding closely watched statewide elections this year.
Moore is headed to a fundraising brunch in Aspen, Colorado,on Saturday, hosted by Damian O’Doherty, the former Maryland political operative and co-founder of KO Public Affairs in Baltimore, who lives now in the Rocky Mountains but often returns to his home state.
The host committee of the event, which O’Doherty has informally dubbed “A Whole Lotta Skiers For Maryland Governor Wes Moore,” includes David Baugh, the executive director of the Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club, and a former superintendent of the Aspen School District; Rich Benenson, managing partner of the Denver office of the law firm and lobbying powerhouse Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; Gordon Bronson, chief business officer at Continuum Partners, a real estate development and financing firm; Adam Goers, a former Democratic operative with ties to former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and now the Denver-based senior vice president for corporate affairs for Columbia Care, a cannabis company; and Michael Stratton, a senior Colorado-based Democratic and corporate strategist.
Moore’s fundraiser in Colorado coincides with the Aspen Ideas Festival, the signature annual event of the Aspen Institute. According to the festival website, the confab “brings brilliant minds from around the globe to discuss the ideas that will shape tomorrow and help us understand today. From sunup to sundown, we’ll explore critical issues and uncover ideas that spark wonder.”
The festival schedule shows Moore discussing “bold, purposeful leadership” on Saturday afternoon with Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, moderated by CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.
“Big thinkers and doers share fresh ideas, challenge assumptions and ignite conversations that ripple far beyond [the Aspen conference venue],” the conference website says of the panel discussion with Moore and the other dignitaries. “Curiosity required.”
Moore is then scheduled to travel to Detroit, where he will deliver the keynote address at the Detroit NAACP’s 70th anniversary dinner on Sunday evening. That appearance was first reported by Politico.

What’s changed?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/ct-cannabis-marijuana-sales-recreational-medical/,"As sales of recreational marijuana have increased in CT, sales of medical cannabis have dropped, and overall sales have held fairly steady.","July 1 marks four years of legalized recreational cannabis use in Connecticut, and with legalization came major changes to the medical marijuana market.  
A law enacted in 2012 allowed the purchase and use of cannabis for medical reasons only. But in 2021, the state legalized recreational use for everyone 21 and older. Statewide recreational retail sales began in January 2023, and by May 2023, recreational sales accounted for the majority of state cannabis retail sales, a trend that has continued to today.
Connecticut was the 19th state to legalize recreational marijuana. 
Under state law, anyone 21 or older without a medical card is allowed to possess up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower or other cannabis product equivalent in public and up to 5 ounces in their private residence. Medical cardholders can posses up to 5 ounces of cannabis on their person.
Not only have recreational sales increased, but medical purchases have made up less than half of the state’s cannabis market retail sales since May 2023.
Both medical and recreational dispensaries sell similar products, but medical users who are using the product to treat “debilitating medical conditions” aren’t subject to the cannabis tax. Medical users can also buy other products that recreational users cannot, including capsules, tablets, pills, sublinguals and suppositories.
Medical users are also not subject to potency restrictions, while recreational cannabis is currently capped at 30% THC for cannabis flower and 60% THC products other than vapes. However, as of Oct. 1, 2025, the cap for raw flower will be raised to 35% THC and 70% THC for concentrates other than vapes.
The cannabis tax is dependent on both the product and the amount of THC; edible products are taxed the most heavily per milligram of THC and plant products the least. For an eighth of flower that’s 15% THC, for the tax currently sits at around 9.4%, fluctuating based on product pricing. Edibles are subject to a tax of $0.0275 per milligram of the product’s total THC content.
Medical card holders are required to apply for renewal annually, which involves a consultation fee with health care providers that can range from $100 to $350 for user 18 and older. For users under 18, users must have a condition specified by the legislature for medical usage as well as parental consent and a caregiver arrangement.
Because cannabis usage is federally illegal, medical card holders are prohibited from purchasing firearms, and everyone applying for a firearm is required to disclose their usage of cannabis and other federally controlled substances. Federal law bars all cannabis users from owning a firearm.
Each hybrid or recreational cannabis retailer registered in Connecticut must pay the cannabis tax, which varies by product. The state cannabis tax brought in $21.3 million in state revenue for FY 2024.
Overall, the sales tax — along with state sales tax, municipality sales tax and licensing and conversion fees for dispensaries — brought in $49.4 million in cannabis revenue for FY 2024.
While there are dozens of products on the market, usable cannabis flower, which is just the dried plant, brings in the most sales across the medical and recreational markets. Overall, in May 2025, recreational cannabis retail sales were $18.7 million. Medical retail sales were $6.6 million.
There is only one exclusively medical dispensary in the state. The rest of the dispensaries have transitioned and cater to both the recreational market and the medical market as hybrid dealers, or just the recreational market.
Statewide, there are 36 recreational dispensaries and 35 hybrid dealers. However, the number of dispensaries fluctuates. Back in January 2023, only nine hybrid dispensaries existed. Numbers from around February 2025 showed 64 dispensaries in the state— eight fewer than are currently open.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-10.15.39-AM-1024x737.png,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.
Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.
If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”
 Reaction from lawmakers

Republican lawmakers celebrated the opinion as another strike against abortions in the state. The federal ruling follows decisions by the state’s highest court upholding the state’s so-called “fetal heartbeat” law as a six-week abortion ban.
“Planned Parenthood has sued South Carolina over and over again, and over and over again, the abortion-giant keeps losing,” state Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a win for all South Carolina taxpayers, and most of all, this pro-life generation looking forward to the day when Planned Parenthood’s doors close for good.”
The opinion allows the state to determine how it spends its money without interference from outside groups, Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement.
“The Supreme Court just slammed the door on Planned Parenthood’s latest attempt to force its radical agenda through the courts on our state,” Wilson said. “South Carolina, not federal judges or D.C. activist groups, gets to decide how we run our Medicaid program.”
The decision will disproportionately affect low-income women who relied on Planned Parenthood’s services, Sens. Margie Bright Matthews and Tameika Isaac Devine said in a joint statement.
“The real price of this decision will be paid by patients, especially Black, brown and rural women who now face fewer options and greater barriers to care,” the Walterboro and Columbia Democrats said.

“It can be blistering out here, but as long as you bring something to keep hydrated, and keep the children hydrated, it’s OK,” said Cearnel.
The trio had been at the play area for about two hours when approached for this story. Cearnel pointed to a gallon-sized bottle of water and remarked that it had been a “block of ice” when they arrived.
“A lot of people come out here to beat the heat,” Cearnel said. “Two days ago, there were some grandparents out here with their grandchildren because their AC went out and they came to the splash pad because it’s free.”
On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for most of Central North Carolina until 7 p.m. That was a downgrade from the Extreme Heat Warning in effect on Wednesday, when temperatures were several degrees warmer.
Wake County announced that temporary cooling stations across the county would remain open through at least June 30 as a response to the heat wave.
“During prolonged periods of extreme heat, it’s important for everyone to remain cautious and continue taking the proper steps to stay cool,” said Josh Creighton, deputy director of Wake County Fire Services and Emergency Management. “If at all possible, avoid strenuous activity outside during the hottest part of the day. Take breaks in the shade, or preferably in an air-conditioned space, and drink plenty of water.”
In Winston-Salem, housing activists gathered this week to demand the City of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County enact “immediate plans” to protect the county’s “elderly, children, unhoused and others without access to air conditioning from heat deaths.”
Housing Justice Now said the county’s response to the heat advisories had been “sorely lacking.”
“The only official response to the heat advisory from Forsyth County is a Facebook post stating: “be careful with the extreme heat expected this week!” Housing Justice Now said in a press release it shared earlier this week. “With conditions demanding more than a one-liner on social media, Housing Justice Now and community advocates urge public officials to do better.”
The group demands included extending the county’s public library hours and using vacant buildings such as the old courthouse and Kaledium North (a downtown museum that targets children and families) as cooling stations.
Back in Wake County, Vielka Gabriel, the season and volunteer supervisor, who oversees “Cool for Wake,” the county’s heat relief program that provides window air conditioners and fans to people who can’t afford them, said soaring temperatures this week sent demand into overdrive.

“We have lots of individuals that are seniors who have broken HVAC systems and can’t afford to get their systems fixed,” Gabriel said. “We’re also partnering with our public health department, which has been referring individuals with chronic illnesses, newborn babies that are coming out of NICUs (Neonatal Intensive Care Units).”
On Wednesday, Gabriel said “Cool for Wake” ordered eight air conditioners for senior citizens and donated six used ones to families who needed them.
“We’ve just restocked our regional centers with fans,” she said. “Yesterday alone, I’ve ordered about 150 fans.”
The fans are sent to regional centers, so residents don’t have to travel to Raleigh to get them. “Cool for Wake” also arranges deliveries of air conditioners to residents with chronic illnesses, she said.
“We’re utilizing a partnership with the Raleigh Regional Association Realtors Giving Network,” Gabriel said. “They took six requests on Tuesday, and delivered four and are delivering the other two today [Wednesday].”
Gabriel noted that residents who receive air conditioning units must arrange to have them installed.
Residents are grateful to receive fans, Gabriel said, but acknowledged that in the extreme heat the region is experiencing, a traditional box fan does little more than circulate hot air.
“This year, I’ve made a major push into getting more air conditioning units into homes,” Gabriel said. “It has been a challenge because of the cost. We have an amazing community, however, that has stepped up to the call and has been helping to get gently used units into homes.”
The Central America native has been looking into acquiring cooling units that are popular there. The units use water and ice to cool rooms, Gabriel said.
“We’re just trying to find ways that are truly effective in keeping a person cool.
In the meantime, Gabriel said residents should close curtains, lock doors and run AC units strategically to conserve energy.
This year, Gabriel said, “Cool for Wake” has worked with the Wake County Housing team to connect with the county’s westernization program to help seniors and others with to provide adequate cooling systems.
“Part of my ask would be for businesses and folks to help us get to the root cause [of why a resident doesn’t have an adequate cooling system],” Gabriel said. “If the HVAC system is the need, is there a way get donations or have [HVAC] companies come in and check units?”
Continued monetary donations are also critical, Gabriel said. And air conditioning units are no longer a luxury as summer temperatures continue to rise.
“We can get box fans rather cheaply, but if four people or five people got together and donated $25 each, it would help us be able to purchase more air conditioning units,” Gabriel said. “We really need to see the need for air conditioning units in the community.”

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)The two unions representing nearly 40,000 Minnesota state workers — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — separately announced Friday that they reached tentative agreements with the state.
MAPE members have been fuming about Gov. Tim Walz’s part-time return-to-office order that took effect earlier this month and have picketed outside negotiations between Minnesota budget officials and their union.
Under Walz’s order, state employees must work in the office at least 50% of the time unless they live more than 50 miles away or receive an exemption. Walz argues the policy will improve collaboration, mentorship and workplace culture, with the added benefit of bringing bodies and dollars back to downtown St. Paul.
The return-to-work order itself was not negotiable, MAPE said in a press release, but the union said the agreement includes a 21-day notice requirement for telework changes, up from 14 days.
“To fight off concessions in a year like this is a real testament to our members,” MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a statement. “They showed up at the table, at the rallies and at the site. This was a contract campaign in the truest sense, and our members won it.”
MAPE and AFSCME members have also expressed outrage over the state’s health care proposals, which they estimated would have raised many workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year. The administration says rising health care costs left them no choice, but MAPE and AFSCME seems to have prevailed on this point.
The tentative agreement includes “a complete defeat” of the state’s health care proposals, AFSCME Council 5 said in a press release, and MAPE said it too had “successfully fought back the most aggressive health care cost increases.”
AFSCME Council 5 also won across-the-board raises of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.75% in 2026. MAPE said it secured over 3% in across-the-board raises over the 2025-2027 contract term.
“This tentative agreement is the direct result of the incredible strength, solidarity and determination shown by our union members from every corner of our state who were determined to fight for economic justice and the public services they provide every day,” AFSCME Council 5 Executive Director Bart Andersen said in a statement.
MAPE members will vote to ratify the agreement in August; AFSCME Council 5 did not announce when their dues-paying members will vote on the agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230073-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802
,DC,2025-06-27 14:45:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-limits-injunctions-allows-trump-act-birthright-citizenship-ban,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday in a major decision reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order barring birthright citizenship.The high court declined to decide the constitutionality of birthright citizenship itself, but said the executive order rewriting the constitutional right to birthright citizenship could go into effect within 30 days after Friday’s ruling.The ruling likely could hamper other legal challenges against Trump administration actions in which nationwide injunctions are sought.In a 6-3 ruling, the conservative justices found that nationwide “injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”“The Court grants the Government’s applications for a partial stay of the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,” according to the ruling written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.While the dispute before the court related to Trump’s executive order to rewrite the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, the Trump administration asked the high court to instead focus on the issue of preliminary injunctions granted by lower courts.“The applications do not raise—and thus the Court does not address—the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act,” according to the ruling, referring to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil.The order instructs lower courts to “move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity.""More than two dozen nationwide injunctionsIn the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, through April 29, judges issued about 25 nationwide injunctions, according to the Congressional Research Service.“The lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate; we therefore leave it to them to consider these and any related arguments,” according to the ruling.A narrower injunction could refer to a class action suit.Barrett argued that a nationwide injunction would not grant more relief for barring the enforcement of Trump’s executive order against a pregnant person who is not a U.S. citizen and fears their child would be denied citizenship.“Her child will not be denied citizenship. And extending the injunction to cover everyone similarly situated would not render her relief any more complete,” according to the ruling. “So the individual and associational respondents are wrong to characterize the universal injunction as simply an application of the complete-relief principle.”Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.In last month’s oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, he said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.Origins of birthright citizenship caseThe case, Trump v. CASA, was consolidated from three cases.One was brought by immigrant rights groups and several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens who filed their case in Maryland; the second came from four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — that filed a case in Washington state; and the third came from 18 Democratic state attorneys general who filed the challenge in Massachusetts.Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.This is not the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of birthright citizenship.In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld the 14th Amendment, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, extending birthright citizenship.In that 19th-century case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had legal authority to be in the United States, such as a temporary visa. While Ark was born in California, his citizenship was not recognized when he went on a trip to China. Upon his return to California, he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.When his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, the high court ruled that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.The Trump administration has argued that the 1898 case was misinterpreted and point to a specific phrase: “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.Attorneys for the Trump administration contend that the phrase in the 14th Amendment means that birthright citizenship only applies to children born to parents who are ""subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.That would mean, under their view, people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin and therefore so would be any children they have.",,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

Read this story in English.
Los legisladores de Connecticut aprobaron en esta sesión legislativa una ley que reforma partes de las leyes estatales de protección al consumidor, añadiendo salvaguardas adicionales para quienes compran una amplia variedad de bienes y servicios.
El proyecto de ley de 33 páginas, promulgado por el Gobernador Ned Lamont a principios de este mes, fue una de las principales prioridades de los Demócratas del Senado este año e incluye cambios de gran alcance.
Amplía la capacidad de la Fiscalía General del estado para controlar la especulación de precios, exige que las empresas revelen las llamadas tarifas basura, exige a las empresas que producen dispositivos conectados a internet que informen a los usuarios si su tecnología captura y comparte audio o video desde los hogares, y más.
El Senador James Maroney, Demócrata por Milford, ayudó a impulsar el proyecto de ley, S.B. 3, en la legislatura y afirmó que ayudaría a proteger a los residentes de Connecticut en un panorama de consumo cambiante.
“Connecticut está intensificando sus esfuerzos para proteger a las familias de prácticas comerciales abusivas, ya sea mediante micrófonos en electrodomésticos, grabaciones de conversaciones o cargos sorpresa por productos engañosos que inflan sus facturas”, declaró Maroney, copresidente del Comité de Derecho General de la Legislatura.
Esto es lo que el proyecto de ley hará y lo que no hará.
Abusos de precios
Connecticut ya contaba con una ley que permitía al fiscal general del estado supervisar y procesar los casos de abuso de precios, o el aumento artificial del precio de los productos durante emergencias, como desastres naturales.
La S.B. 3 amplía la supervisión del fiscal general más allá de los minoristas, como supermercados y gasolineras. Ahora, la oficina del fiscal general también puede investigar y acusar a distribuidores, fabricantes, proveedores y mayoristas por cobrar precios “injustificadamente excesivos”.
La ley también amplió esa supervisión a los contratos de alquiler y arrendamiento.
Renovaciones automáticas
¿Alguna vez se ha suscrito a un servicio y ha olvidado que lo estaba pagando? Bueno, la legislatura de Connecticut quiere asegurarse de que reciba un recordatorio.
Parte de la nueva ley de protección al consumidor exige que algunas compañías con “renovaciones automáticas” o “cláusulas de servicio continuo” envíen a los consumidores un aviso anual indicando que se les seguirá cobrando por el servicio.
La ley también exige que las compañías informen a los consumidores cómo pueden cancelar ese contrato recurrente a través de un sitio web, teléfono o correo electrónico.
Sin embargo, este apartado del proyecto de ley no aplica a todas las compañías. Los legisladores establecieron exenciones específicas a esta norma para las empresas de gas, agua y electricidad, así como para los proveedores de servicios de internet. También establecieron exenciones similares para los bancos y las compañías de seguros.
Todos ellos ya están regulados por entidades estatales y federales independientes.
Sin embargo, los legisladores también eximieron lo que denominaron “servicios globales o nacionales” que ofrecen predominantemente “contenido audiovisual”, lo que parece incluir los servicios de streaming en línea.
Divulgación total de precios
Otra sección de la nueva ley aborda las tarifas ocultas, o tarifas basura, como a veces se les llama.
Los legisladores elaboraron un texto que prohíbe a las empresas anunciar, exhibir u ofrecer un bien o servicio a un precio que no incorpore todas las tarifas, cargos y costos que los consumidores deberán pagar.
Si dichas tarifas no se anuncian ni exhiben, o si los cargos se ocultan, se presentan de forma intencionada o se tergiversan, las empresas pueden ser demandadas en virtud de la Ley de Prácticas Comerciales Desleales de Connecticut.
Este tipo de requisito también se aplica a las propiedades en alquiler. El proyecto de ley generalmente establece que el arrendatario debe incluir cualquier tarifa, cargo o costo periódico que el inquilino deba pagar al anunciar una vivienda en alquiler.
Al igual que con las renovaciones automáticas, existen excepciones a la divulgación de tarifas.
Las empresas no necesitan detallar los impuestos federales, estatales o locales que se añaden al precio de compra. La ley tampoco se aplica en situaciones en las que una empresa no puede calcular de forma viable el costo de un servicio, como el envío, durante la compra.
Dispositivos conectados a internet
Los legisladores de Connecticut también abordaron un problema relativamente nuevo para los consumidores: los dispositivos que pueden grabar a las personas en sus propios hogares.
La legislatura, controlada por los Demócratas, busca evitar que las empresas que venden electrodomésticos, televisores o juguetes conectados a internet graben a consumidores involuntarios y utilicen esa información para sus propios fines.
La nueva ley especifica que las empresas que venden estos productos deben informar a los consumidores cuándo su dispositivo puede transmitir audio o video al fabricante o a un tercero. Los dispositivos también deben ofrecer a los consumidores la opción de desactivar dichas funciones, a menos que dicha acción inutilice el dispositivo.
Los legisladores también añadieron una sección al proyecto de ley que prohíbe que los dispositivos conectados a internet incluyan funciones integradas que permitan a las fuerzas del orden monitorear las comunicaciones de las personas.
Y prohíbe a las empresas utilizar los dispositivos para recopilar información que pueda ayudar a otras empresas a identificar al usuario para publicidad dirigida.
Maroney se refirió a estas secciones como las “disposiciones contra escuchas ilegales” del proyecto de ley.
Derecho a reparar
Una de las secciones más ambiciosas de la ley aborda el derecho a reparar, que busca garantizar que los consumidores tengan acceso a todos los materiales necesarios para reparar sus propios productos.
Más de media docena de estados ya han aprobado disposiciones similares.
La versión de Connecticut exige que los fabricantes de productos electrónicos o electrodomésticos pongan a disposición de los consumidores recursos para “diagnosticar, mantener o reparar sus productos”.
El proyecto de ley especifica que estos recursos deben incluir “documentación, piezas y herramientas”, y se aplicará a los productos “fabricados, vendidos o usados” en Connecticut después del 1 de julio de 2026.
Los fabricantes estarán obligados a poner a disposición dicha documentación, piezas y herramientas durante tres o cinco años, dependiendo del precio del producto.
Sin embargo, las empresas no están obligadas a entregar nada que se considere secreto comercial o propiedad intelectual, y el proyecto de ley no se aplica a los productos que ya no se fabrican.
Aun así, hay una larga lista de artículos que no estarán cubiertos, incluidos barcos, vehículos todo terreno, generadores, herramientas eléctricas, estaciones de carga de vehículos eléctricos, equipos de jardinería, equipos de construcción, equipos agrícolas, equipos forestales, equipos de minería y motores.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association (States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector).

The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.”
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”


Moran’s communications director, Angela Lingg, said “the Senate is continuing to negotiate any changes to Medicaid, and Sen. Moran is working to make certain Kansas hospitals are at the forefront of those discussions.”


Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.”
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.”
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association president and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients.
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation.
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent.
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.”
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”

A flurry of lawsuits is challenging the Trump administration's “slash-and-burn"" campaign, which axed hundreds of grant programs mid-stream. The White House is fundamentally misinterpreting a short phrase buried in recent regulation, the suits argue, to justify the sweeping cuts.
The post Flurry of lawsuits over Trump cuts hinge on nine words appeared first[...]","THERE WAS NOTHING subtle about the Trump administration’s approach to government spending when Elon Musk waved a chainsaw in front of a crowd of cheering activists at a February gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. The clear message from the face of the new Department of Government Efficiency: This is no delicate pruning exercise but one in which we’re felling entire trees.
The sweeping powers of the presidency give the administration plenty of running room to upend the status quo, but it can’t do that by simply reinterpreting federal laws and regulations. That’s the argument at the heart of a series of lawsuits challenging sweeping cuts to federal grants.
Hundreds of organizations across the country were notified in recent weeks that federal grants they operated – funding everything from anti-violence programs to initiatives to ensure clean drinking water – were being terminated immediately. 
The government authority to abruptly cancel millions of dollars in funding relied on the same boilerplate wording delivered to each grant recipient, usually in a short email: The award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  
A coalition of state attorneys general that includes Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell filed suit on June 24 against an array of federal offices over the administration’s use of that nine-word phrase. The “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign” rests on a fundamental misinterpretation of a short subclause “buried in federal regulations” put out by the Office of Management of Budget, the attorneys general argue. 
While this clause says that agencies can indeed terminate grants if they no longer “effectuate program goals or agency priorities,” the AGs argue that the Trump administration is fundamentally misinterpreting the meaning of this language. 
The clause does not mean that when an administration changes its priorities that organizations abiding by the terms of their grants are suddenly subjected to having the grants yanked, the complaint argues. Instead, according to the lawsuit, the wording means the grant is subject to termination if it’s determined that the recipient is not meeting the goals set out for the grant program at its inception. 
The regulatory language governing grants was put in place by OMB in 2020, but the suit claims the federal office “never once indicated that the words ‘agency priorities’ would confer broad authority on federal agencies to terminate grants based on new or changed agency priorities.”  
Rather, the suit says, the office focused on establishing program goals at the time that the grant award was made public. In other words, to ensure the continuity of their funding, grant recipients have to do what the grant said they would do. 
Yet, in recent months, programs that have been using money in the way Congress intended in authorizing the spending suddenly saw the rug pulled out from under them.  
“The results have been devastating,” the coalition of mostly blue state attorneys general wrote in their complaint filed this week. “With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived states of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more. Federal agencies have done all of this without any advance notice, without any explanation to the state recipients, and in direct contravention of the will of Congress.” 
Massachusetts housing groups, the state Department of Agricultural Resources, forestry services, public health programs, and violence prevention organizations are just some of the groups left reeling from abrupt cuts. 
In a separate suit filed in March, before the recent complaint from state AGs, organizations that fight against discrimination in housing organizations sued to “quite literally keep the lights on.” A US District Court judge in Massachusetts granted a temporary restraining order reinstating 78 Fair Housing Initiatives Program grants. 
These cuts came “arbitrarily and without notice, reason, or sensible explanation,” the housing organizations argued, and suddenly losing the funding would cause immediate and irreparable harm. 
The axe also fell on violence prevention organizations like Chelsea-based Roca, which saw a $6 million grant terminated for not being aligned with the agency priorities. Health Resources in Action, a Boston-based non-profit public health equity organization and one of the five named plaintiffs in a national class action suit, is among a group of community organizations suing the Trump administration for slashing Department of Justice grants because of changed priorities. 
In the suit, which received a hearing in federal court in Washington, DC, on Thursday, the community organization coalition argues that the use of the boilerplate language when the Office of Justice Programs ended more than 370 multi-year agreements and grants was unconstitutionally vague, exceeded the office’s authority, and did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
The group argues that the idea that the agency has broad discretion to terminate a grant already awarded because of a post-hoc change in agency position is a novel and unacceptable understanding of the grant termination provision.  
It also argues that the cuts are a constitutional violation, bypassing Congress’s appropriations authority and ignoring separation of powers. 
The DOJ is asking to dismiss the suit. The groups, it said, accuse the administration of “blindly terminating various grant agreements ‘en masse’ so that it can avoid spending congressionally appropriated funds,” adding, “These accusations are unfounded and wrong.” 
In the Trump administration’s view, the DOJ reviewed several thousand “competitive, discretionary grants” to assess whether those grants aligned with current agency priorities, deciding to terminate 376 grant agreements. It intends to reallocate those funds to “new projects that more directly advance agency priorities.” 
Along with asking that funds be reinstated, the community groups want an injunction and declaration that the DOJ’s interpretation of the right to terminate a grant based on its alignment with agency priorities is incorrect. 
In the suit filed this week, the attorneys general do not ask to stop any particular grant cut, but rather seek a legal declaration on the meaning of the OMB “priorities” clause. According to the court docket, the government has not yet submitted a response.
The Department of Justice is one of the named defendants and is representing the heads of OMB, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and he National Science Foundation. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment in an email on Thursday. 
The states and programs in question receive billions of dollars in federal funding each year, the lawsuit asserts. Beyond the funds that the administration has already attempted to cut off, there are ongoing grant programs to which the organizations are planning to apply. 
These attorneys general and the impacted organizations are worried not just about the impacts of the funds already stopped mid-stream, but also the fate of future grant awards.
Indeed, a national fair housing group filed suit on the same day, arguing that “HUD is flouting its obligation to administer a fair housing grant program established and funded by Congress.” The agency is refusing to spend appropriated funds, the lawsuit argues, cutting off its usual grant awards schedule midstream. 
HUD has not awarded any new grants or asked Congress to revoke already approved funds for these new grants, and because any funds that are not assigned by September will expire, the agency’s inaction “risks the complete loss of the appropriated funds.” 
Each of the groups and states bringing the array of lawsuits argue that the damage goes beyond even the significant funding loss, and that they are already feeling the urgency.
Attorney Lisa Newman, representing the violence prevention coalition, told US District Court Judge Amit Mehta on Thursday that the erosion of trust and damage to reputation to these on-the-ground violence prevention groups, built up over decades, “cannot be overstated.” The groups have made promises to community members who will assume that the organizations are backing away from their obligations, she said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As many as 40 employees of the Indiana Department of Child Services could lose their jobs under a reorganization eliminating three layers of management, which agency leaders said would improve communication and decision-making.
The agency protecting Hoosier children from abuse and neglect announced the changes Friday. They go into effect July 1.
  Department of Child Services Director Adam Krupp
DCS Director Adam Krupp said the layoffs won’t put children at risk because “these are not the folks on the front line.”
Instead, the employees are part of middle and upper management that Krupp is reducing so that family case managers have a more direct line to authority. Between 16 and 40 employees could be laid off, depending on if some accept new lower-paying positions.
“This is going to reduce the opportunity for communication breakdowns and it’s going to reduce the delay in decision-making,” he said. “I very much believe this will improve our outcomes in terms of focusing on child safety and working closely with families, whether it be on the prevention side or the intervention side.”
The behemoth agency has more than 4,040 employees, with almost 1,800 family case managers who handle daily interactions with children and families.
“All Hoosier children deserve a safe place to lay their head at night, and our most vulnerable kids often need an extra layer of security. Things are not working as well as they should at DCS, but we are going to change that,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “With this entrepreneurial plan, we will remove layers of inefficient middle management and bureaucracy and instead redirect resources to frontline services like foster care and family case workers to keep kids safe.”
It is estimated the state could save between $4 million and $8 million from restructuring – dubbed Project Awaken — but that money could also be redirected to child safety efforts.
DCS Regions before and after
 
Krupp talked with the ICC and went through the nine layers of employees currently in the agency, from him all the way down to family case managers. The reorganization will eliminate a level of assistant deputy directors and several others.
The state will also move from 18 different regions — each with its own manager — to five. The agency said it looked at caseloads, square mileage and staff to help determine the regions, generally aligning with a central region and four quadrants.
He noted that these regions had slowly developed their own microcultures, or 18 different ways of doing things. The streamlining will result in more consistent policies.
“Executive management, right now, we are too far removed from a family case manager, and that’s not because of geographical distance. That’s simply because of all the layers of communication, information flow and decision-making,” Krupp said.

He added the state will continue to hire family case managers, noting it’s a constant cycle of turnover and training.
“It never really stops,” Krupp said.
He said currently the agency needs between 175 and 195 more family case managers to meet statutory caseload ratios. DCS has long struggled with retention due to the stress of the job and the three months needed for training.
There was a brief move during the General Assembly session to eliminate those caseload rules, but Krupp said that is not a priority. He said lawmakers considered giving the agency more flexibility.
As part of the restructuring, the legal division will also be aligned under the new regions and work more as a co-leader with regional directors. Financial and budgeting efforts have been centralized so that there is more visibility into day-to-day spending. DCS has regularly overspent its appropriation in the state budget.
Krupp added that work toward reorganization started during the transition period after the November election. The agency in May announced new mission, vision and purpose statements and this is the second phase of reorganization.

Rodgers Health Center will provide doula services to maternity patients (Suzanne King/The Beacon).When Tristin Dockery was in labor with her first son in 2021, she only had one request: To get up and walk around her hospital room.
The nurse on duty said no.
So Dockery, then 20, stayed in her uncomfortable hospital bed as one contraction followed another. It was at the height of COVID. She and her husband were alone. And Dockery didn’t think she had much choice but to do as she was told.
“We were young and we’d never had a baby,” she said. “We didn’t know what we were doing.”
Dockery, an esthetician who works and lives 50 miles east of Kansas City in Lexington, was determined that things would be different last year when she learned she was pregnant again. She turned to the Maternal and Infant Health Center (MaIH) in Lexington.
The organization provided a doula who helped Dockery through her pregnancy and the first months after she gave birth.
“I had someone who was going to be there,” Dockery said, “who was going to help me focus on what I needed and what I wanted.”
On June 26, Altruism Inc., the nonprofit that runs the MaIH Center in Lexington, will open a second center. This one is in Kansas City’s urban Westside neighborhood.
The new Kansas City center, opening in partnership with Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center, will share space with the health center’s maternity care clinic at 2121 Summit St. and be called the MaIH Center at Sam Rodgers.
Putting doula care and other nonclinical support services in the same space with maternal health is an effort to remove a potential barrier that could keep expectant parents from getting all the services they need, said Janelle Harvey Jordan, chief operating officer at the Samuel Rodgers center.
“We’re trying to help mothers by having everything in one area,” Jordan said. Offering doula services provides “an avenue for new moms to have better outcomes.”
 What is a doula?

Doulas don’t provide medical care, but they establish relationships with patients and answer questions, give advice and offer support. They also advocate for patients, helping them communicate with their medical provider.
Studies show that the extra attention and education significantly boosts maternal outcomes, lowering the risk of cesarean deliveries by 47% and cutting the chance of preterm deliveries by 29%. Doulas also improve by 46% the rate at which new parents show up for postpartum medical checkups.
Once considered a perk only for those who could afford it, doulas are increasingly seen as an important tool in the effort to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce pregnancy-related deaths in poor and underserved communities.
In fact, last year Medicaid programs in both Missouri and Kansas began covering doula services. In its emergency rule granting the coverage last fall, Missouri’s Department of Social Services cited “an immediate danger to public health, safety or welfare of pregnant women in Missouri” as the reason doula services should be covered.
It is one of the changes Missouri’s Medicaid program has made in recent years to try to improve the state’s concerning maternal mortality rate.
According to data collected by KFF, a health policy research organization, Missouri’s maternal mortality rate between 2018 and 2022 was 24 deaths per 100,000 live births, and Kansas’ was 23 deaths per 100,000 live births. For the United States overall, the rate was 23.
But in Missouri the pregnancy-related mortality rate was three times worse for Black people than for white people. And in Kansas, more than half of pregnancy-related deaths were people who identified as racial and ethnic minorities.
In both states, pregnancy mortality reviews found that most deaths related to pregnancy were preventable.
According to the March of Dimes, more than 20% of Missouri infants were born to people who did not get adequate prenatal care. And in Kansas, the organization found that almost 17% of infants were born to people who didn’t get adequate prenatal care.
 Balancing the scales

Tonia Wright, Altruism’s CEO, is confident that making doula care available to more expectant parents will mean that more people get the care they need, and that will help balance the scales.
“In Missouri, a woman who is covered by Medicaid is seven times more likely to have a pregnancy-associated death,” Wright said. “By allowing doulas to bill for their services, it’s leveling the playing field between Medicaid-covered pregnant people and privately insured pregnant people.”
Wright, whose marketing firm, Grace Advertising & Consulting Inc., has long advised health care organizations, decided after the pandemic to form a nonprofit to help smaller health-related organizations. At first she thought she would help them with marketing and advocacy. But then she saw an even greater need and decided to tackle health disparities directly.
“The statistics in Missouri about maternal and infant health were just landing hard,” she said. “COVID had ripped the veil and really laid bare what was happening, especially for poor white women, Black women and Hispanic women. I could not escape the research studies, the news stories. So I pivoted.”
That’s when she founded the MaIH Center in Lexington.
It offers doulas for free to clients without insurance. The Kansas City center will do the same.
People who have doula care tend to have better outcomes, Wright said, because their needs are more likely met. Someone with access to government food assistance and regular health checkups — services a doula might help set up for a client — is less likely to have gestational diabetes, pregnancy-related high blood pressure and even postpartum depression. Those are all leading causes of maternal deaths.
Dockery said her doula, Shariah Edwards, helped her deal with severe morning sickness, which lasted her entire second pregnancy. She helped Dockery write a birth plan, so when she went into labor her wishes about medication and other things would already be in her medical chart.
And Edwards was with Dockery at the hospital for her labor and delivery, making sure her plan was followed. After Dockery’s second son was born, Edwards stayed by her side, Dockery said, helping her deal with postpartum depression.
“She came to my house,” she said. “She watched the baby so I could take a nap. She offered to help me clean up. And she really just sat with me a lot and talked through it all.”
 Doulas aren’t new to Sam Rodgers

Doulas are not new to the maternity care the Samuel Rodgers center provides. The community health clinic, a federally qualified health clinic, participated in a program funded by UnitedHealthcare to encourage new approaches to prenatal and postpartum care.
The center experimented with multicultural outreach campaigns, emphasized screenings to identify patients facing social barriers to care and offered patients help signing up for Medicaid, government food aid and other community programs.
The result, according to a UnitedHealthcare blog post, was a 30% increase in behavioral health and dental care for obstetric patients, a 3.6% improvement in full-term births and a 90% improvement in people showing up for postnatal care appointments.
And in 2023, the Samuel Rodgers center received a $2 million grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration to continue this work, which included offering doula care.
The health center’s new partnership with Altruism is helping extend that work again. It’s not hard to find benefits to giving patients the extra support a doula provides, said Bob Theis, Sam Rodgers’ chief executive officer.
Helping a pregnant person maintain a healthy pregnancy not only makes that birthing person healthier, it makes their new baby healthier.
“Having a good prenatal care program results in healthy birth weight babies and healthy birth weight babies bring stronger children into the world,” Theis said.
And caring for a baby at a healthy weight can cost a fraction of what it takes to care for a baby who comes into the world early or underweight. Theis said a low birth-weight baby’s care might cost 10 times more than a baby born at a healthy weight.
At least by the measure of birth weight, Sam Rodgers’ efforts to promote and improve prenatal care are paying off. Theis said the center’s percentage of low birth-weight babies fell to 5.5% in 2024 from 8% four years earlier.
Extending doula care by partnering with Altruism, he said, will add to that success.
“We’re building healthy kids in our community,” Theis said, “because one day I’m going to retire, and I want to make sure that we’re building a strong community of strong children to take care of me when I’m ready.”

Laura Kelly, left, and Kansas Department of Labor secretary Amber Shultz, right, announce the launch of the state's new online unemployment system Nov. 22, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas program aimed at preventing unemployment fraud has been caught in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The U.S. Department of Labor in May canceled $400 million in unemployment insurance grants across the country. Included within the grant funding was language that the Trump administration associated with DEI initiatives, such as studying the “equity of the unemployment system” and an “equitable access director.”
A spokesperson for the department said the cuts were “part of the administration’s ongoing effort to remove unlawful DEI programs across government.”
But at the Kansas Department of Labor, the rescission didn’t eliminate any DEI programs.
Instead, it defunded a program that implemented identity verification tools, fraud analytics and safeguards to prevent criminal attacks and system failures, which were crucial in the wake of record volumes of fraudulent claims during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amber Shultz, Kansas labor secretary, wrote a letter Thursday to U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, expressing her “deep concern and disappointment” over the federal government’s decision, which she called “both confusing and contradictory.”
“The rationale of canceling a grant specifically intended to detect and prevent fraud is, frankly, counterproductive,” Shultz said in the letter.
Kansas forfeited $1 million of the $1.7 million total without forewarning.
“Revoking this support now leaves states more vulnerable to the very threats we were all called to confront,” Shultz said.
She called the funding loss “a huge blow,” and said she anticipates that employers and claimants will feel the impacts, which could mean slower claims processes.
The termination notice the state received from the federal government reasoned that the grant “no longer effectuates the department’s priorities for its grant funding.”
Communication between the state and federal departments has been nonexistent. Shultz said in a phone call that she and department staff have been attempting to communicate with the federal department, without any response.
A statement to Kansas Reflector attributed to a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said America’s unemployment system is in an “infrastructure crisis, riddled with waste, fraud and abuse.”
The statement said the Biden administration squandered its opportunity to fix the system by focusing “on equitable access rather than advancing access for all Americans in need.”
Shultz said none of the funding for Kansas’ unemployment insurance fraud prevention grant program was used for DEI initiatives.
The federal department is fulfilling its goal, Shultz said, “if they want fraudsters to have equitable access to our funds.”
A different grant from the U.S. Department of Labor under the Biden administration, called the equity grant, gave Kansas more than $4.5 million, which the state used to ensure all Kansans could access the unemployment system. That meant focusing on rural Kansans without broadband access, Shultz said.
With the federal funding, the state fraud prevention program was able to conduct investigations and recover funds lost to fraudulent claims. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kansas and many other states faced extreme volumes of unemployment fraud, largely from international crime rings, which took advantage of aged and vulnerable claims systems. Kansas recently recovered $11 million in fraudulent claims, which totaled around 2.4% of the $460 million in state and federal funds lost during the pandemic.
The federal department’s Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office have pressed states across the country to improve fraud prevention and recovery efforts.
“Yet now we are asked to do so with fewer tools, fewer resources, and diminished federal partnership,” Shultz said in the letter to Chavez-DeRemer. “That not only undermines the substantial progress already made, but it also weakens our readiness for future crises.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/241122_unempP-01-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-27 10:01:53.693125

Mike Dunleavy has canceled a bipartisan proposal that would have allowed rural school districts to maintain teacher housing with money from the state’s rural schools fund.
House Bill 174, from Rep. Robyn Niayuq Burke, D-Utqiagvik, passed the House and Senate by a combined 54-5-1 margin.
The vote count led lawmakers to raise the possibility of overriding the veto.
Burke, reached by phone on Thursday, said that when she heard about the veto, she immediately sent a text to the group chat shared by members of the House’s coalition majority.
“The response was, yes, let’s override,” she said.
It would take 40 votes from the 60 members of the combined House and Senate to override the governor’s decision on HB 174, and a vote isn’t expected until the Legislature convenes in January.
If enacted, HB 174 would allow small school districts to use the state’s Regional Educational Attendance Area fund for major maintenance at district-owned housing.
It would also allow Mount Edgecumbe High School, the state-operated boarding school in Sitka, to use the fund for major maintenance. Currently, the high school is maintained using funds from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
HB 174 also would remove a $70 million cap on the size of the REAA fund, allowing the Legislature to stock that account with more money.
In his veto message to the Legislature, the governor said that enacting HB 174 would diminish the equity across school districts “and commits the state to a local housing obligation, diverting already scarce dollars away from critical classroom repairs and complicating grant rankings.”
The message also said that the repeal of the cash cap on the REAA fund could allow general-purpose dollars to accumulate “without project deadlines and adding ongoing operating costs to the state.”
That latter comment is a reference to the bill’s fiscal note, which said that the state would have to hire two new employees to deal with the change and that there would be other costs associated with implementing HB 174.
Burke said the veto wasn’t a surprise and that the governor’s legislative office had tried to reach her about the bill, but that meeting didn’t take place before the legislative session ended.
Burke is a graduate of Mount Edgecumbe, as is her mother, grandmother and grandfather. Other lawmakers, including Sen. Donny Olson, D-Golovin, have tried to advance HB 174-like legislation in prior legislative sessions, without success.
In 2024, a similar bill passed the Senate but died in the House Finance Committee. 
“There’s a lot of excitement about it,” Burke said.
“I’m sure they’re pretty disappointed,” she said of the bill’s advocates, “because they’ve been working on that for quite a while. I’m frustrated, disappointed, not surprised, and will look forward to overriding it.”
Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, is a longtime advocate for Mount Edgecumbe. The Beacon’s call about the veto was the first he had heard of it, “but it doesn’t surprise me,” he said.
Stedman said that while it’s possible that the Legislature could override the governor’s decision, doing so is tough, “because the governor runs blocking maneuvers — no matter who the governor is, that’s just business, right? So it’s easy for him to pick off a few votes.”
It’s also a rural issue, which adds to the difficulty of gaining support, Stedman said.
The veto is “unfortunate for Edgecumbe,” Stedman said, “but there’ll be another governor in a year and a half, and we’ll give it to the next governor.”
So far this year, Dunleavy has vetoed five policy bills in addition to his line-item budget vetoes. Since taking office in December 2018, Dunleavy has vetoed 14 policy bills, a low number by historical standards.
But since 2014, the number of bills passed by the Legislature has dwindled, legislative statistics show. As a proportion of the number of bills passed by lawmakers, Dunleavy is vetoing at an above-average rate when compared to prior governors.

June 20, 2025. | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFor more than a century the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan has been home to a wide collection of materials documenting social unrest, protest, and various movements that were at a time considered radical. 
Referred to in the 1930s as “probably the most complete record of the social unrest of our times that has ever been assembled,” the collection holds books, periodicals, pamphlets, recordings of speeches and protest songs and other artifacts from movements including anarchism, feminism, labor, civil rights and anti-colonialism. 
Housed in the university’s Special Collections Research Center, the Labadie Collection is also home to one of the largest and most heavily-used stores of transgender history in the country.
While the university already boasted a strong collection of materials on trans history in 2000, that collection would be bolstered considerably through a donation from the National Transgender Library and Archives, which began as the collection of Dallas Denny.
A search for identity and information
“I knew I was transsexual by the time I was 12 or 13 and I remember the summer before I started the ninth grade. My father had retired from the Army, and we moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and I pedaled my bicycle to the library there and looked up every word I knew, which was very little,” Denny said.

She found two books. 
“One of them was in reserve, which meant I’d have to ask the librarian for it because I was just 13, and I was unwilling to do that because I felt like she would probably get in touch with my parents and my life would be over,” Denny said. 
The other was in circulation, but Denny was unable to find it on the shelves. Last she checked, after graduating from high school, it still was not available. 
“I was looking for information all through college and just not finding anything, you know, [an] occasional article in a magazine or something, but nowhere to go for help, nowhere to go for information, nowhere to go for support,” Denny said. 
After completing graduate school in 1979, Denny discovered there was a gender clinic at Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville, where she lived at the time. 
“I went there, and they turned me down, they turned down most people, but on the grounds that, essentially, I was not dysfunctional enough to be transsexual because I had two college degrees, because I worked as a child protective services worker for the state of Tennessee, because I was sexually attracted to women, because I had been married,” Denny said.  
Upon visiting the medical library, their material backed up the hospital’s findings, because those materials were generated by the clinics, Denny said. 
Denny later found a group for heterosexual crossdressers. While they did not allow trans members, Denny joined, holding her breath in hopes that they would be in touch with someone with information about her identity. 
After about five months, a member came in with a magazine called Transgender Tapestry, which held a support group in Atlanta. 
“They gave me information I’ve been looking for my whole life,” Denny said. 

Shhh, NTL&A, V. 2 No. 0, in AEGIS News No. 3 
After she was recruited to help run the support group in 1988, which she did for a year, Denny went on to found the American Educational Gender Information Service, or AEGIS in 1990, publishing pamphlets, medical bulletins and a magazine, while providing services including a 24-hour trans help line.
“My reasoning was, you know, if I am well educated and I am smart and I am literate and I couldn’t find information, how many other people are out there in a similar situation?” Denny said. 
The ‘90s was largely a print culture, Denny said, and she was exchanging newsletters with more than 100 other organizations around the world. Publishers would send her books, and whenever she’d attend a trans conference, Denny said she’d buy everything that was for sale. 
While she’d started with zero information about her identity, Denny’s collection would go on to fill two big rooms in the house she was renting. 
“I started realizing that, you know, the history of people like me was pretty much scattered through history and mostly lost, and there seemed to be little interest in rediscovering that history,” Denny said, noting that she founded another group, the Transgender Historical Society. 
Denny donated her collection of materials to AEGIS in 1993, marking the start of the National Transgender Library and Archives, however, the advent of the internet would mark the decline of brick and mortar nonprofits like Denny’s. 
While people would previously write in requesting information, receiving a response a week or two later, the internet had rendered that model obsolete, Denny said. Now individuals could share information with a wide audience for almost no cost. 
AEGIS transitioned away from a paper and stamp organization into one based on the internet, rebranding as Gender Education and Advocacy in 1998. However, that left the question of what to do with the organization’s considerable print collection.

Finding a new home for the archive
Ultimately, the organization put out a request for proposals to house the materials on January 13, 2000 and received a number proposals, which Denny said came down to two finalists: The University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan. 
As part of the criteria for applicants, Denny said the materials had to be stored in a physically and intellectually safe location, which had secured funding for the foreseeable future.
While the University of Minnesota had a long history of working with trans people, Denny said the University of Michigan was selected due to the Labadie Collection’s focus on social movements that were often unpopular. 
“I felt like it would be intellectually secure there, and it wouldn’t be reinterpreted as a gay and lesbian history instead of a trans history,” Denny said. 
It also helped that the University of Michigan had a building to house the materials, while Minnesota did not.

Labadie Collection)






 
Prior to acquiring the National Transgender Library and Archives, the Joseph A. Labadie collection already held a multitude of materials on transgender movements due to its strong LGBT collection, Curator Julie Herrada told the Michigan Advance.
When the call for proposals went out, Gender Education and Advocacy board member Sandra Cole, a professor who founded the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Gender Services Program, recommended the university apply. 
On taking a deeper look at the materials, Herrada realized the collection spanned a number of topics from medical materials on surgery and psychology to items on public health, law and cultural materials tied to LGBTQ movements. While the collection was too large to take into the Labadie Collection, Herrada said she’d gathered other units and staff within the library system and asked about working together to collect the materials and house them within their relevant departments. 
“Surprisingly, everybody was really on board with it and said that they would also make it a priority for access so it wouldn’t sit uncatalogued for however many years,” Herrada said. 
Upon collecting letters from the community to submit alongside her proposal to Gender Education Advocacy, Herrada found an outpouring of support. 
“That was real eye opening for me that there was this whole community of people out there that were advocating not only for the trans community, but for us to have this, create the space for this collection, and to maybe make it grow,” Herrada said. 
After making her case to the head of the library on the logistical matters needed to process, catalog in addition to transporting the materials from Atlanta, Georgia to Michigan, Herrada said the obvious support from the community made their case much stronger. 
Herrada oversaw the packing and shipping of the materials from their home in Atlanta to their new location in Ann Arbor, in September 2000, and on March 25, 2004 the university held a dedication of the National Transgender Library and Archives with Denny as the guest of honor.

While the original collection has long since been fully cataloged, Herrada says Denny still regularly sends them materials to add to their holdings. 
With the acquisition of the National Transgender Library and Archives in 2000 and the university’s previous holdings, Herrada said the collection has seen individuals traveling from across the world to utilize its holdings. While other universities have collected materials on transgender people, U of M was one of the first, she said. 
Having these materials available to individuals from across the globe fulfills both Denny’s personal mission of providing people with information to make sane decisions about their lives, while preserving a rich history Denny said she would hate to see lost.
Additionally, the University of Michigan was the first institution to partner with the Digital Transgender Archive, Herrada said, with Denny sending materials to the archive first for scanning, before the materials are passed on to the Labadie Collection. 
While most libraries require individuals to put in a request to view archived materials, Denny, who serves on the archive’s board, said the Digital Transgender Archive serves as a way for people to have easy access to information on trans life and history. 
Holding the line amid national backlash
Over the years, many of the movements documented within the Labadie collection have become more mainstream, Herrada noted, pointing to the growing acceptance of lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals since they began collecting materials on those communities. 
“I don’t know if I could say that we’re sort of at the forefront for making these movements more mainstream and more accepted and more accessible, but that’s part of the plan, I think,” Herrada said. “We need to have access to this material, because a lot of it is inaccessible otherwise.”
As the federal government takes aim at several marginalized groups throughout the nation under the guise of opposing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Herrada said it’s more important than ever to dig in their heels and to not only maintain, but strengthen the commitment to having these materials available. 
While the Labadie Collection has not faced any threats to its holdings on transgender individuals, Herrada said there have been some discussions around being more aware and tightening security on materials given the national climate. 
Denny shared her own concerns about holdings at other institutions, noting that the previously-independent Kinsey Institute, which holds a vast collection of materials on human sexuality, had merged with Indiana University. With Indiana state law barring the university from using state funds for the institute and the university board facing a conservative takeover, Denny expects further attacks on the institute’s funding, raising concern that institute’s materials may be less accessible in the future. 
  Rep. Lorissa Sweet, R-Wabash introduced the amendment to strip public funding for the Kinsey Institute during a hearing on the state budget in February 2023. (Screenshot of annual report.)
While she’s a bit concerned about the University of Michigan, due to the University’s decision to eliminate its diversity equity and inclusion office and halt work on its DEI 2.0 strategic plan, Denny held greater concern for the Kinsey Institute.
In addition to threats at the university level, local libraries have become a battleground as conservative groups seek to ban or sequester materials with LGBTQ+ themes. 
Alongside the University of Michigan, Denny has supplied materials to the University of Victoria in British Columbia’s transgender archives and other collections documenting trans history.
Denny noted she didn’t want all transgender materials centralized in one location due to the possibility of war or natural disaster and that she was glad there were a number of places to access these materials alongside those that had been digitized and were available online.
“Transgender people are, and probably were, and probably still are, famous for purging. They’re like, ‘I can’t be like this.’ And they’ll get rid of everything and often they just throw it in the trash or burn it,” Denny said, noting that a lot of times materials people were looking to get rid of would appear at conferences.
Now, unlike when she was 13, there is a wealth of material for trans individuals, Denny said. 
“All it was really about in all of my work was for people to have information, to make competent decisions about their lives, because if you know nothing you can’t do that” she said.

A year after the U.S. Supreme Court granted cities more authority to clear homeless encampments, how much has California’s homelessness crisis changed? 
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains — along with Lisa Halverstadt from Voice of San Diego and Aaron Schrank from LAist — the landmark Grants Pass v. Johnson ruling allowing local authorities to arrest unhoused people for sleeping in public spaces has empowered cities across California to ramp up efforts to sweep encampments, or pass more punitive anti-camping rules.
In Los Angeles for example, the police department made 68% more camping arrests in the second half of 2024 (after the court ruling), compared to the first. But last March, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency found that while 94% of people targeted under the camping ordinance wanted shelter, only 17% were able to secure it.
That includes Deadra Walicki, a 51-year-old unhoused person living near Van Nuys Boulevard in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley. In a span of 16 months — from August 2023 through December 2024 — the LAPD cited Walicki 34 times for illegal camping.
Walicki, for the most part, ignores the citations because she has neither the money to pay the fines nor a phone to contact her case manager. She lives in an encampment with her male partner, and says she wants both of them to be admitted into separate gender-segregated shelters at the same time. This, however, hasn’t happened yet.

Walicki: “The cops come here Monday through Friday and give tickets for being in the zone of the shelter. It’s whatever they want to do.”

L.A. isn’t the only city where citations for camping and other homelessness-related offenses soared shortly after Grants Pass. After filing more than 100 public records requests, Marisa found that in San Francisco, arrests and citations increased 500%, and in San Diego and Sacramento, arrests and citations doubled and tripled, respectively.

Cutting research funds, cutting forests

Let’s dive into some federal news affecting California:

Restoring research funding: On Monday federal judges issued rulings to restore hundreds of science research grants, including about 430 in California, which President Donald Trump’s administration initially canceled earlier this year as part of an effort to cut funding for programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. The frozen funds affected research related to, among other things: dementia, vaccines and health disparities among women and the LGBTQ+ community. The administration has filed appeals for some of the rulings, and it remains unclear when the money will be restored. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Removing forest protections: The Trump administration said it plans to rescind a rule developed under the Clinton administration that could result in the lifting of bans on logging and road construction within parts of national forests, including more than 4 million acres throughout California. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture said this would prevent fires, but some experts argue that timber harvesting may actually promote more flammable fuels in forests.

Banning ultra-processed food from school meals?

The state Senate is considering a bill that would get rid of food containing chemical additives — such as stabilizers, coloring and flavoring agents — in school meals by 2035.
As CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang explains, the proposal by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel has strong bipartisan support, and aligns with both Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to limit the harms of ultra-processed foods, and the federal administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign.

Gabriel, an Encino Democrat: “Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”

But a coalition of food and beverage manufacturers and other business groups oppose the measure, arguing that it makes consumers inaccurately perceive all ultra-processed food as unsafe. Pizza, for example, has ingredients such as dough conditioners and stabilizers to keep them shelf stable.

Dennis Albiani, a coalition spokesperson and president of Capitol Advocates lobbying firm: “Healthy products are going to be pulled in and labeled as ultra-processed, which in the lexicon of America means dangerous and unhealthy.”

It could happen again,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/trumps-first-immigration-crackdown-shrank-californias-population-it-could-happen-again/,California could lose votes in the electoral college and suffer economic setbacks if President Trump's immigration crackdown deters people from moving to the state.,"In summary
California could lose votes in the electoral college and suffer economic setbacks if President Trump’s immigration crackdown deters people from moving to the state.


It hasn’t happened yet, but California is bracing for a demographic and economic hit under President Donald Trump’s multi-pronged effort to limit the entry of people born abroad and deport those already in the U.S.
In fact, during the last Trump administration, California’s population declined in part because immigration to the state slowed down after the White House put up increased obstacles to enter the U.S., according to the state’s chief demographer, though COVID-19 didn’t help. The Newsom administration is worried about history repeating itself enough to cite Trump’s immigration policies as an economic risk in the state budget forecasts.
Key business sectors, including hospitality and construction, rely on the labor of workers in the U.S. without legal authorization, who themselves are a small portion of California’s immigrant population. The state’s leading tech companies, major drivers of state wealth, overwhelmingly employ highly educated people born abroad.And all these people help California maintain its population and its status as the state with the most electoral college votes during presidential elections.A full third of the state’s prime working-age population is made up of immigrants, including immigrants in the country without authorization. That latter group represents roughly a tenth of the state’s workers, said Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at UC Davis who studies the economic impact of immigrants. And despite popular rhetoric, California workers living here without legal authorization fill jobs that few legal residents want.
Most of the undocumented workers in California have been here for a long time — an average of 15 years, Peri said.“They have family and they have kids who are American citizens normally,” Peri said. “So these are people very well integrated in the economy of California.”
More than a quarter of the state’s population was born abroad; double the national average. Nearly half of California’s children were born to an immigrant parent and more than half of California’s immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens.
Plus, California’s immigrant community is diverse: 49% are originally from Latin American countries and 41% from Asia. For the past decade, more immigrants from Asia came to California than from Latin America.After Trump directed a pause in immigration raids at farms, hotels and restaurants two weeks ago, days later he doubled down again on those industries and targeted major cities in a social media post.“We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center,” he wrote.A large business group, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, released a statement this month that said it’s “deeply concerned by recent enforcement actions that have disrupted the well-being of our communities, compromised public safety, and threatened the stability of our local economy.”Here are three ways an immigration crackdown could affect California.
Congressional seats and the electoral college
California is on track to lose at least one more congressional seat after the U.S. Census counts all the residents in the country in 2030 — and Trump’s policies on legal and illegal immigration could further erode the state’s electoral college dominance.For much of the last three decades, more residents in California have moved to other states than out-of-state residents have moved to California. But the overall population loss to out-migration is offset by the sheer number of immigrants attracted to California. Though the trend has slowed down lately, the state is home to the largest number of immigrants in the country — about a fifth of the total U.S. immigrant population.
“If that immigration stops, then that’s going to have some real consequences for our population growth and ultimately for our representation, for sure,” said Eric McGhee, a demographer and politics researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California.
By representation, he means both the number of House seats California is apportioned after the census and, by extension, the number of electoral college votes the state is given (which is calculated by adding a state’s House seats and U.S. Senate seats).
Because Congress capped the number of House members to 435 nearly a century ago, a state basically needs to grow its population at a higher rate than the national average to gain seats. California didn’t do that in the previous decade; as a result, it lost a House seat for the first time in state history in 2021. 
The electoral math concerning immigration in national elections is nuanced, though. People in the U.S. without legal authorization are counted in the U.S. Census. So, if Trump’s immigration raids lead to a large decline of people in the country without proper legal status, that affects California’s overall population. But Florida and Texas, the largest states that now regularly support Republican candidates in presidential elections, also have large numbers of people without proper legal status.California has an estimated 1.8 million here without authorization, down a million from a decade ago. Texas has 1.6 million and Florida 1.2 million. That means those states have a slightly larger percentage of people here without proper legal status than California, according to tallies by the Pew Research Center.But those states are also domestic net-migration winners; they gain more people from out of state than they lose to other states.One major reason California loses so many people is the high cost of housing. McGhee says high living costs are also increasingly a drag on the state’s attractiveness to new international arrivals.Bottomline, “if you’re interfering with immigration flows to California, that’s going to hurt the state’s growth,” said McGhee. “Unless we can somehow start to attract people back to the state  from other states and reverse that out-migration.”But “that doesn’t seem likely to happen anytime soon,” he added. 
California relies on undocumented labor
Workers without proper legal status “have allowed the economy of California to grow in many sectors,” Peri said. They work in fields that U.S. legal residents generally don’t want, either because they have higher levels of education, want higher incomes or have retired.A report released last week by UC Merced and the business-focused think tank Bay Area Council Economic Institute estimated that removing all undocumented immigrants from California would decrease economic activity by $275 billion, or 9% of the state’s GDP. That figure includes both direct labor by undocumented workers and the economic output generated by their and their employer businesses’ spending. 
In construction, mass deportations would curb GDP by 16%, and in agriculture, 14%, the report’s authors found. Undocumented immigrants make up more than a quarter of the workforce in both industries. 
They also found about 11% of the state’s small business owners are undocumented, as well as about 700,000 of the state’s homeowners — about a third of the state’s undocumented population.

“Most of this population has very deep and longstanding ties to the state of California,” said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “They’re really embedded in our economy, both in dollars and cents and institutional knowledge” on job sites.Three-quarters of U.S. registered voters — including 59% who backed Trump — said they agreed that immigrants without proper authorization mostly fill jobs that American citizens don’t want, The Pew Research Center reported in 2024.
California adults without legal authorization work at much higher rates than the overall workforce. Around 85% of California adults without authorization to stay in the country work, Peri said; the comparable figure for the state’s overall working age population is around 62%.“They don’t have access to any of the welfare support that a citizen will have, because they are undocumented, and so the only source of income for them is really work,” Peri said. That’s in spite of the fact that they contribute billions of dollars in tax revenue to local, state and federal governments, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
If Trump’s immigration raids and deportation efforts force these workers to leave, “companies will start leaving California because they cannot find the construction workers, the farm workers; hotel and hospitality will become smaller because you don’t have this type of worker,” said Peri. And companies are limited by how much more they can pay workers to attract new employees before the price of their goods exceeds what buyers can afford. That affects U.S.-born workers and legal residents, as well, who’d have fewer job openings as companies stall their growth plans.
But undocumented immigrants’ concentration in low-wage industries has also made them vulnerable. State labor officials have found undocumented immigrants to be particularly at risk of wage theft and other exploitation, and have focused their enforcement efforts in industries that disproportionately employ such workers such as car washes, garment factories and janitorial services. 
How immigrants drive California’s economy
Peri said that when we talk about immigration overall, there’s an even larger positive effect on the economy, since half of recent immigrants are college-educated and so are big players in founding companies and helping lead California in science and technology.“And so the wage impact of immigration in total, there is no evidence that is depressing wages,” he said.An immigration crackdown may prompt a growing number of would-be or recent immigrants to reconsider California or the U.S., said experts with the California Department of Finance, a state agency in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office.
They might be thinking, “why am I going to invest and build something in California or the United States?” said Somjita Mitra, chief economist in the forecasting division of the Department of Finance.Case in point: two-thirds of Silicon Valley workers were born abroad, according to a 2025 report by Joint Venture Silicon Valley. Tech companies and the high compensation they pay workers are a chief source of state revenue for California.There’s evidence that Trump’s policies slows down immigration to California. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, about 211,000 immigrants moved to California, according to data from the Department of Finance. By 2018-19, a couple of years into Trump’s first term but before the COVID-19 pandemic, that figure drops to 159,000 individuals.“Some of it is slowing down what’s happening at foreign embassies, making them come multiple times for multiple vetting sessions, slowing their processing down,” said Walter Schwarm, the finance department’s chief demographer.The figure rebounded in the latter half of Joe Biden’s presidency to more than 220,000 new international arrivals. It does not include immigrants without proper legal status.

And the vast majority of immigrants are between the ages of 28 and 40, “so they really form a core of the labor force,” he added, especially as more U.S.-born Californians retire.The country lost out on at least $335 billion in economic growth because of a slowdown in foreign-born workers between 2016 and 2022, a period that includes Trump’s first term and the COVID-19 pandemic, found Madeline Zavodny, an economist who wrote a 2024 paper for the National Foundation for American Policy.Trump’s immigration sweeps and the fear they induce are also prompting immigrants to shop and spend less, which is a drain on the economy. “If there’s a lot of uncertainty, if there’s a lot of confusion, it kind of makes people not want to go out and spend their money,” Mitra said.“The fact of the matter is, a lot of the revenue that is being generated, and a lot of the economic growth that is being generated in this country … is coming from the contributions of legal immigrants,” Schwarm said.Asked if she’s worried Trump’s immigration policies will have a detrimental effect on California’s economy, Mitra said “yes, I am worried about that.”

About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings.
The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
SC senators approve K-12 mandate that ‘a boy will use the boys’ bathroom’

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “commonsense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year.
South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law this year as part of the state budget. The mandate — initially inserted into the budget last year during the Senate’s floor debate — applies to multi-stalled school restrooms and places where students undress, to include locker rooms and gym showers.
Such directives attached to South Carolina’s state spending package — called provisos — are officially one-year laws. But they roll over from one year to the next indefinitely, unless legislators vote to take them out. There was no debate at all this year on the bathroom rule, which carries over into the fiscal year that starts Tuesday.
A lawsuit challenging it was filed in federal court last November on behalf of a transgender middle school student in Berkeley County. Attorneys for the national nonprofit Public Justice have asked for the law to be suspended pending the case’s outcome, but nothing has been decided.
In Arizona, the legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

The Legislature is considering phasing out chemical additives in school meals linked to health problems. Opponents say the definitions are so broad that it could ban items like tomato sauce and olive oil.



During the school year, kids attending schools in the Tahoe region are served cafeteria meals of ground turkey tacos, chicken or tofu bowls with brown rice, a salad bar filled with locally grown produce and other healthy items.
About 80% of breakfasts and lunches served at Tahoe-Truckee Unified School District are made from scratch without food additives such as dyes and preservatives, and nutrition workers have worked to eliminate prepackaged foods and serve minimally processed meals.
“The health of your entree is your ingredients, so we control those ingredients by cooking or making our own,” said Kat Soltanmorad, food and nutrition services director with the district.
Tahoe-Truckee Unified is part of a small but growing group of school districts in California trying to make the billion meals served in public K-12 schools every year healthier and less processed. The schools have relied on nearly $15 billion in state and federal funding over the past few years to begin making some of these changes.
Now lawmakers have set their sights on mandating improvements in school meals. A measure introduced by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino, aims to start phasing out some ultra-processed food at schools by 2028 and remove them by 2035. The bill targets foods with chemical additives, such as stabilizers, coloring and flavoring agents.
The bill doesn’t list specific foods or additives that would be banned. Instead, it tasks the state’s environmental health agency with identifying “particularly harmful” ingredients by next July. But there’s controversy brewing between the bill’s supporters and the agriculture and food manufacturing industries that worry safe products could be targeted.
For example, pizza — a favorite among students — often contains many ingredients like dough conditioners and stabilizers that manufacturers say are needed to produce the foods and keep them shelf-stable. Health experts say some are linked to cancer and other health harms. 
The bipartisan measure passed the Assembly in a 65-1 vote, with 13 members not voting, and is now being considered by the Senate. It comes on the heels of a January executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom directing the state health department to recommend how to limit harm from ultra-processed foods. The proposal also coincides with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which prioritizes chronic disease, including obesity and diabetes.
“There is a growing national awareness, particularly among parents, about how deeply what we feed our kids impacts their physical and mental health,” Gabriel said. “Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”
James Gallagher, Republican Assembly leader and co-author of the bill, said he used to be skeptical about state efforts to regulate additives like food dyes, but as he reviewed the evidence, he became convinced that kids should not consume them.
“Our kids should be eating better,” said Gallagher, a sixth-generation rice farmer from Chico. “What we all agree on really is let’s get out the most harmful ingredients that might be present in foods that are going into kids lunches.”
“Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER JESSE GABRIEL
A coalition of grocers, farmers, food and beverage manufacturers, and business groups has risen in fierce opposition to the measure. They say that creating a system that designates most groceries as ultra-processed will give consumers the false impression that their food is unsafe. 
More than 80% of products sold in grocery stores would be considered ultra-processed under the state definition, said Dennis Albiani, president of lobbying firm Capitol Advocates representing the coalition. 
“The definitions are so broad and so vague that many both healthy and determined healthy products are going to be pulled in and labeled as ultra-processed, which in the lexicon of America means dangerous and unhealthy,” Albiani said.
For example, manufacturers inject small amounts of nitrous oxide into the top of olive oil bottles to prevent the oil from oxidizing, he said. Canned goods like tomatoes and other vegetables often contain citric acid and other preservatives. Vegan and vegetarian meat supplements, which are touted as being healthy and environmentally friendly, also rely on thickeners, flavors and binders. Under the state’s proposed legislation, all of these added ingredients could classify those foods as ultra-processed, Albiani said.
First in the world to define ultra-processed
The measure would make California the first government in the world to define ultra-processed foods, according to the bill’s sponsor, the advocacy and research organization Environmental Working Group.Researchers generally consider ultra-processed foods to include ingredients like starches, fats and proteins that have been substantially modified from their original form, as well as additives like chemical binders, food dyes and flavors, and high levels of salt or sugar. Often they are high in calories and low in nutritional value.But there is no standardized definition. Under California’s definition, a food would be considered ultra-processed if it contains ingredients in nine categories: stabilizers, propellants, emulsifiers, colors, flavoring agents, flavor enhancers, surface-active ingredients, surface-finishing agents and non-nutritive sweeteners. Other food additives monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would also count.California and federal laws already include requirements that regulate the nutrition content of meals such as how much salt, fat, sugar and calories are in a serving.The measure would require the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to identify and maintain a list of “particularly harmful” ultra-processed ingredients — ones linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and other serious health problems. Schools would be required to begin phasing them out by 2028 with complete elimination by 2035. Vendors would also be prohibited from selling schools food with the identified substances.Bernadette Del Chiaro, a senior vice president with the Environmental Working Group, said the measure is “chemical neutral.” Rather than specifying which ingredients may be harmful, it allows the state’s expert toxics agency to follow the science and make that determination, she said.The legislation builds on recent laws passed in California to eliminate synthetic food dyes from school meals and certain additives from all food sold in the state that are associated with cancer, reproductive harm and behavioral problems in children. “What we’re talking about now in the 21st Century is a threat of food that isn’t really food. So it doesn’t matter if it’s low in fat or high in fat if it’s loaded with chemicals,” Del Chiaro said. Gabriel acknowledged that the bill needs work to “sharpen the definitions” as it moves through the Senate, but he also said it doesn’t ban any food, even from schools. The reality, he said, is that the environmental health agency will identify harmful ingredients that school districts and vendors will have to remove from products. “A lot of what this may boil down to is switching from one brand of oatmeal to another, or switching from this type of maple syrup product to a different product that is just maple syrup,” Gabriel said.

Although the authors say the measure is focused on school meals, Daniel Conway, vice president of government relations for the California Grocers Association, said he’s concerned that it will have implications beyond school nutrition. The ultra-processed food definition would apply to all food sold in the state even if the prohibition on “particularly harmful” ultra-processed foods is for schools only. “This is going to incorporate foods that we have otherwise been encouraging people to eat,” Conway said. “Really focus it on school nutrition and school meals, and that would go a long way to address our concerns.”Gabriel, whose previous nutrition bills have at times drawn both praise and political scorn, such as the so-called “Skittles ban,” said California’s commitment to removing harmful substances from food predates Kennedy’s rhetoric. But it helps that many of his Republican colleagues are supportive. Gallagher, the Republican co-author, said the “MAHA movement” in the Trump administration has helped give this bill momentum but agrees with Gabriel that California lawmakers have been paying attention to the issue for years. 
Link between childhood obesity and ultra-processed foods
One in five children in America is obese, and the ubiquity of processed and ultra-processed foods are a significant contributing factor, said Dr. Rohit Kohli, chief of gastroenterology at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and an expert in fatty liver disease among children.
Kohli thinks efforts to remove or limit ultra-processed foods from school meals, which low-income children in particular rely on, are a good idea. “We would see societal-level benefits from a societal change,” he said.
“In large population studies, we are seeing, unfortunately, the higher the rate of (ultra-processed food consumption) the higher the rate of obesity,” Kohli said. That’s because ultra-processed foods are usually calorie dense, he said.
Obesity and severe obesity rates among children and teens steadily increased between 1999 and 2016 in the U.S. despite some studies showing slowing growth, according to a 2018 study published in the journal Pediatrics. Severe obesity, in particular, increased among all child and adolescent age groups and populations during the study period, according to the authors. 
Children from low-income families are also more likely to have lower physical fitness and a higher risk of obesity, studies show. One of the reasons is little availability of affordable healthy food.
That makes lifestyle changes very difficult for most children and their families, Kohli said. When he speaks to overweight or obese children about their favorite foods, sugary beverages and pre-made, ultra-processed meals like pizza or fast food top the list. Those types of food are designed to be cheap, convenient and hyper-palatable, he said, which makes it hard for families to remove from their diets. 
What some schools are already doing
Some districts in California are already trying to improve upon the state and federal standards governing school meal nutrition. They’re using state grants to build new kitchens, hire chefs, train staff and renegotiate contracts with vendors and local farms.
Michael Jochner, nutrition director for Morgan Hill Unified School District, said food costs have dropped 30% over the past five years because the district switched to whole foods or “clean” packaged items. A lot of the savings come from working with local farmers, he said. 
“When you start shopping locally you have more control over the local market. You can go to a local farmer and say ‘Hey this is what I need,’ and we negotiate the price,” Jochner said. 
The changes in his district’s menu have also eliminated more than 34 pounds of sugar consumed per student each year. They did it primarily by removing sugary beverages like juice and chocolate milk and replacing sweet breakfast foods like cereal and banana bread with savory items. Breakfast includes sausage patties, bagel sandwiches and plain Greek yogurt with fruit.
Removing items high in sugar also often removed ultra-processed ingredients like binders and anti-caking agents, Jochner said. “One amazing move took out a bunch of stuff simultaneously,” he said.
In Fresno Unified School District, the third largest district in the state, 14 million meals are served to kids annually. Nutrition director Amanda Harvey said her program has also worked to reduce sugar and remove food additives. They’ve increased the whole grains served to students and do more scratch cooking. For their most popular item — a spicy chicken sandwich — they swapped out a pressed chicken patty with a breaded whole muscle, such as a thigh or breast, to eliminate a preservative that may be linked with respiratory harm and liver damage.
But Harvey said it’s unlikely any district could make 100% of meals in-house.
Schools will still need vendors, and this legislation would force them to comply or lose schools as customers. At one point, Harvey said she approached one vendor to see if it could remove several food additives and was told no.
“This would put the impetus on vendors to clean up their product,” Harvey said.

In Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Diego, homeless Californians describe their experiences over the past year as camping ban enforcement has increased. 


Deadra Walicki has lived in the same spot for more than a decade: a cracked patch of asphalt in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley, squeezed between a boarded-up grocery store and Amtrak tracks so close that passing trains shake the ground beneath her tent.The air carries the scent of diesel fumes from busy Van Nuys Boulevard below and rotten food from the dozens of garbage bags piled up near her mattress, baking in the summer sun.She stays put so that friends, family members and case workers can always locate her. But that consistency has also made Walicki, 51, a target for the police officers who patrol the area.The Los Angeles Police Department cited Walicki for violating the city’s camping ordinance at least 34 times between August 2023 and December 2024.
 “They drove through today and I waved at them,” said Walicki, her smile revealing cracked porcelain veneers. “The cops come here Monday through Friday and give tickets for being in the zone of the shelter. It’s whatever they want to do.”

It’s been 12 months since a groundbreaking U.S. Supreme Court decision rewrote the playbook on homelessness, allowing cities in California and beyond to make homeless encampments illegal, even when no shelter is available.
Before the justices ruled in Grants Pass v. Johnson, Los Angeles and other cities generally had to offer someone a shelter bed before punishing them for sleeping on the street. But that went out the window when the justices upheld an ordinance by the Oregon city of Grants Pass that banned camping on all public property. 
Since the ruling, camping-related citations and arrests have soared in cities throughout California — everywhere from Sacramento to Los Angeles to San Diego and beyond.
In each of those three cities, police are citing many of the same people again and again. And while some have managed to move indoors, many others are still camping in the same places, racking up citations that ultimately make it more difficult to find housing.
We tracked down a few of those people. Here are their stories: 
Los Angeles: 10 citations in six months
Walicki motions across the train tracks to what looks like a giant rubber bubble. It’s a transitional homeless shelter that opened in 2020.While L.A. does not have a blanket ban on public camping, the city’s main anti-camping law  allows enforcement in select sensitive locations chosen by council members, including near schools, parks and homeless shelters.L.A. Municipal Code 41.18 says people camping within 1,000 feet of a shelter can be cited. That’s what the majority of Walicki’s citations are for, but she claims the shelter is about 2,000 feet away, as the crow flies.Hope the Mission, which operates the shelter, did not dispute her distance assessment when contacted for comment, but the citations keep coming.City-led cleaning and enforcement at homeless encampments makes outreach work harder, according to the nonprofit. Outreach teams build rapport with participants only to lose track of them.“When they do this cleanup, we go back the next day, that same day,” said Hope the Mission outreach worker Armando Covarrubias. “Where can we find ’em? We can’t contact them because they have no phones.”
In recent years, L.A. city leaders have used the ordinance to designate more and more areas for anti-camping enforcement, creating a patchwork of hard-to-follow rules for unsheltered Angelenos like Walicki.
Last March, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency released a report showing L.A.’s anti-camping law has not been effective at getting people into housing or keeping encampments away: It found 94% of people targeted for removal under the ordinance wanted shelter, but only 17% were able to get it.
Los Angeles hasn’t changed its enforcement as a result of Grants Pass, according to the City Attorney’s Office. But LAPD data show the department made 68% more camping and homelessness-related arrests  in the second half of 2024 than the first. Those include non-custodial arrests, where the violator is released at the scene.
Walicki received 10 camping citations in the latter half of 2024, according to LAPD records obtained by CalMatters. She was even cited for camping two mornings in a row that October, at the same intersection.
“ People are being targeted every day in the city through enforcement, through resolutions to get them to move,” said Shayla Myers, senior attorney with Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, a nonprofit providing free legal services for poor Angelenos. “That’s the very definition of criminalization.”
When patrol cars arrive — usually in the morning, Walicki says — officers give people about 10 minutes to pack up. Anything left behind disappears into the back of sanitation trucks. Over the months, she’s lost bags of recycling she’d collected for cash, sleeping bags, clothes, even dental tools for her veneers.
Walicki lives in the encampment with her partner Steve Maroulis, a 57-year-old man with mental disabilities. The two of them want to go at the same time into two separate gender-segregated shelters, but haven’t had any luck.
“It would just be nice, for safety reasons,” she said. “And I don’t want either of us to be alone out here.”

Police records capture the chaos of tracking someone arrested so frequently. Her name appears as Deadra, Dedra, and Debra. Her last name is spelled five different ways across case files.
Each citation adds to a growing pile of legal paperwork she largely ignores. She hasn’t paid any fines because she doesn’t have the money, she said. Court dates blur together. Walicki said she’s tried to show up to court for some of her infractions, but she’s never gone on the right day.
Others have dealt with more serious consequences for camping. David Cerritos, 46, has lived in Skid Row for five years, his tattered tent on a sidewalk flanked by wholesale smoke shops in the shadow of downtown L.A.’s skyline.Cerritos was cited at least 12 times last year, including six times after the Supreme Court decision.Unlike Walicki, with her repeated citations, Cerritos has been handcuffed and temporarily detained for violating the ordinance several times, he said.“If you don’t comply, you’ll just be arrested,” he said. “And then even if you get cited out, hours later or whatever, by the time you get back, you’ve lost everything.”If someone resists, refuses to comply with or obstructs camping ban enforcement, LAPD can submit the case to be charged as a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. Otherwise, LAPD will designate it an infraction punishable by a $250 fine, according to the department’s guidelines.Several of Cerritos’ arrest records include mention of disorderly conduct. For him, these arrests usually mean spending 6 to 12 hours in jail while everything he owns disappears. Cerritos said he’s lost barbering clippers, tattoo equipment, bicycles, tools, laptops and more.LAPD submits misdemeanor cases to the L.A. City Attorney’s office for prosecution consideration, and that office ultimately decides whether to file misdemeanor charges or knock them down to infractions.The office said it filed charges in 87 camping violation cases in 2024 — 8% of the 1,034 enforcement actions LAPD made under the ordinance last year.For Cerritos and Walicki, the citations and fines don’t mean all that much. For them, any interaction with police or city workers feels like enforcement, whether a charge is issued or not.Cerritos feels like he’s getting harassed more than usual recently, but he’s not interested in moving. Like Walicki, he has a case manager but no phone. ”Now if they were forcing me to move away from here, and I went even just a block over, you might never find me,” Cerritos said.After years of frequent arrests and citations for camping, neither Cerritos nor Walicki are any closer to leaving their spots, for permanent housing or anywhere else. 
Sacramento: Go to jail, or go to a tiny home
Over the past three years, Jerry Carter could often be seen biking around Sacramento’s Midtown neighborhood, his brindle bull terrier, Zaddy, riding in style behind him on a homemade trailer he built special for the beloved pup.
Music followed him as he zipped past trendy bars and restaurants, playing R&B, jazz or reggae (never rap) from a small speaker. Sometimes he played his all-time favorite: Prince, who he saw perform at Arco Arena in 1997.
Local businesses and other homeless people who slept nearby knew him by sight, if not by name. 
The police knew Carter, too.
Over the past year, they gave him at least seven citations for camping, storing his belongings on public property and blocking the sidewalk.

Each encounter with police followed a similar playbook, Carter said. Officers showed up and told him he had 10 minutes to pack up all his belongings. Anything he couldn’t pack in time, he had to abandon. 
Carter said he lost a lot of possessions that way: bicycles, clothes, tents and more. Losing bikes stung the most: Getting hit by a car a few years ago left Carter in constant pain, making it hard to walk. But biking is easier.
Sacramento bans camping or “using camping paraphernalia” on public property. Police can cite or arrest someone if they are using a sleeping bag, or even a piece of cardboard as a mattress and a tarp as a blanket — but not if they are sleeping on a bench with no camping materials, according to a police training bulletin. 
Enforcement of that ban, as well as related ordinances, spiked after the Grants Pass decision. The number of arrests made and citations issued nearly tripled, from 96 in the first half of last year, to 283 in the second half. From January through May of this year, that number jumped to 844.
In most of those cases, the person was cited and released, not taken to jail. Violations led to an arrest 199 times in 2025.
Despite the frequent tickets and attempts to push him out of the bustling shopping and dining district, Carter never moved far from his preferred spot, around 21st and K streets. All of his citations over the past year were issued within about a two-and-a-half-block radius. He felt he had to stay central if he wanted to eat: That’s where his friends were, and where passersby would stop and give him money or food.
“I could survive there,” he said.
Carter became homeless about three years ago, after he says a property manager stole cash from his apartment while he was in the hospital. Carter moved out to avoid a physical confrontation. After that, Carter admits he “gave up a little bit.” He didn’t have the money to get a new apartment, and, focused every day on survival, he didn’t have the energy to start the process of getting back on his feet.
Initially, when the cops showed up wherever Carter was sleeping, an outreach worker would come too and put Carter on a waitlist for shelter. But nothing ever came of that, Carter said. 
Then, at the very end of December, Sacramento County opened a new tiny home community for homeless residents. The Stockton Boulevard site, which was part of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2023 promise to build tiny homes throughout California, has 155 small cabins with room for a bed (or two beds if it’s for a couple) and a few belongings. Residents share communal bathrooms with plumbing and showers. Case managers meet regularly with residents to try and help them find permanent housing. 
As the tiny homes gradually filled, one police officer started urging Carter to move in. Carter said no multiple times. He’d spent a few days in a different tiny home site last year. He hated it, he said.
Finally, the officer gave Carter an ultimatum: Go to jail, or go to a tiny home. Carter knew getting locked up meant he might lose his dog. And he’d heard the new tiny homes were actually kind of nice. So he said OK. 
“I guess he was actually a caring officer,” Carter said. “It didn’t seem like he was a caring officer, because he kept on writing tickets and everything. But he kept on just pushing me.”
Carter moved into his tiny home about two months ago, where, when he finally got to shower for the first time, it felt like he stood under the hot water for hours. He no longer has to worry about police waking him up at 6:30 a.m. and demanding that he move,  sometimes only minutes after he’d finally managed to fall asleep amidst the noise and chaos of the street.
“That’s wonderful,” Carter said. “I can actually sleep in. I can take naps.”
But the police actions that got him there also took a toll. Each time officers wrote Carter up, they gave him a piece of paper that said when he had to appear in court. But Carter invariably lost the papers. It would rain and they’d get wet and ruined. Or they’d get mixed in with the items the police tossed out the next time they told him to move. 
He didn’t think it was a big deal. After all, camping is a misdemeanor. There’s no way the court would issue a warrant for such a small offense, Carter thought. 
He was wrong. Now, at 53 years old, he has warrants out for his arrest for failing to appear at multiple court dates. It makes him worried that he could be biking down the street one day, minding his own business, and get arrested and taken to jail. 
“I’m just too old to have any type of trouble like that,” he said.

Carter’s hardly the only one in that position, said Terra Hennefer, the case manager supervisor for the tiny home site where Carter lives. 
“We see a lot of people that end up with the tickets,” she said. “Then it makes more work for us trying to clear their warrants and stuff before we get them into housing.”
Landlords often conduct background checks and won’t take someone with a warrant, Hennefer said. The county also runs background checks on people applying for subsidized housing vouchers.
Hennefer’s team works with the probation office to help residents resolve outstanding warrants. The first step is to set a new court date, and make sure the resident doesn’t miss it.
Then a judge will decide on a penalty, which could be a fine. Her organization, a shelter and interim housing provider named First Step Communities, can help cover the cost. But it’s frustrating, she said, as that money could instead go toward helping more people get off the street. And it adds yet another hurdle to what for many is a seemingly endless list of tasks on the way to housing.
Carter has just started that process. His case manager, Matthew Burbridge, is working on getting his Social Security benefits restarted and finding him permanent housing through CalAIM, the state’s expanded Medi-Cal program. 
The problem is, neither Burbridge, nor anyone else, knows how long that may take.
“They’re working on it,” he said. “It might be quick, it might be long. We don’t know. But we’ll be ready when the time comes.”
San Diego: Moving into a swamp 
Micah Huff for a time lost touch with a San Diego case manager who was trying to help him move to a city-backed homeless campsite as he sought to avoid police and encampment clean-ups.   
Huff, 45, moved to a boggy area near Ocean Beach bordered by brush, mud and city streets because it’s harder for the authorities to find him there. He had to hike in and out and said he’s already moved his belongings across the wetland once. Earlier this month, he said he expected to move again soon, as he’s done every couple weeks since the city stepped up enforcement.
Since May 2024, records show police cited Huff seven times for offenses tied to his unsheltered status and arrested him twice. 
Police data obtained by Voice of San Diego shows arrests and citations for violations tied to homelessness more than doubled in the six months after the Grants Pass ruling. Rather than the ruling, police attribute the increase to the new police chief assigning more officers to engage with community members and enforce crimes tied to homelessness. 
A year before the Grants Pass decision, the San Diego City Council approved a camping ban that police began enforcing in summer 2023, while also continuing to enforce older ordinances, such as those that prohibit encroaching on the public right of way.

The city’s street homeless population fell last year, and Mayor Todd Gloria credits that reduction to approaches such as the camping ban, continued enforcement of existing laws and increased shelter offerings and more outreach. 
Arrests can be traumatic: One of Huff’s arrests, which police records suggest may have occurred last September, has made a lasting impression on him.  
Huff was meeting a friend he hadn’t seen in a while at a dog beach in Ocean Beach. The two fell asleep near a public restroom, Huff said, and were startled awake by police. Police arrested Huff for encroachment and possession of drug paraphernalia, though Huff says the supplies weren’t his. 
Huff said his heart raced during his encounter with police. He heard an officer talk about a backpack with drug supplies. Huff’s blood pressure surged, a reaction that Huff said put him at risk of a heart attack or stroke due to a blood pressure condition. 
Then he passed out. 
Huff said police took him to Scripps Mercy Hospital in Hillcrest. Huff estimates the officers waited six or seven hours before finally giving up on booking him and leaving.
He left the hospital with medications that were stolen within a few days of his return outdoors. 
Superior Court records show that Huff has yet to be charged for these offenses or other alleged homelessness-related violations over the past couple years. 
The outcome of the city crackdowns, according to Huff, has simply been that he’s been pushed “further and further away” into remote areas — currently a literal swamp — to avoid enforcement or clean-ups. 
But increasing enforcement in recent weeks and months at nearby Ocean Beach hasn’t convinced 38-year-old Ryan Taylor to move elsewhere. Taylor, who has been cited nine times and arrested five times for offenses tied to homelessness, continues to set up an umbrella and blankets at the beach. 
One recent arrest came on Memorial Day, when Taylor was picked up on a warrant for failing to appear in court to address homelessness-related charges. He was relieved to find most of his belongings still at the beach when he returned the next morning.  
More recently, Taylor’s case manager has been helping him work on addressing his criminal cases in court. He is set to appear at a July 24 hearing to start the process. 
Taylor hasn’t left the Ocean Beach area he’s settled in for most of the four years he’s been homeless in San Diego despite the repeated arrests and citations, he said, because he’s “just accepted that’s the way that it is.” 
Taylor also said he’s repeatedly accepted offers of shelter when police show up next to him at the beach, but said shelter has never been available when he agreed to it. 
“To me, it seems like the people that need help or whatever don’t have money, giving them more tickets doesn’t help them, propel them to get them financially out of the hole or help them,” Taylor said.

San Diego police Capt. Steve Shebloski, who oversees the division focused on homelessness-related enforcement, and Denny Knox, executive director of business group OB MainStreet Association, argue that increased enforcement is having a positive effect, though both also said there’s more work to do. 
Shebloski noted recent homeless census results showing a 4% drop in unsheltered homelessness in the city and less visible homelessness in communities including San Diego’s downtown.  
But Dawn Contreras, a case manager for nonprofit PATH working with both Huff and Taylor, said the increased enforcement only makes homeless service workers’ jobs more difficult. 
One day this spring, Contreras said she was picking up an unsheltered client for a required webinar to obtain housing when a beat officer — not assigned to the Neighborhood Policing Division that Shebloski oversees — ordered her client to clear his camp. Contreras said she implored the officer to allow the man to clean the camp later so he could head to his meeting. 
“You’re not willing to bend for just one hour?” Contreras said. 
The officer refused. With Contreras’ help, the unsheltered man later signed onto his meeting a few minutes late. Rescheduling it would have added another logistical hurdle for both Contreras and her client as they prepared to move him off the street.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/082224-LA-Homeless-Camp-Sweep-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 09:02:32.273604

In some places, officials insist the events are unrelated.","In summary
In major cities and more rural areas, arrests and citations rose in the months following last summer’s Supreme Court decision. In some places, officials insist the events are unrelated.


Homeless residents of some of California’s biggest cities increasingly are facing criminal penalties for the actions they take to survive on the street, according to a first-of-its-kind CalMatters analysis of data throughout the state.
Saturday marks the one-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson, which upended California’s homelessness strategy by allowing cities to enforce blanket bans on camping — even if no shelter beds are available. Immediately after the decision, unhoused Californians and the people who help them reported seeing an increase in enforcement. But CalMatters’ reporting, gleaned from more than 100 public records requests, appears to be the first statewide effort to quantify that increase.
CalMatters analyzed data on arrests and citations for camping and other homelessness-related offenses for 2024, comparing the six months before the June 28 Supreme Court decision to the six months after. We found increases in cities throughout the state, even in those where local leaders said they didn’t change their policy as a result of Grants Pass. 
Here are some of the places with the most significant increases, according to police data:

In San Francisco, then-mayor London Breed promised to be “very aggressive” in moving encampments following the Grants Pass decision. She delivered: Arrests and citations for illegal lodging increased from 71 in the six months before the ruling to 427 in the six months after — a 500% increase.
Even though Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass spoke out against the Grants Pass decision, calling it “disappointing” and vowing to lead with housing instead of enforcement, homelessness-related arrests increased 68% after the ruling. 
Citations and arrests doubled in San Diego, which also doubled the size of its police teams that respond to homelessness.
In Sacramento, the number of citations and arrests nearly tripled – from 96 in the six months before Grants Pass, to 283 in the six months after. From January through May 2025, Sacramento police had already issued 844 citations and arrests, suggesting enforcement continues to trend upward.
Stockton issued just 14 homelessness-related citations in the six months before the Grants Pass decision. In the six months after the ruling came out, that number jumped to 213.
It wasn’t just big cities that saw more enforcement: Citations and arrests increased by more than two-thirds in Ukiah, on the North Coast, and more than doubled in Merced, in the San Joaquin Valley. 

The ruling, which found that the city of Grants Pass, Oregon did not violate the constitution by banning encampments throughout the city when no shelter was available, accelerated a shift toward a pro-enforcement approach to homelessness. Buoyed by voters fed up with large encampments near their homes, Gov. Gavin Newsom used the opportunity to urge cities to ramp up enforcement and pass anti-camping ordinances. 
The people making the case for enforcement argue it’s a type of “tough love” that’s sometimes necessary to get people off the street. If someone refuses multiple offers of help, the threat of arrest might make them finally say yes, said San Diego Police Department Capt. Steve Shebloski. 
“I hope nobody has to go to jail, and I hope everybody takes services,” he said. “I just dont think that’s the reality of where we’re at with certain individuals.”
The type of help police can offer varies widely by city and situation. In San Diego, the Homeless Outreach Team, which includes police officers as well as social workers and mental health professionals, is supposed to offer shelter before issuing citations or making arrests. Between May 2024 and May 2025, that team made 357 placements into housing or shelter, Shebloski said. People refused help 2,471 times, he said. And they accepted another form of services 3,578 times, from a referral to a treatment program, to a ride to an appointment, to a new toothbrush. The department does not track how many people wanted shelter but couldn’t get it.
In Stockton, police take a more hands-off approach: They hand out flyers with six phone numbers people can call to reach homeless shelters and other organizations.
But shelter beds aren’t always available. Last year, California had more than 187,000 unhoused residents, and fewer than 76,000 year-round shelter and transitional housing beds, according to data compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Doctors, academics and social workers who work with people on the street often say arrests make it harder for unhoused people to get back on their feet. When someone living outside gets a citation, they often miss their court date — they might lose the ticket or simply forget the date amidst the chaos of life on the street — which leads the court to issue a warrant for their arrest. People with active warrants can’t qualify for many housing and treatment programs. 
“They don’t understand. It’s not camping. It’s surviving.”Beverly Harding, 58, Sacramento
In many situations, people cited or arrested for homelessness-related crimes are never charged, or the charges are quickly dismissed. But the threat of an arrest can be just as disruptive as the arrest itself. People leave their campsites to avoid getting taken to jail, and in so doing, lose touch with the outreach workers trying to connect them with housing and other services.
“In a weird way, it undermines the housing process to such an extent that you end up working for homelessness and against the people who are experiencing homelessness,” said Brett Feldman, director of street medicine at USC. 
Some leaders are pushing back against the enforcement mindset. This week, two Democratic Congress members introduced the “Housing Not Handcuffs Act,” which would prohibit federal agencies from punishing people for living outside if they have no other option. 
Grants Pass made no difference, say cities where arrests and citations spiked
In the year since the Grants Pass decision, at least 50 cities and three counties in California passed new ordinances targeting homeless encampments, according to a recent analysis by UC Berkeley Law students and faculty. Some ban camping only in specific areas, such as near schools, waterways or levees, while others ban camping throughout the entire city. Some cities, such as Fresno, made camping a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and $1,000 in fines. 
Even cities that didn’t pass ordinances started cracking down on encampments with new vigor, using old rules. 
To quantify that crackdown, CalMatters filed more than 100 public records requests to police departments, sheriff’s offices, prosecutors and city and county governments for data on arrests, citations, charges filed and encampment removals. Those requests span a sample of about 35 large and small cities and counties throughout California. When requesting law enforcement data, CalMatters asked each agency to provide a list of the ordinances it uses to address homeless camps. In some cities that included ordinances that specifically prohibit encampments, but it could also include rules that ban sitting or lying on the sidewalk, impeding the right of way, storing belongings on public property and violating city park rules. 



Los Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman said she was surprised to see the data showing arrests related to homelessness increased 68% in her city, jumping from 920 in the six months before Grants Pass, to 1,549 in the six months after. Not all of those arrests led to someone being taken to jail. Some were what is called “noncustodial arrests,” where the person is released on site.
There were no policy changes in how the city dealt with encampments after the Supreme Court ruling, Raman said. But the city continues to expand its list of “sensitive locations,” such as near schools, where it bans encampments, she said.
“One of the city’s top priorities is to reduce unsheltered homelessness and bring people indoors and off the streets,” Raman said. “Our urgency to do that did not come from the Grants Pass decision in any way, shape or form. We were already focused on that.”
Mayor Bass’ office did not respond to requests for comment.
But Feldman, who provides medical care in encampments on the streets of Los Angeles, said he saw a noticeable change after the Supreme Court ruling. Suddenly, the areas where his team used to regularly find people were empty. That was a problem, because only about 5% of the team’s patients have reliable cell phones. If medics can’t find their patients, they can’t give them important follow-up care — such as their monthly antipsychotic injection or medicine to treat opioid addiction. As a result, their patients get sicker. 
“It was really tough for a few months,” Feldman said, though he believes enforcement has gone back down to pre-Grants Pass levels in recent months. That’s because most people have moved out of the heavily enforced areas (such as around schools) and re-settled in places that escape police notice, he said.  
The data CalMatters obtained from the Los Angeles Police Department does not include 2025 information.
San Diego similarly did not pass a new camping ban after Grants Pass. Its “unsafe camping” ordinance passed in 2023, and police also enforce older rules that prohibit encroaching on the public right of way. Shebloski says Grants Pass hasn’t changed anything in San Diego, despite the correlated increase in enforcement — 524 arrests and citations in the six months before Grants Pass, and 1,045 in the six months after. That’s because the police department added officers to its Neighborhood Police Division and Homeless Outreach Team, under the direction of its new police chief — which coincidentally lined up with Grants Pass, he said.
“I can tell you there’s absolutely zero operational direction that, ‘Grants Pass is now passed, go out there and write tickets,’” he said.
Outreach workers struggle to find clients
Beverly Harding, 58, has been on the streets for about 10 years. For the last year of that time, she was sleeping in a makeshift tent she pitched in various places along X Street in Sacramento, by attaching tarps to the shopping cart that held her food.
She still cries sometimes when recounting her run-ins with police, who she says have confiscated treasured items, including a necklace that held her mother’s ashes. An arrest last fall was particularly traumatic. A friend’s dog had bitten her wrist a few days before, and she’d gone to the hospital for treatment, she said. When the officers grabbed her injured wrist and handcuffed her, Harding said she almost passed out from the pain. She said she still gets shooting pains through her damaged wrist.
“They don’t understand,” Harding said. “It’s not camping. It’s surviving. And if you don’t have a home, where else are you going to try to survive? Anywhere you can.”

These days, the authorities are moving unhoused people around Sacramento on a daily basis, said Joe Smith. He’s the director of residential services for homeless services nonprofit Hope Cooperative and board chair for the county’s continuum of care, which coordinates the area’s response to homelessness. Because of that movement, Smith said, people are seeking out hidden spots to sleep, away from the gaze of law enforcement.
That’s making it harder for outreach workers, who have housing and other services to offer, to find their homeless clients. Smith saw that first-hand last fall. An unhoused man finally got a spot in Smith’s Hope Landing housing program after years of trying to get off the streets, but no one could find him. The program pushed his move-in date back three times, in hopes that someone would be able to track him down. 
The client eventually resurfaced and Smith was able to get him into housing earlier this month. It was just in time: A few more days, and the client would have lost the spot and had to start the entire process over. Even so, the delay meant he needlessly spent about six extra months on the street.
Smith, who was homeless himself between 2005 and 2011, said he’s “deeply concerned” the increase in enforcement is making other people lose out on housing opportunities.
“How devastating is that?” he asked. “Surviving outside becomes a lifestyle for you, and your ticket out comes up and nobody can find you. What a shame that is.”
A missing tent doesn’t mean someone has found housing
Shortly after the Grants Pass decision, then-Mayor Breed vowed to crack down on homeless encampments. What difference did the 500% increase in arrests and citations make in the city?
The number of tents and structures on San Francisco’s streets dipped to 222 in March — the lowest it’s been since the city began counting regularly in April 2019. That’s down from 360 in April 2024. 
But just because someone has ditched their tent doesn’t mean they are off the street.
“Most people are just sleeping on cardboard or on the street and moving every night,” said Chris Herring, a UCLA professor of sociology who researches homelessness in San Francisco and beyond. 
In Stockton, the city launched a “take back our parks” campaign to crack down on encampments after Grants Pass. Around the same time, the police department was recovering from a COVID-19 pandemic-era staffing shortage and increased its staffing in the departments that typically respond to homeless encampments. 
Police issued hardly any citations for violating park rules (including camping, drinking and lighting fires in a public park) or obstructing sidewalks in the six months before the Grants Pass ruling. In the six months after, police cited people for those offenses 213 times. 
Police give a 72-hour warning before they clear an encampment, said Officer David Scott, public information officer for the Stockton Police Department. If people don’t move after those 72 hours are up, officers may cite them. In rare cases, if someone is being combative, police may make an arrest instead, he said.
Police also hand out flyers with phone numbers people can call for housing, shelter beds, showers, meals and other resources. 
“We’re always going to be out there,” Scott said. “We want to provide those resources and help to those individuals that are vulnerable. And we’re going to continue the efforts in that area. But at the end of the day, we’ve got to make sure that our city is safe and as clean as we can get it.”
The flyers list numbers for six service providers (including one that’s listed twice). But there’s no guarantee any will be able to help with whatever the homeless person calling needs. St. Mary’s Community Services, one of the providers listed, had two-dozen beds available across its men’s, women’s and recuperative care programs as of June 25. A week before, it had just 11. None were available for families. 
Police have no way of tracking whether anyone calling St. Mary’s or the other providers gets help, or whether they just move a few blocks down the road and start the cycle over again. 
And for some people, police interactions don’t stop just because they’ve moved indoors.
After living on the streets for about a decade, Harding recently moved into a community of tiny homes for homeless residents in Sacramento, where case workers are supposed to help her find permanent housing. 
Shortly after, Harding and her boyfriend were hanging out in front of a nearby laundromat, using the Wi-Fi. She was downloading music onto her phone, and he was downloading games. Harding said they had a thin blanket over them, because it was cold.  
An officer showed up and told them camping wasn’t allowed there, and they had to move, Harding said.
“I said, ‘Excuse me. I’m not camping. I live next door.’”

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — Professors and students at the University of Alabama said in federal court Thursday that a 2024 state law banning DEI and so-called “divisive concepts” had chilled academic freedom and thrown funding for student organizations into uncertainty.
The testimony concluded a two-day evidentiary hearing over the law, known as SB 129, before U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor. A group of professors and students have sued the state and the University of Alabama Board of Trustees over the statute, saying it violated the First and Fourteenth amendments.
Richard Fording, a UA political science professor focusing on race and politics, said Thursday that the law has forced him to make significant changes to his courses, including reducing coverage of topics such as the Black Power movement, Black Lives Matter, and white nationalism. Fording also said it led him to cancel an undergraduate course on “Politics and Poverty.” He said he was concerned about teaching topics that could be interpreted as violating the law.
“That’s a decision I made based on everything that I witnessed since (SB 129 has) been implemented,” he said.

In two other courses, “Social Movements and U.S. Politics” and “Politics of Voting Rights,” Fording said he removed some discussions on systemic racism and oppression, central to the social movements he teaches and the history of voting rights, to avoid any student complaints and potential sanctions. He no longer assigns related readings and refrains from facilitating class discussions on these sensitive topics.
“(In) group discussions, students may express opinions that relate to divisive concepts, and because I facilitate those discussions, if those discussions become kind of one-sided, that can make a student feel like they’re being compelled to assent,” Fording said.
Cassandra Simon, a professor in the University of Alabama’s School of Social Work, testified that the law led to a class project chosen by students being abruptly canceled “the morning that we were to have it.”
Simon said that Dean Schnavia Smith Hatcher of the UA School of Social Work asked in an email for the project to be canceled because it “could be viewed as sponsoring a program that promotes DEI” by requiring “a student assent to a divisive concept” and “attend or participate in coursework that advocates” for a divisive concept.
UA professor alleges lawmaker threatened honors program budget over anti-DEI law

She disagreed and told Hatcher that the class picks the project to work on while she offers support, and that she had “never gotten into trouble.” But according to Simon, Hatcher said she would “be subject to progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination.”
“I was specifically told in an email by my administrator, my immediate supervisor, my dean, that if I did my did not have my students cancel their project that I would be subjecting myself to, in the exact words, progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination,” Simon said in a press conference Thursday.
Simon called the law vague and confusing, saying that she still does not understand why her class project was canceled.
“I still don’t understand what [SB 129] is. I am not a non-intelligent person. I have talked to many people who don’t understand what it is, all who are very intelligent and informed, and view themselves as the experts in their fields and as educators,” she said.
Both professors said that while they were not directly told to change their courses to comply with SB 129, they did so out of caution due to UA’s administration treatment of Dana Patton, a director of the Witt Fellows Program and a political science professor at the University of Alabama who testified Wednesday, during an investigation of anonymous complaints that claimed the program was “embedded” with “divisive concepts.” In her testimony, she detailed an intense investigation she faced after the university received an anonymous complaint.
“I felt like the administration should have determined if it actually was students in my course who complained and talked to other students in my class, because I was being accused of violating the law, and that complaint came from the state legislature, so I felt like there should have been a little bit more investigation into that,” Patton said in a press conference Thursday.
Students who testified in Thursday’s hearing said that SB 129 has also impacted funding for school organizations that may potentially promote “divisive concepts.”
Sydney Testman, a University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) political science student, said that the Social Justice Advocacy Council (SJAC) was “demoted” from a “university funded organization” to a “registered student organization” after SB 129’s implementation, which meant that they no longer automatically received funding from UAB. Because the organization lost funding, her role as finance coordinator, which provided her and other student leaders with a yearly stipend, was also terminated.
Miguel Luna, a UAB student studying political science and history, testified that his organization, Esperanza, which focuses on Hispanic and Latine students, relied on funding from the former Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), which was rebranded as the Office of Access and Engagement to comply with SB 129, and other organizations like SJAC. 
Since the anti-DEI law was implemented, he said he lost access to those funds and could no longer provide incentives like food at events, leading to a decline in the events they have hosted.
“Many other student organizations have also found that when you provide incentives, people will attend, especially the off campus people that you’re trying to reach,” Luna said.
During cross-examination by Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the UA Board of Trustees, Luna acknowledged that Esperanza did not apply for direct USGA funding in the most recent academic year, partly because the deadline had passed and he believed, based on his experience on the executive council of USGA, that Esperanza would not be eligible due to its mission.
Judge Proctor asked why the organization didn’t submit the application anyway.“What would have been involved in submitting? Why not take a chance? Why not take the effort, submit the application, get a ‘no,’ rather than assume,” Proctor asked.
Ja’coby Bibbs, a UA political science student and president of the UA chapter of the NAACP student chapter, detailed the historical significance and practical benefits of the Black Student Union (BSU) and the LGBTQ+ center that was closed in August to comply with SB 129. He said the BSU office, located on the first floor of the Student Center, served as a hub for fostering connections, mentorship, and community among Black students and other minority groups.
“The Black Student Union space was invaluable to my experience, to my success at the University of Alabama,” Bibbs said, adding that the space helped him in his application to the Blackburn Institute, a prestigious leadership development and civic engagement program for UA students. He emphasized that the BSU space was open to all students, regardless of race or ethnicity, and did not require membership or a fee for entry.
Bibbs recounted an incident involving racist text messages sent to Black students on campus, stressing that the absence of the BSU space deprived students of a place to “cultivate and really digest what was happening.” He described the BSU as “an ode to the trailblazers who came before us,” including the first Black students and professors at the university.
The BSU space was a place where “people who get me, people who look like me, understand what I’m going through,” Bibbs said.
Proctor indicated he wants to decide whether to issue an injunction before class starts in August and might rule on the state’s motion to dismiss after. An oral argument hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250626_1731190742-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Early morning May 22, 2025, when most families were still asleep, members of the U.S. House passed a bill to make sweeping cuts to Medicaid, SNAP — which helps people afford groceries — and other basic safety net programs, all to finance tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country. 
A Senate vote is imminent.
The 215 representatives who voted for this bill said “yes” to kicking over 13 million people off their health care through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, while raising costs for millions of others. These representatives said “yes” to ransacking the pantries and clearing off the dinner tables of 3 million families on SNAP who are struggling to get by. These representatives said “yes” to taking away school lunches from 18 million kids. 
In Minnesota, the effects of these cuts will be devastating. Fully $11 billion of the $18 billion that Minnesota spends on Medicaid comes from the federal government. Cutting these funds will leave people without access to doctors and the medicines they need to survive. SNAP serves over 450,000 Minnesotans who are trying to make it to another day.
These 215 of our U.S. representatives said “yes” to endangering the health, livelihood and well-being of millions of families, all to reconcile their budget that seeks first and foremost to cut taxes benefiting the top 1%, who already pay in too little compared to other developed countries. 
This is a cruel, fiscally irresponsible and wildly unpopular budget bill. 
Touting this as a “beautiful” bill is disingenuous and brazen. There is nothing beautiful about denying people cancer treatment. There is nothing beautiful about children going hungry. There is nothing beautiful about prioritizing those already well off at the expense of families just trying to get by.  Should this bill become law, it will cause irreparable damage to families.  
Not in our name
As faith leaders and members of our community, we cannot remain silent to the cruelty unfolding that denies the humanity and dignity of our families, congregants and neighbors. Our policies and our budgets reflect what we value. Yet, what House members passed in the budget bill — and what the Senate is currently considering — defies the values of the vast majority of Americans. No matter our worldview or ideology, most of us recognize the wisdom of the Golden Rule.  
It is troubling to see politicians who claim to be Christian govern in a way antithetical to the core values of the teachings of Jesus.
Biblical writings emphasize again and again the importance of caring for one another, particularly the sick, hungry and vulnerable.  
But do you know what you won’t find in the Bible? Instructions to deny sick people care. A parable advocating for letting a child go hungry. A proverb praising a rich man for stepping on others to amass more wealth for himself. 
Our faith tradition doesn’t only emphasize caring for vulnerable people in our communities because it’s right — and it absolutely is. Our faith tradition emphasizes it because over millennia, societies and people in power needed to be reminded again and again when they lost their way of caring for one another.
To the 215 representatives who voted for the House bill: You most certainly have lost your way. 
Another moral crossroads
We are at another moral crossroads in our country. Will we have a government that makes life better for all? Or will we have a government that aims above all to further enrich the rich on the backs of working families? 
Will we allow our elected leaders to continue to draw sharper, wider lines between the “haves” and “have-nots,” or will we embrace budgets that ensure everyone is better off by making sure everyone has their basic needs met? 
As a country, we have faced identity crises before — of who we are and what we stand for. We’ve wrestled with dark parts of our history tainted by injustice, cruelty and prejudice. We’ve expanded rights, freedoms and protections for those who were too long denied them. Frankly, we’re still wrestling. But we’ve risen to the occasion before, and we must do so now again. 
What the passage of the House bill signals is grave but not guaranteed. 
The House bill passed narrowly by one vote (215-214), four of whom were Minnesota representatives. Now the Senate is deliberating. You can contact your Congress members. You can urge senators to think hard about the budget bill that cuts people’s health care and food assistance. 
If your representative voted for the House bill, politely ask them what kind of government they want to have a hand in making. 
If and when it comes to the House again, insist they do better.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medicaid-rural.jpg,,,2025-06-27 09:02:32.273604

The Hallsville School District was asking for a $6.5 million bond issue to finance more parking for the growing high school, a new elementary classroom and increased security for schools. And on April 8, nearly 75% of voters approved the measure, and the district launched pre-construction and design work.
But the project came to a halt the afternoon of June 6 when Superintendent Tyler Walker learned the district hadn’t met public-notice requirements before the election. So their bond counsel, the law firm Gilmore & Bell, couldn’t submit the bond issue for certification to the Missouri State Auditor’s Office.
“This was not the fault of the school district,” Walker told The Independent, “yet the school district and the students we educate are unfortunately being punished.”
Hallsville is the only school district to publicly acknowledge issues with its bond measure, but there could be as many as 10 political subdivisions forced to throw out the results of the April election.
Mark Grimm, an attorney with Gilmore & Bell, said in a June 3 email to the auditor’s office that eight to 10 of his firm’s clients may need to put voter-approved bonds back on the ballot because they appear to have fallen short of the state law laying out public notice requirements in the run up to an election. 
 Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick speaks to reporters about a critical report of the Secretary of State’s office on Jan. 23, 2024 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Notice of a bond issue must be published in local newspapers twice — once two weeks prior to the election and again within one week of the election. In each instance, Grimm wrote, notice ran three and two weeks before the election.
Exactly which bond measures are in jeopardy isn’t clear. The firm couldn’t comment on specifics about its clients, and the auditor’s office — which must certify that local bond measures comply with state law — was not provided with a list.
In an interview with The Independent, Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick said the state law is clear. The last thing he wanted to do was disqualify a voter-approved measure, Fitzpatrick said, but his hands are tied because public notice requirements are very specific and allow no flexibility. 
“If we’re aware of the deficiency,” he said “we can’t knowingly certify that the bonds comply with all the laws.”
Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Shell Knob, acknowledged similar issues with public notice have gone undetected over the years. In fact, an $8.5 million bond measure for the Centralia R-VI School District, Hallsville’s neighbor to the northeast, was certified with similar problems.  
The office has historically relied on bond attorneys like Gilmore & Bell, Fitzpatrick said, to ensure their clients are in compliance with state laws before submitting paperwork for certification. While his staff ensures publication takes place, “it was not part of our process to closely check the dates of the publications.”
“There’s a level of trust that has been historically built into this process,” he said, “because this is a sporadic thing. It’s not something where we have a team of people sitting around all day and their only job is to review these bonds and check every single law.”
Bill Burns, general counsel for Gilmore & Bell, doesn’t agree with the auditor’s position. He believes Missouri law gives Fitzpatrick enough wiggle room to certify voter-approved bonds despite “minor deficiencies relating to publication notices that would not in any way affect the outcome of the election.”
But Fitzpatrick said the law firm should have been on the lookout for these sorts of problems after a dust up in February involving the Higbee Fire Protection District — another Gilmore & Bell client — resulted in a bond measure being refused certification over similar issues. 
“I am surprised that we’re dealing with this now,” he said. “I would expect that bond counsel will be more proactive and communicate with the county clerk on these deals moving forward to make sure the publication dates are where they need to be. But I would have also thought that following the February deal.”
 Higbee Fire Protection District

Over the course of two elections last year, voters in Randolph County approved $1.6 million in bonds to support the Higbee Fire Protection District. It was only supposed to take one election, but the county clerk put the wrong total on the August ballot, requiring the rest of the bonds to be approved in November. 
By February, all that was left for the bonds to finally be issued was the certification of the auditor’s office.
And that’s where things went sideways.
Fitzpatrick’s staff kept asking for a copy of the sample ballot that was published in the newspaper prior to the election. Erick Creach, an attorney with Gilmore & Bell representing the district, instead sent affidavits attesting that the county clerk published a sample ballot.
As it turns out, the reason Creach couldn’t share a copy of the sample ballot was because it was never published as required by law. 
“Erick called first thing this morning,” wrote Leslie Korte, general counsel for the auditor’s office, in a Feb. 26 email obtained by The Independent through Missouri’s Sunshine Law. “He admitted that despite their prior representations and the certification of the clerk, they in fact did not publish the notice as required. For any election. He basically wanted us to let that slide.”

Korte wrote that she informed Creach that the auditor “cannot certify a bond that we know does not comply with state law.”
“I also addressed the secondary issue, which is Gilmore & Bell sending us documents certifying to facts that are not true, and him providing us documents yesterday afternoon identifying them as something they are not,” she wrote. “I told him all bond packages we receive from them going forward will be under heightened scrutiny, and if anything like this happens again, how it is addressed by our office will be escalated.”
Creach responded later that day reiterating that sharing the affidavits wasn’t an attempt to fool anyone but rather to “keep your office updated as I was piecing together the information, which to your point should have been addressed prior to submission of the transcript in the first place.”
The firm, Creach wrote, will “have a call today internally to discuss best practices regarding submission of transcripts and review of documentation to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.”
Fitzpatrick said in an interview this week that Gilmore & Bell “kind of intended to mislead us on that one, and we were unable to certify those bonds because no publication took place.”
 Brookfield R-III School District

In May, the auditor’s office refused to certify bonds for the Brookfield R-III School District in Linn County, again due to public notice deficiencies. 
Though the school district was not a Gilmore & Bell client, the firm took note and decided it would “submit certain hypothetical fact situations” to the auditor in the hopes of clarifying what could disqualify a bond measure, said Burns, the firm’s general counsel. 
One of the hypotheticals the firm submitted was publication three weeks and two weeks before the election. The auditor’s office confirmed it would not certify under those circumstances. 
Grim responded that “we believe there are 8-10 bond elections from April for political subdivisions we represent where the election authority complied with all publication requirements except the publications fell slightly outside of the two week/one week provision.”
One of those was Hallsville. 
“While we definitely agree that good public policy is to ensure compliance with election laws,” Grimm wrote, “failing to register bonds due to election law technicalities has the result of effectively annulling an election.”
He requested the auditor’s office consider certifying bonds regardless of the public notice issue, with the understanding that “going forward, no such grace will be provided.” And he noted the auditor’s office had just certified a bond for one of the firm’s other clients, Centralia, that had the exact same deficiencies. 
Korte responded in a June 4 email that for Centralia, the auditor’s office “relied on the representation of bond counsel that the bonds complied with all state laws, including state law that dictates when those publications must take place.”
Given the number of state laws that exist to cover the issuance of bonds, Korte wrote, it would not be surprising if over the years a bond was certified “despite having an unknown or undisclosed legal defect.”
“That should never be taken as a tacit approval of any failure to comply with state law,” she wrote. “If anything, it should be used by bond counsel as a cautionary tale causing them to double down on their efforts to ensure they are monitoring their clients’ bonds and advising on how to issue bonds in full compliance.”
 Hallsville School District

Boone County Clerk Brianna Lennon, who oversees elections including publishing notices,  told The Independent that her office intentionally chose to publish sample ballots three and two weeks before the election.
“We have tried, especially this past time, to make sure that we have some (safeguard),” she said. “So if there is a mistake that’s made in one of the weekly papers, we still have a grace period to be able to publish.”
A changing newspaper industry has made it harder to publish sample ballots. After a local paper was bought by a large corporation, Lennon’s office struggled to get edits made of notices and receive proofs prior to printing.
Lennon didn’t think her notice strategy would run into statutory issues, since the heart of the law is to ensure voters are informed. Her office goes beyond the law’s requirements and sends sample ballots in the mail to voters and posts them online in advance of all elections.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hallsville plans on resubmitting the bond issue for November’s election, which Walker estimates will cost the district “between $10,000 and $20,000.” Until the issue is funded and approved by the state, no payment is due to Gilmore & Bell.
The cost of delaying construction isn’t quantifiable, he said, and will cause “significant planning issues for the district,” with improvements critically needed.
“The safety and education of our students is of utmost importance to all of us in Hallsville,” he said.
Walker felt he had no reason to doubt the district’s bond counsel, since Hallsville previously passed three bond issues with Gilmore & Bell’s assistance, and he knew the firm’s reputation as “one of the best.”
“Districts rely on bond counsel because the process to pass a bond issue and finance a successful issue is a complicated one,” he said. “It requires the assistance of a bond counsel to navigate the legal and financial complexities that are involved in the process from start to finish.”
Fitzpatrick said his office will begin requiring bond counsel to sign an affidavit when submitting paperwork for certification of a bond measure “basically saying that, to the best of their knowledge, all laws have been complied with.”
State lawmakers have also reached out to him, Fitzpatrick said, with interest in changing the public notice law when the legislature reconvenes in January. Burns said his firm agrees that the law needs to be adjusted. 
“The main thing I think that really needs to be changed is becoming more lenient with the date of the publication,” Fitzpatrick said, adding: “There’s a lot of kind of antiquated aspects of it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/money-e1750989760274-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

,California,2025-06-27 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Five years later, the pandemic still weakens two California employee safety nets",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/pandemic-california-employee-safety-net/,"The state still hasn't fixed problems with its unemployment and workers compensation funds, both of which faltered during the COVID pandemic and haven't recovered.","When the COVID-19 pandemic struck California five years ago, it massively impacted California families not only medically but economically.
As the state forced many businesses to close their doors, 3 million Californians lost their jobs, shooting the state’s unemployment rate up to more than 16%. In turn, two state programs that are supposed to cushion employees from the effects of workplace disruption were hard-hit.
The most obvious impact is what happened to the state’s unemployment insurance program.
As workers were laid off, they filed claims for weekly benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, which is financed by employers through payroll taxes.
However the fund, which had been struggling to pay claims prior to the pandemic, was soon exhausted, and the state borrowed about $20 billion from the federal government to keep benefits flowing.
The Employment Development Department also suffered a managerial implosion, leading to not only the blockage of payments to legitimate claimants, but billions of dollars in payments, mostly out of federal funds, going to fraudsters.
Five years later, not only has the state been unable to claw back the billions in fraudulent payments, but the state’s unemployment fund’s debt to the federal government has continued to grow. Interest charges are piling up, and there’s still a gap between income and outgo even though the state’s unemployment rate today of 5.3% is about a third of what it was in 2020.
The Employment Development Department estimates that the debt will rise to $23.7 billion by the end of 2026, even though federal officials have raised their payroll taxes in California to chip away at the debt. Underlying the issue is a decades-long political stalemate over unemployment insurance benefits and taxes.
The other safety net program affected by the pandemic is workers’ compensation, which provides medical treatment and support payments to employees suffering job-related illnesses and injuries.
Most employers purchase insurance either from private insurers or from the quasi-public State Compensation Insurance Fund to cover employee claims. Some big employers, including state and local governments, self-insure for “work comp,” as it’s dubbed.
An estimated 200,000 work comp claims were filed by COVID-19 victims, even though a connection between the disease and the workplace is tenuous at best.
Nevertheless, those claims and sharp increases in medical costs are being cited by the insurance industry’s Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau in seeking an 11.2% increase in employer-paid insurance premiums, tentatively approved by the state Department of Insurance to take effect on Sept. 1.
It’s the latest chapter in the long-running political friction over work comp costs and benefits, which collectively approach $20 billion a year.
Roughly once a decade, the major players in the work comp system — employers, insurers, unions, work comp attorneys and medical care providers — clash over the issue. The last time was in 2012, when then-Gov. Jerry Brown negotiated a compromise that raised benefits but imposed new rules on eligibility for benefits and medical care to save enough money to pay for the increases.
Although opposed by medical providers and attorneys, the deal had the desired impact, including a sharp reduction in insurance costs vis-à-vis payrolls. However, California’s insurance costs, 1.86% of payroll, remain among the highest in the nation, according to a biennial survey by the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, widely considered the most authoritative source of work comp premium data.
The stage would seem to be set for another of the Capitol’s periodic work comp clashes. However, legislation that would have increased cash benefits to disabled workers never made it through the first committee this year, so the contending forces will face off sometime in the future.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/102423-Unemployment-Insurance-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Roberts, 59, is scheduled to be put to death Aug. 21 by nitrogen gas. He is the fourth person the state will put to death this year and the third using that method of execution.
A Marion County jury convicted Roberts of two counts of capital murder in December 1992.
According to court documents, Jones was sleeping at her boyfriend’s den, Wendell Satterfield, where Roberts was also staying. Roberts left his job and went to the Setterfield residence. He packed his belongings, stole money from Jones and shot her three times in the head using a rifle, then set the residence on fire.
The jury voted 7-5 to recommend Roberts be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge overruled the recommendation and sentenced him to death.
After an appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court to allow Roberts to present mitigating evidence in hopes of a reduced sentence. In a second penalty phase, the jury again recommended life in prison, and the trial judge again overrode the recommendation and imposed a death sentence.

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Steep fines in Iowa set off state-federal showdown over child labor laws

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader.
Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Nevada holds 1.4 billion barrels of “undiscovered” oil beneath its public lands – only falling behind Alaska and New Mexico – and 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas, according to the newly compiled figures released by the U.S. Geological Survey last week.
“We think there’s resource potential there, and it just so happens there’s a lot of federal land,” said Chris Schenk, the lead author of the report.
The estimates are of “technically recoverable oil and gas resources” — many of which may not be economically viable to extract — that could be retrieved with current technologies. It’s the first time the agency has tallied the amount of oil and gas under national parks, wilderness areas and other public lands nationwide since 1998.
Technology has improved significantly since then, increasing the estimated resources that could potentially be extracted from public lands, according to the report.
The analysis was prepared in response to a directive by the Trump administration to “unleash” domestic energy supplies. In February, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed his agencies to identify energy and critical minerals on public lands.
“American Energy Dominance is more important than ever, and this report underscores the critical role science plays in informing our energy future,” Burgum said in a press release announcing the study.
The report also comes as Republicans in Congress try to push a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Nevada, Utah and other Western states.
Nationally, the analysis estimated 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.6 trillion cubic feet of gas lie below all federal lands – enough oil to meet the county’s needs for four years and a dozen years in the case of natural gas.
The last federal analysis of undiscovered oil and gas resources on public lands in 1998, estimated about 7.8 billion barrels of oil and 201 trillion cubic feet of gas. 
Schenk, the lead author of the report, said the analysis uses decades of federal data to estimate the potential for oil and gas where it hasn’t been discovered yet, but there’s still room for “uncertainty.”
“Whenever you’re exploring for resources, whether it’s minerals or oil and gas, there’s uncertainty before you drill,” Schenk said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, because it’s undiscovered.”
That uncertainty is reflected in the lack of oil and gas leasing in Nevada, despite available data pointing to potential sources in the state.
Nevada lease sales have long drawn little interest from industry. It’s not uncommon for large swaths of nominated land to never get a bid.
For example, the Bureau of Land Management offered five oil and gas parcels in Nevada totaling 6,800 acres this week. None of the parcels received a single bid. Those same parcels also failed to attract any industry interest in 2023 and 2024.
“We recognize that interest in Nevada is lower than other states in the West where development is more economical, such as New Mexico and Wyoming. The scale of this auction, for instance, was small relative to others,” said Aaron Johnson, the vice president of public and legislative affairs for the Western Energy Alliance trade group.
When land does get leased for oil and gas development, it underperforms in auction. From 2015 to 2024, the average bid per acre in Nevada was just $4.10—compared to $4,900 per acre in New Mexico.
Still, the Trump administration has pushed to lease more of Nevada’s public lands including 264,000 acres of public land in Elko County’s Ruby Mountains, a popular hunting and outdoor recreation site in Nevada. 
Drilling opponents remain skeptical that there’s much oil and gas in Nevada or that extracting it would make economic sense any time soon. They think the development push is rooted in speculation. 
“We’ve been leasing these low potential lands since the 1950s,” said Russell Kuhlman, the executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation. “We have yet to find anything that would get the oil and gas industry excited.”
Kuhlman said speculative oil and gas leasing in Nevada removes land that would be better suited for the recreation economy, wildlife conservation, or renewable energy development in the state.
Over 90 percent of public lands managed by the Interior Department in Nevada are available to be leased for oil and gas drilling. Once leased, public lands are locked up from being managed for multiple uses such as outdoor recreation and conservation for the life of the lease, which could be 10, 20 or even 30 years.
“That’s really where the issue is, once land is identified as an oil and gas lease, it’s essentially put in that folder and forgotten about by the Bureau of Land Management,” Kuhlman said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/snow-1024x625.png,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Paul Sarlo, the state Senate's budget chair, said Thursday that when lawmakers eye certain tax hikes, it's ""always a difficult ask and a difficult choice to make.""  (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Budget panels in both legislative chambers approved a series of tax increases on Thursday meant to keep New Jersey’s books balanced in the fiscal year that begins July 1, but legislators stopped short of a vote on the full budget.
Lawmakers advanced proposals that would raise fees on the sale of certain expensive buildings, hike cigarette and nicotine taxes, and push up tax rates on online gambling and sports betting in a bid to keep the state’s budget above water.
Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate budget chairman, said the tax hikes would help Gov. Phil Murphy keep his pledge to pass along a $6 billion surplus to the next governor. Murphy leaves office in January.
“Any time you have to tax an industry or ask someone to put more money in, it’s always a difficult ask and a difficult choice to make,” Sarlo said.
The full budget did not get a vote Thursday, with lawmakers saying the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services was still drafting the bill after negotiators reached an agreement on how much New Jersey would spend in the next fiscal year.
Budget committees are expected to vote on the bill at 8 p.m. Friday, with votes before both full chambers planned for Monday, the last day they have to pass a budget without shutting down the state government.
Republican members, who broadly opposed the tax bills advanced Thursday, expressed some frustration over the budget process, noting the timing of the committee’s vote on the budget bill made it likely that few would see the vote.
“This overall process, none of us is happy with,” said Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth), the chamber’s GOP budget officer. “If you got something you want to release in the dark of night when no one’s paying attention, everybody knows you put it after 4:30 on a Friday in the summer.”
Among the tax hikes approved Thursday was a bill that would raise tax rates on online gambling and sports betting to 19.75%, from 15% and 13%, respectively. The proposal, earlier reported by the Press of Atlantic City, resembles a pitch the governor made in his budget address that called for the state to raise tax rates on online gambling to 25%.
The governor’s proposal was set to generate $402.4 million in additional revenue in the coming July-to-June fiscal year. The reduction from 25% to $19.75% would reduce those collections by about $85 million.
“Any time there’s anything that could negatively impact our casinos in Atlantic City, we want to just raise our concerns because Atlantic City is kind of the powerhouse of South Jersey, and we don’t want to do anything to impact their competitiveness with other states,” said Hilary Chebra, director of government affairs for the Chamber of Commerce of South Jersey. “We do appreciate that it is less than what the governor proposed.”
Some lawmakers have pushed to raise the state’s tax rates on casinos’ online gambling winnings, noting that New Jersey’s existing rates are far out of step with its neighbors. New York levies a 51% tax on casinos’ winnings from online sports betting, while Pennsylvania’s online sports betting rate is 36%.
Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex), the bill’s prime sponsor, initially pitched raising New Jersey’s rates to 30%.
Legislators made broader changes to a separate Murphy proposal that would have doubled the 1% fee on property sales valued above $1 million and imposed an overall 3% fee on those worth more than $2 million.
Under the Legislature’s version, the fee would remain at 1% for homes worth between $1 million and $2 million but rise for more expensive homes, climbing to 2% for homes worth between $2 million and $2.5 million and rising by an additional half percentage point for every $500,000 in value, to a cap of 3.5% on property worth more than $3.5 million.
“This is one thing I wish didn’t have to be included, but I also fully understand the need to balance a budget, provide necessary revenue, to continue to work down our structural deficit, to provide a healthy surplus,” Sarlo said.
Lawmakers made another significant change: Their version of the tax would be paid by sellers rather than by buyers, as is the case under current law. The change would reduce owners’ profits from the sale of property but reduce upfront costs for home buyers.
Murphy’s proposal was expected to generate $317 million in additional state revenue in the next fiscal year, though revenue relying on home sales can be highly volatile. Sarlo said legislators’ version would raise about $282 million and impact between 2% and 3% of home sales.
The bill calls for the state to refund the difference in fees for a property that was sold before July 10 and whose deeds were recorded no later than Nov. 15, 2025.
The committee’s vote on the so-called mansion tax measure was delayed by hours. When it first came up for a vote, the panel’s Republican members had not seen the current version. When it was brought up a second time hours later, the measure had been amended again to allow additional time for homes to be sold and face the lower fee.
Lawmakers also approved a bill that would raise the state’s cigarette tax to $3 per pack, from $2.70, and triple tax rates on electronic cigarette cartridges to 30 cents per milliliter or 30% of the retail price for bottled fluid.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sarlo-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

It used be that we tried to make America great by making it a vibrant, welcoming, open, prosperous place where we were proud to welcome people from other places.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: Wresting people from their families is no way to solve our border problem.","This commentary is by David Moats of Salisbury. He is editorial page editor emeritus of the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.


Three federal judges in Vermont have played a leading role in trying to establish constitutional protections against the unlawful seizure and imprisonment of people by arbitrary government force.
These three cases are a small sample of the vast program of immigration enforcement launched by President Trump in order to deport thousands of immigrants to El Salvador or South Sudan or wherever he can send them. Such a program could not be anything but brutal. Justice takes time — to hold hearings and consider individual cases. We are all individuals deserving of justice, and our immigration status does not alter that constitutional reality.
The cruelty of the program has become apparent to millions of Americans who turned out in all 50 states on June 14 to declare that America is not a nation of kings.
By the logic of the Trump administration, all those millions could well have been rounded up and imprisoned in some vast gulag. After all, the administration has advanced the idea that protest itself may be antithetical to the national interest. And dissenting views seemed to be the only specified basis for the seizure of foreign nationals in two of the Vermont cases.
One of those foreign nationals, Mohsen Mahdawi, is a lawful resident of Vermont and a student from Columbia University, where he was also a pro-Palestinian activist. His activism, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, could “potentially undermine” U.S. foreign policy.
The absurdity of Mahdawi’s arrest, and of Rubio’s claim, was compounded by the fact that masked and armed ICE agents seized him after he had turned up in Colchester for a citizenship interview. In other words, he was doing everything right. While in prison, he has said he felt empathy for his father and other relatives on the West Bank who had been imprisoned by Israelis. But as it turned out, U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford saw no justification for his detention and ordered his release.
In another case, a Turkish woman, Rümeysa Öztürk, was grabbed off the street in Somerville, Mass. by masked government agents and whisked away in a car. In ordering her release from a Louisiana detention center, U.S. District Judge William Sessions found the government’s justification for her detention to be pathetically weak. What had she done? She had co-authored an op-ed piece for a student newspaper supporting Palestinian rights. 
But of course, this is what people in America do — they express wide-ranging views on issues of their choosing. Rather than undermining American policy, this freedom is a bulwark of our democracy, drawing people here from all over the world, seeking to participate in that freedom. The Johnson and Nixon administrations thought that dissent on the Vietnam War was inimical to American interests, even if history proved that dissent on the war was pointing the nation in the right direction. 
In a third case, U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss found that there was no basis for the government’s case against Russian scientist Kseniia Petrova, whom it had held in detention for four months. She had entered the country with frog embryos obtained from a lab in France to further her research at Harvard Medical School. Not only was her detention illegal, but it represented a further chilling assault on science. The most brilliant scientists from abroad have long sought to come to the United States, but now they are wondering why they should.
Vermonters are familiar with these three cases. But multiply them by the thousands, and we gain an understanding of the outpouring of protest in downtown Los Angeles, and in other cities, as well as the recent No Kings marches in every state. Brutality seems to be not an accident, but a feature of the administration’s policy.
It was on display in the manhandling and cuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla. His crime? Showing up at a press conference and daring to ask a question of Kristi Noem, secretary of homeland security. That was followed later by the manhandling of Brad Lander, New York City comptroller, also on a bogus charge.
It used to be that public officials knew how to handle questions that made them uncomfortable. It was part of their job. Now the job seems to be the deployment of force to send the message that dissent won’t be tolerated.
Except dissent is spreading in all parts of the country. Wresting people away from their families, sending them off to who-knows-where — this is not right, and it is no way to solve the border problem. The government will argue that making life miserable for foreigners here will dissuade others from coming.
It used be that we tried to make America great by making it a vibrant, welcoming, open, prosperous place where we were proud to welcome people from other places. Not American carnage, but America the beautiful.

Like marriage, love unites. And, ten years after Obergefell, I’ve come to see that love doesn’t just win — it transcends.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Meg York: Reflections on 10 years of marriage equality.","This commentary is by Meg York of Montpelier. She is director of LGBTQ+ family law and policy and senior policy counsel at Family Equality. She recently advocated for updated protections for LGBTQ+ families in Vermont — confirmatory adoption — a bipartisan effort signed into law by Gov. Phil Scott in May.


Jocelyn hugged her knees to her chest as she sat on the floor. I sprawled on the industrial carpet, gazing at her curling hair, her soft blue eyes, her awkward cuteness. It was a queer-straight alliance meeting. She was there as queer. I was a straight ally, or so I thought.
Raised in a conservative, evangelical home, being queer never crossed my mind. When something’s not an option, you don’t consider it. But in my mid-twenties, I began to reconsider myself.
Jocelyn and I became fast friends, doing everything together. We spent time outdoors, organized reproductive rights demonstrations and marched in the streets over the unjust outcome of Proposition 8, which banned same-sex couples from marrying in California where we lived. We laughed. We cried.
I came out as a lesbian.
My parents were shocked. They asked why I was choosing to hurt them. They admonished me not to tell my extended family. “Love the sinner, hate the sin,” they said — except none of it felt like love.
Early mornings, Jocelyn and I would walk together. We recited Mary Oliver poems and planned our wild and precious lives. Days turned into months, months turned into years. We found a new version of love. I am going to marry this woman, I thought.
We got engaged on a bridge in Central Park. I had never seen Jocelyn smile so brightly. In early spring, the trees were just beginning to bud. Jocelyn adorned her hair with little pink flowers. I took photo after photo. I couldn’t get enough of her.
We were in love, but our families were in turmoil. “It’s not God’s plan,” they cried. Though Jocelyn’s parents were more supportive than mine, their acceptance had limits. “Maybe if you just don’t call it a wedding…” We hugged, grieved, and moved to Vermont — one of the few states at the time with the freedom to marry.
We were married in 2012 in Chester. It was just Jocelyn and me. It was beautiful and painful. We longed to be surrounded by friends and family.
For several years, we enjoyed newlywed bliss and navigated administrative challenges. We hiked, swam, skied and paid extra for health insurance because federally, I wasn’t Jocelyn’s spouse. Evenings, we danced in the kitchen, the aroma of cast-iron cooking in the air. We filed taxes, jointly (Vermont) and single (federal). It was love, marriage and enough red tape to make anyone’s head spin.
In 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges affirmed the freedom to marry nationwide and struck down state-level bans. At the same time, my parents were beginning to come around. We breathed a sigh of relief.
Five years into our marriage, we shared that we were trying to get pregnant. My parents fell silent. “Kids need a mom and a dad, Meg.” It felt like the progress we had made was falling away. Like a road in Vermont. Like mud season.
But then, spring arrived: My daughter was born, and then my second daughter, and then my son. And in those years, as my parents watched us raising our three young children, something changed. Last week, my mom commented how thankful she is to have gained another daughter in Jocelyn, and how she couldn’t ask for better parents for her grandchildren.
My parents aren’t going to be marching in any pride parades anytime soon. Yet, as they have seen what marriage equality means to us and the stability it provides their grandchildren, they have come around. Our lives have touched their hearts and helped them understand that our family is as deserving of love and respect as any other family.
Today, most people in our country support marriage equality. This year, attempts to urge the Supreme Court to overturn the Obergefell decision, issued 10 years ago this month, made headlines but ultimately failed — thanks in part to Republican opposition.
Some conservative lawmakers called it cruel to revoke a right couples and families now rely on. Others, despite personal objections, said it’s not their job to invalidate this freedom. In this age of extreme division, that is a victory. 
I want people to embrace the full humanity of LGBTQ+ people like me. Like my wife. I want them to see our family and how beautiful it all is. How we must protect equality and legal family security. I’ll never stop working toward that goal. At Family Equality, I work daily to protect LGBTQ+ families and our children in Vermont and nationwide.
Acceptance can be long, slow and complicated. I know this at the core of my being. I know this in my bones. But I’ve seen that living authentically can open hearts and minds. Love is raw and beautiful and uncomfortable and real.
Like marriage, love unites. And, ten years after Obergefell, I’ve come to see that love doesn’t just win — it transcends.

“I’m concerned that if we were to go as expansive as you’re suggesting that these schools, police stations, fire stations that would likely close in many communities because of lack of revenue,” said Supreme Court Justice Christopher Goff.
  Indiana Supreme Court Justice Christoper Goff asks a question during a hearing on June 24, 2024. (Screen shot from oral arguments)
But homeowners would save money if more acreage was classified under the 1% percent cap. It would also put an additional administrative burden on assessors to examine the use of property — rather than the one-acre limit in effect today.
Hoosier voters approved property tax limits in 2010 capping bills at 1% of the property’s assessed value for homesteads; 2% for other residential property and farmland; 3% for business. Increases from separately approved referendums are outside those limits.
Plaintiffs in the case believe the corresponding state law limiting the 1% cap to your dwelling and one acre of land conflicts with the constitutional provision.
There were no estimates on how much land the case might impact. The median lot size in Indiana is 9,200 square feet while the average is closer to 13,000 square feet. An acre is 43,560 square feet.
Lawmakers recently passed a bill to reduce homeowner property taxes next year but income taxes could make up the difference.
The case at hand
Taxpayers in this case – Dr. Tulsi and Kamini Sawlani — have 3.9 acres of land. The Lake County Assessor has limited the 1% cap to one acre, leaving the remaining 2.9 under 2% cap. Their attorney said this costs them about $ 1,000 annually.
Gerold Stout, arguing on behalf of the Sawlani’s, said most Hoosiers assumed when voting for the tax caps that their entire property would count as their homestead regardless of size.
The Indiana Tax Court found the one-acre limitation unconstitutional because it conflicts with the constitutional language that includes “curtilage” as part of a principal place of residence.
  Chief Justice Loretta Rush highlighted court accomplishments with lawmakers during the annual 2023 State of the Judiciary. (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)
By definition, a curtilage is the area of land attached to a house — typically including the yard, garden, and outbuildings, and considered legally part of the dwelling. But state law doesn’t define it.
Instead, lawmakers used the one-acre limitation, which Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush noted dates back to 1979.
She and other justices noted that the Tax Court decision makes it a case-by-case decision by assessors in 92 counties, meaning it could apply differently from community to community even though there is also a constitutional mandate for a uniform and equal property tax system.
Rush asked Stout to define curtilage, which he could not. He instead said it depends on how a homeowner is using the land.
“How many times did you play volleyball? What if you didn’t mow it?” Rush asked. “It seems a little happenstance.”
Stout conceded assessors would have to talk to homeowners to decide how they use it.
Defending the law
That’s why lawyers for the Lake County Assessor and the Attorney General’s Office argued the tax court decision should be reversed.
Ayn Engle, representing Lake County, said lawmakers were well within their exclusive authority to define curtilage at one acre.
“The tax court usurped the legislatures’ broad authority … and acted more as a legislative body than a judicial branch.” she said.
While Engle conceded the court could narrowly rule against the specific homeowners in the case because they didn’t provide evidence supporting their curtilage claim, she encouraged the court to decide the merits of the one-acre limitation.

“I think if assessors are required to look at more than one acre, you’re going to have assessors doing things differently across counties,” Engle said.
She said waiting would just kick the can down the road a year or two and assessors need clear rules now.
“I’ve been a judge a long time. That’s just the way it works. People come coming, people keep bringing cases,” Goff said.
Deputy Solicitor General Jenna Lorence conceded there “might” be specific circumstances in which the one-acre limitation could be found unconstitutional, but said that is for another day.
Justice Mark Mass said, “I’m a little confused. As I understand you are tasked with defending the constitutionality of state statutes. And here, today, you’re suggesting that this statute could be unconstitutional as applied … You seem to be arguing both sides of this.”
Several groups have filed briefs in the case and also participated in the arguments, including the Association of Indiana Counties and the Indiana Association of Realtors.

(Photo: Alejandra Rubio for Nevada Current)Legislation expanding protections for reproductive health providers, offering support around breastfeeding, and requiring schools to release data when law enforcement use force against students are among the bills taking effect July 1.
There are 191 bills slated to take effect next month, with a significant portion making appropriations to various state departments and agencies.
Among the list of laws going into effect is Assembly Bill 266, which prohibits people who are breastfeeding from being denied access to public accommodations.
The legislation also requires Nevada Department of Health and Human Services to provide online resources around breastfeeding, including information about Medicaid coverage for counseling and lactation support.
Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, the bill’s sponsor, told her colleagues in May that there are enough challenges to breastfeeding. Lacking protections to breastfeed in public or information about available community resources shouldn’t be another barrier, she said.
An original version of the bill sought to make denying accommodations to people breastfeeding a misdemeanor but that provision was removed.
The bill received strong support in both chambers, six Republicans – Assemblymembers Jill Dickman, Lisa Cole, Rich Delong and state Sens. Carrie Ann Buck, Robin Titus John Ellison – voted against the bill.
“This bill is important because it acknowledges the struggles that many new mothers face and it aims to provide the support they need to succeed in their breastfeeding journeys,” González said during the hearing in May. “By increasing access to resources to lactation consultants, peer support and workplace accommodations, we can ensure that no mother feels alone or unsupported during one of the most challenging and rewarding times.”
 Protections for medical providers

Since the overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022, reproductive health workers have seen “increased violence and harassment,” including stalking and death threats, Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth of Reno said in a May hearing.
Assembly Bill 235 would ensure employees and volunteers of reproductive health care facilities would be better protected. 
The bill, sponsored by Roth, allows those who work or volunteer in reproductive care the ability to request a court order that keeps their personal information confidential on otherwise public records within the offices of county recorder, county assessor, county clerk, city clerk, Secretary of State, or Department of Motor Vehicles. Their spouses, domestic partners or minor children could also request a court order.
Alexis Solis, the interim director of Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, told lawmakers in May that the political environment in the last few years has become more divisive, hostile, “and in some cases for our staff, dangerous.”
“Providers and Planned Parenthood staff in Nevada have been targeted with religious mail, have had anti-abortion propaganda physically dropped off at their homes, have received numerous threatening phone calls and have experienced numerous threatening incidents in Planned Parenthood health centers in Las Vegas,” Solis told lawmakers.
The legislation passed the Assembly 33-9 with bipartisan support. In the upper chamber, only Republican state Sen. Lori Rogich joined Democrats in support.
 FAFSA for incarcerated

Assembly Bill 153 offers assistance to people incarcerated within the Nevada Department of Corrections in completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to potentially receive aid, such as pell grants, to pay for prison education programs.   
People leaving prisons who are able to find meaningful employment are less likely to recidivate, said the bill’s sponsor, Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller. 
“By equipping individuals with knowledge and skills, educational programs within the correctional facilities can significantly improve their prospects upon release,” she said.
AB 153 passed out of both chambers nearly unanimously. Only Republican state Sens. Robin Titus and Lisa Kranser voted against the bill.
 Other bills going into effect


Assembly Bill 420, also by González, requires school districts in Clark and Washoe counties to report data on use of force against students and when police officers use pepper spray or tasers. The first annual report is due before the first day of the 2026-27 academic year and will cover the 2025-26 school year, which begins in August.
Senate Bill 348, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Julie Pazina, increases the fee hospitals pay the Nevada State Public Health Lab for newborn screenings. The additional funds will be used to expand the number of rare but treatable conditions newborns in Nevada are screened for. The prior rate had been the same for more than a decade and kept Nevada behind what the federal government recommends for newborn screening.
Senate Bill 116, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Skip Daly, establishes a formula to authorize the pay raises for the elected county positions such as district attorney, sheriff, county clerk, county assessor, county recorder, county treasurer and public administrator. The formula keeps those public servants’ pay above the highest paid person in their office.

So, it was a delight recently to hear Gov. Mike Braun and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith speak to high school FFA students from around the state.
There was no red meat or careful wording. The speeches, instead, were uplifting and full of kindness.
Beckwith kicked it off with a quick but effective address. At town halls, the controversial lieutenant governor can be combative. But this talk was positive and inspiring.
“You know, as I stand here, I’m reminded about the things that make Indiana an amazing state, one of the best states in the union, by far, because of integrity, hard work, dedication and excellence. I think there is not a better group of students that embody that than FFA members and students,” he said.
Beckwith recalled growing up in the world of agriculture with his father as president of the Michigan Dairy Association.
He encouraged the students to think beyond themselves.
“What are you leaving? What are you giving back? What are you doing to serve your fellow man, your community, your friends, your family and those that will come after you?” Beckwith asked.
He said the best leaders in his life were the ones who would sacrifice themselves to uplift others.
“That is the mark of a true leader … And those are the people that everybody wants to be around.”

Beckwith also encouraged the young Hoosiers to have empathy and be sensitive to what others are going through on life.
“You need to be walking with them, doing life with them, you know, linking arms with them. And if you do that, you’re going to be somebody that for years to come, will be very successful. No matter where your steps take you, you will be successful in everything you do.”
Braun started his speech by talking about his time in the U.S. Senate and then told the teens that he gets up early each day — without using an alarm clock — to pack as much into his day as he can.
He said most people know him as running a successful automative business, but one of the most enjoyable times of his life was as a farmer. And he stressed how important it was for he and his wife to return to their hometown of Jasper.
“You’re going to have a lot of forks in the road, and the more you get involved in what you like, it’s gonna prepare you for whatever you choose to do,” Braun said.
“You never know where life is going to take you. All I can tell you, is you’re showing right here that you’re going to be a mover and a shaker. You’re probably in the arena that I’ve enjoyed most, being a tree farmer and involved in the row crop side of it, having that turkey farm. If you get up each day, you view it with opportunity. You work hard. You never know where life might take you. Someday, you might even decide to get into public service.”
The governor ended by telling the students not to afraid of challenges.
“Always be willing to stick your neck out and take a little risk, otherwise, you’ll get down the trail and maybe be disappointed that you didn’t do more.”
I know these aren’t the kind of speeches that elected officials can give every day. They have to focus intently sometimes on budgeting, taxes and policy. But for one day it was a fond departure. And I hope the kids enjoyed it as much as I did.

But earlier this month, the Trump administration threw this process into flux when it overhauled guidance on how states nationwide should select applicants for the more than $42 billion in funding. The move effectively nullifies hundreds of applications already received, and sets Washington and other states on a tight timeline to figure out who should get money. 
“Two years of working on it and all of a sudden we’re supposed to switch on a dime or less, on a pinhead,” said state Rep. Cindy Ryu, a Democrat from Shoreline who chairs the House Technology, Economic Development and Veterans Committee.
Perhaps the biggest change to the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment, or BEAD, program concerns what technology will be prioritized. 
The program originally favored expanding fiber-optic cables, but the new rules require a “technology neutral” stance because “the full force of the competitive marketplace must be utilized,” according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
This agnostic approach creates room for satellite, fixed wireless and other technologies, which has the potential to send billions more to Elon Musk’s Redmond-based Starlink internet service. Musk served previously as a top adviser to President Donald Trump and spent upward of $200 million to help get Trump elected last year.
The BEAD program was created under the federal infrastructure law that former President Joe Biden signed in 2021. It was fashioned as a way to expand high-speed internet service into rural areas and other parts of the country where it was unavailable or lacking.
In Washington, local applicants looking to get some of that money include private companies, public utilities, tribes, nonprofits, local governments and more. The state has said it will offer $300 million in matching funds for local governments and tribes.
This year, Washington’s broadband office received hundreds of applications from across the state, and provisionally awarded money to some applicants. 
Other states were further behind than Washington, and now face application rounds as short as four days to meet new deadlines set by the Trump administration, said Aaron Wheeler, director of the Washington State Broadband Office, in a webinar last week.
“We were coming to the end, so we’ve got kind of a few of these things in place, but it does mean that there were some things that needed to be adjusted on the fly,” Wheeler said.
Washington expects to open up the next round of applications in early July. States have until early September to submit final plans on how to spend their portions to the federal government. The feds say they’ll review those plans within 90 days. 
The guidelines from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration aim to streamline the process, reduce costs, speed up deployment and increase marketplace competition, according to the agency. They eliminate a mandate to analyze climate resilience, and provisions related to open access, low-cost service plans and labor requirements.
State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen noted that Musk’s Starlink is a Washington-based company.
“Over 60% of the satellites currently in orbit are made right here in our state,” he said.
“As the federal guidelines evolve to allow more alternative technologies, we will continue to work closely with partners across the state to make sure we do not miss this generational opportunity to deliver broadband access to every community,” Nguyen added.
An applicant’s perspective
The Kitsap Public Utility District remains laser-focused on fiber-optic cable as the solution to poor internet access. 
Experts see wired service as the gold standard for fast, reliable internet. 
Claire Ward, a telecom strategist at the Kitsap County utility, fears it’ll now be a “race to the bottom” for other applicants seeking cheaper options to expand access. To her, while there is room for satellite and fixed wireless as solutions, they would serve more as band-aids than long-term fixes.
On Wednesday, two members of Washington’s congressional delegation, Sen. Maria Cantwell and Rep. Suzan DelBene, made that point to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
“We made the decision to invest larger sums now in broadband infrastructure that would be resilient and capable of meeting Americans’ growing digital demands for decades,” reads the letter they signed alongside dozens of lawmakers.
Ward hopes Washington will still lean into fiber under a provision in the original bipartisan infrastructure law that says “priority broadband projects” funded under BEAD must be designed “designed to provide broadband service that meets speed, latency, reliability, consistency in quality of service, and related criteria” that can be scaled to meet evolving technology needs. 
Only fiber could meet that requirement, Ward and others say.
The moving goalposts have left Ward feeling tired. She’s worried applicants who now need to reapply for funding will run out of resources and give up on the program. 
“I hope that they will be able to dig in their heels,” she said.
She doesn’t want to see the broadband program fall the way of the federal Rural Digital Opportunity Fund started under the first Trump administration, which has seen many providers default and rural areas left without any improved service.
In six months, Ward thinks, the state will know how well BEAD will serve Washington.
In the background
Broadband officials are also grappling with an unpopular provision tucked into the massive tax cut and spending bill Republicans are considering in Congress. 
The sweeping legislation, now in the Senate, would impose a 10-year ban on state regulation of artificial intelligence. If states don’t follow the prohibition on enforcing new or existing laws, the federal government would rescind the federal broadband funding. 
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown has said the ban would jeopardize the state’s laws on deepfakes in political advertising and fabricated sexual images known as “revenge porn.” Dozens of attorneys general from Republican- and Democratic-led states oppose the measure, arguing they can’t rely on Congress to adequately regulate artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, at this tumultuous moment, Wheeler, the director of Washington’s broadband office, is stepping down Friday. Wheeler, who was appointed in March 2024, is taking a job with the Suquamish Tribe. The state Department of Commerce, which houses the broadband office, expects to name an interim director while recruiting for a permanent leader.
“That person’s preferences of technology are going to have a big impact on how the Washington state BEAD program plays out,” Ward said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/laptop-internet-broadband-computer.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Balloons, unicorn headbands and crayons adorned the inside of the Michigan Hall of Justice, where the state supreme court meets, as members of the judicial system and child welfare system joined reunified families to celebrate the work it takes to restore families.
Through coordination between courts and child welfare professionals, parents who are struggling and need support in order to reunify with their children are given opportunities in family courts to be met with opportunity, not punishment, Cavanagh said. 
“It is not an easy journey for these parents or their children, but their resilience and strength in staying the course makes it all the more worthwhile when they get to live together as a family. At the center of all of it is love,” Cavanagh said. “Love is what brings families back together against all odds. Love is what makes Reunification Day possible, and love is what puts the smile on these faces and the tears in our eyes.”

In order to promote healing in the state, the child welfare system in Michigan needs to continuously ask hard questions on how things can be improved to best serve communities, Demetrius Starling, senior deputy director of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ Children’s Services Administration said. 
But at the heart of child welfare, Starling said the goal is to make Michigan a state that not only protects children, but restores families.
Separating children from their parents for the family’s welfare can be a traumatic experience for everyone involved, and is not a decision made lightly, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Lisa McCormick said. As the judge that presides over the county’s family division, McCormick thanked the child welfare professionals, foster parents and family relatives in the room that have stood with parents as they navigate reunification.
Reunified families who received support in family court in Ingham County joined in sharing their stories of how the services they received during the reunification process changed their lives.

Jamie Hodge told the crowd she still remembers forcing a smile and waving at her children so they would be less scared while child protective services took them away.
“When I became a mother, I experienced a kind of love like nothing I’d ever felt before, a kind of love that made me want to be the best mom I could possibly be. I would have never believed then that I would ever struggle with homelessness, addiction and my children being removed,” Hodge said.
Nothing in her life has been more heart-wrenching than watching her kids be taken away, Hodge said, and the experience left her bedridden for days. She said the only thing that motivated her to continue was the hope of reunification.
Family recovery court in Ingham County was a guiding light to recovery, Hodge said. It provided support and guidance on how to navigate getting her children back.

While working towards reunification, Hodge said the resources the court provided helped her get into treatment for addiction, gain employment and rent a house.
“I had a judge who believed in me and who helped me learn to advocate for myself and never gave up on me. I had a village. I was able to take such a hard time and turn it into an opportunity,” Hodge said, joined by her children at the event Thursday.

Jackson Public Schools will take them. 
The district, in partnership with Women for Progress of Mississippi, is hosting its annual “Stuff the Bus” event, where people can drop off much-needed classroom supplies for JPS teachers. 
Volunteers are taking donations from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday at the Interstate-55 Kroger and the Walmart near Mississippi Highway 18. Buses are stationed at both sites to collect supplies. 
Items in high demand include dry-erase markers, scissors, staplers, hole punchers, pencils, pens, crayons, notebooks, tissue and paper of all kinds. In lieu of supplies, the district is also accepting gift cards to be used for classroom needs.
“We are incredibly grateful to our lead sponsors and all community members who step up each year to support our teachers,” said Thea Faulkner, director of the district’s Partners in Education program that focuses on connecting the community to the schools, in a statement. “Your generosity makes a real difference in our classrooms.”
The donations might be especially important this year. Schools across the country and state are preparing for the upcoming school year with a tighter purse than usual, thanks to the Trump administration’s decision to freeze some federal funds.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)While utility consumers grapple with skyrocketing costs, lawmakers say they are looking for ways to keep electricity affordable and demand accountability from power companies. 
Led by Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Somerset), a group of bipartisan lawmakers announced a package of six bills intended to modernize New Jersey’s electric grid and keep rates stable. The state has previously relied on utility companies to upgrade the grid, but things haven’t moved fast enough — leaving it to the Legislature to act, Zwicker told reporters Thursday at the Statehouse in Trenton.
“Our transmission lines, as I’m sure some of you have heard, are unprepared to deal with the skyrocketing demand for energy. New innovations, such as electric cars, appliances, AI-based technology, all require massive amounts of electricity,” Zwicker said. “We are right now plugging 21st-century technology into a 20th-century energy grid, and the problems continue to mount.”
Democrats have blamed PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization that oversees and controls the electric grid for 12 states, including New Jersey, for the spike in electric bills seen starting this month. They have called for an investigation of the company’s capacity market auction, a price-setting auction that saw a nearly tenfold increase over the previous sale last July.
“If you’re hearing, as you drive through New Jersey, blood-curdling screams, they’re real, and they’re from the citizens of the state,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex). “People are going to be unbelievably angry, and they should be unbelievably angry.” 
Some of the bills in the package announced Thursday would: 

Require artificial intelligence data centers and crypto mining facilities to submit an energy plan to the Board of Public Utilities and mandate certain renewable energy for AI and crypto newly coming to New Jersey. 
Establish a program to “facilitate the development of energy-related projects.”
Create a new incentive program to redevelop decommissioned power plant sites into fusion energy hubs. 

Lawmakers said three other bills would be filed Thursday.
Smith stressed that New Jersey has to work in conjunction with the 13 states and the District of Columbia that PJM also oversees. Even if New Jersey rejected data center plans here, he noted, they could still be built in places like Virginia using the same electric grid New Jersey relies on. 
He suggested that without major reforms at PJM, New Jersey should considering working with another regional transmission organization. These organizations are supposed to keep power costs as low as possible, “and clearly, that’s not working with PJM anymore,” Smith added.  
Smith said New Jersey could absolutely remain with PJM, but “they know they have a problem.” 
“It’s unfair, inherently unfair to everybody out there in New Jersey. So I think putting that out there — let’s investigate,” he said. “Could we have a better deal someplace else? Should we do it ourselves? It’s smart for New Jersey to do it.”
New Jersey Republicans have blamed Democrats and Gov. Phil Murphy’s energy policies for the price hike, criticizing Murphy’s focus on offshore wind projects that have yet to materialize and have been blocked by the Trump administration.
Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) said New Jersey is “being held hostage,” echoing other Democrats who have claimed PJM is keeping prices high by refusing to connect various renewable energy sources to its grid.
“Bottom line is very simple — Legislature has to concentrate on what we can do and be effective. Modernizing the grid is real. It should happen,” he said. “We shouldn’t have to tell the utilities to do it. We should not have to direct the BPU to do it.” 
PJM has previously blamed the current price spike on a divergence between supply and demand.
“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” Dan Lockwood, a spokesperson for PJM, told the New Jersey Monitor earlier this month.

Regardless, a report issued Thursday by the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan estimated that the proposed cuts would result in at least 200,000 state residents no longer having health care coverage either through directly losing access to their plan, or by service providers that rely heavily on Medicaid funding to operate going belly up.
The report noted that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to approximately a quarter of Michigan’s more than ten million residents and has taken on a larger role over the past two decades, mainly due to enrollment spikes from economic downturns following the 2009 Great Recession and 2020 COVID pandemic, as well as the 2014 expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to certain low-income, non-disabled adults. Michigan was one of 40 states that exercised that option.
“We want to help establish the public understanding of how Medicaid works,” Eric Lupher, the council’s president, said. “Medicaid has such a large impact on the state, both as a share of the state budget and in terms of how many people have health insurance through the program. This paper gives people the information they need to understand the debate and prepare for what might happen if the legislation is enacted.”
The council’s report, which was issued prior to the parliamentarian’s ruling that the GOP proposal violated the Senate’s rules, was based on the original numbers. It says if substantial cuts are made to Medicaid as currently being proposed in the “big, beautiful bill”, Michigan stands to lose at least $2 billion per year in Medicaid revenue, and as much as $4 billion, resulting in policymakers having to decide between drastically cutting back the program, making reductions elsewhere in the state budget, or finding new revenue sources to make up the shortfall, “none of which are attractive options.”
Memo1180-Federal_Medicaid_Cuts_Will_Have_Big_Consequences_in_Michigan
Additionally, the proposed Medicaid cuts would likely have a negative outcome on local hospitals, particularly in rural areas. 
“If Medicaid spending is reduced substantially, some rural providers are likely to become unviable, which will not only impact those losing Medicaid coverage but also affect people living in those areas who have secure, private coverage,” the report stated.
The GOP bill is intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts made during President Donald Trump’s first term, as well as make spending reductions in an effort to vastly shrink the size of the federal government.
A report released in May by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services estimated as many as 700,000 Michiganders could lose coverage if the Medicaid cuts were to win approval, with calculations indicating that upwards of 40% of them would be dropped due to the implementation of work requirements.
The research council’s report concurred in that overall assessment, saying that while the precise estimates vary, expanded work requirements will result in significantly less people being eligible for Medicaid coverage. However, it said that would mostly be due to the “administrative burden” of fulfilling the requirements, not necessarily because the recipients did not truly have a need for assistance.
“Differing opinions exist as to whether the people who will be unenrolled due to work requirements should receive benefits from the program, but the fact that the requirements will decrease enrollment is intentional,” the report stated.
The council said one goal of the report was to provide insight into the complexity of the federal-state Medicaid partnership in delivering health care coverage while also supporting the state’s health care system.
“As a matter of policy, Medicaid is relatively complicated, so it is not always easy to understand how a change in the law might impact the actual delivery of health care on the ground,” Karley Abramson, the research council’s associate for health policy said. “If you are not familiar with how Medicaid eligibility and funding work, you would not necessarily realize how dramatically the proposed legislation could impact people and health care providers in the state.”

(Getty Images)Indiana’s cigarette tax is set to increase for the first time in nearly two decades, following a late April legislative scramble for additional revenue.
Separately, a gasoline excise tax will continue its annual one-cent climb. The changes take effect July 1, with the beginning of the state fiscal year.
The price of a pack of cigarettes is expected to average $11 after the tax jumps from $1 to $3, per the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. Other tobacco and nicotine products will also get pricier.
“We really are pleased that the Legislature and Gov. (Mike) Braun moved forward and approved an increase in these tobacco taxes,” said Mike Seilback, who is the national assistant vice president for state public policy at the American Lung Association.

Want to ditch nicotine? Call Indiana’s hotline at 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) or visit QuitNowIndiana.com.

He called the hike — the first since 2007 — a “win-win-win.”
Rising prices can discourage people from using the products and developing nicotine additions, but current users may also seize on the sticker shock as a reason to try quitting. And those who don’t stop will fill the state’s coffers.
“Most tobacco users want to quit, but nicotine is highly addictive — the average tobacco user tries to quit, you know, seven times before they’re successful,” Seilback said. “By increasing this tax, we expect many Hoosiers to take the opportunity to make another quit attempt and be successful.”
The American Lung Association estimates that 38,000 adult Indiana smokers will successfully quit in response to the tax boost.
The health and other impacts could start hitting within a year.

“It usually starts with less heart attacks,” Seilback said, as well as fewer secondhand smoke-induced asthma attacks. Lung cancer takes longer to develop, but he also anticipated seeing sales flag and quit line calls rise.
That’s a boon for the chamber, which has been pushing an increase for nearly 15 years.
“This is a workforce issue … A healthy state and healthy Hoosiers is good for business,” President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders said.
She cited a 2020 fact sheet from Indiana’s Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission that found workers who smoke each cost their employers an estimated $5,800 more in health care and lost productivity annually than non-smoking workers. Collectively, smoking costs Indiana upwards of $6 billion annually in health care and lost productivity.
A lower smoking rate, Sinders said, improves employee wellness, lowers health care costs and cuts absenteeism.
Change takes effect the sooner people are aware of the tax increases, according to Seilback. Quit line advertising can help.
That’s why the Chamber’s Wellness Council of Indiana on Thursday released an updated version of its Quit Now Tool.
“It’s a much-strengthened playbook designed to help employers act on this unique moment,” Ashley O’Rourke, the council’s executive director, said in a news release.

The web-based platform offers ready-to-use modules and printable course completion certificates. It’s now easier for managers to invite employees online and see their progress. The tool also added accessibility features.
“We feel like this is an important opportunity for us, the Indiana Chamber, to be out there with resources for employers and Hoosiers who, again, see that … $2-a-pack increase, and want to take that next step,” Sinders said.
Seilback warned that the General Assembly’s job isn’t done yet.
He noted the recent proliferation of nicotine pouches and heated tobacco products, particularly among younger Hoosiers.
“This is an industry that survives on addicting their next generation of customers,” Seilback said. “So, unfortunately, the industry is always coming up with new products that aren’t covered by current policies.”
“That’s why it’s so important that the Legislature continues … to make sure that (new products) are taxed appropriately,” he added. “Because we’re not going to achieve the gains we need to, from a public health perspective, if (people) are just switching. We want to make sure that they never start and that current users quit.”
Another increase
Transportation infrastructure will also get a boost after Indiana’s gasoline excise tax hops another penny higher. It’s indexed to inflation, but the annual increase is statutorily capped to a cent.
It will now add 36 cents to the price of every gallon of gasoline.
Sinders said the tax funds roads — and more — that are “really important to the state, to our future economic prosperity.”
The chamber, as the state’s largest broad-based business advocacy organization, has members who like and dislike the increase.
But, Sinders said, “all business cares about infrastructure and wants to make sure that our roads are … funded in a way that kind of sets us up for success, and sets these businesses up for success.”
The gasoline sales tax, which is updated monthly, will increase July 1, too. It’s up by about a cent, and will cost 17 and a half cents per gallon.
Federal gas taxes add 18.4 cents per gallon and there is also an oil inspection fee of one cent.
That brings the total of state and federal taxes per gallon to 72.9 cents.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Schools nationwide, including across Oklahoma, are still waiting for federal funds supporting English learners and migrant students while the Trump administration seeks to eliminate both programs.
As schools prepare their annual budgets for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins Tuesday, the Oklahoma State Department of Education reported this week it hasn’t yet received money from the federal government for migrant education and English language acquisition, along with a few other funds typically awarded annually to all 50 states.
The U.S. Department of Education, under Trump Cabinet Secretary Linda McMahon, has suggested eliminating the $375.6 million fund designated for children of migrant workers who travel from state to state within the school year and the $890 million for students learning English as their non-native language. McMahon’s budget proposal also suggests sweeping changes to other funding initiatives. 
The federal agency is yet to disclose a funding estimate for English learners, migrant education and Title II teacher-development programs for the 2025 fiscal year, which for the federal government ends Sept. 30. Education advocacy groups say the delay is cause for alarm and hinders districts’ ability to prepare for the coming school year.

Oklahoma received $6.43 million from the federal government for English language acquisition and $240,000 for migrant education in the 2024 fiscal year. About 13% of Oklahoma’s 700,000 public-school students are English learners, according to state records. The most recent national data available counted 79 migrant children in Oklahoma and 267,643 across the country.
The federal Department of Education has said it’s still finalizing funding decisions for FY 2025 and “remains committed to meeting its statutory responsibilities and stewarding taxpayer resources responsibly.”
Oklahoma state Superintendent Ryan Walters said he intends to “implement President (Donald) Trump’s America First reset” in public school classrooms, but he noted the U.S. Department of Education, not the state, controls federal allocations to schools.
“Our guidance to districts is to only budget for allocations (the U.S. Department of Education) has already rewarded,” Walters said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice.
In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal, the Trump administration specifically recommended eliminating funding for migrant education, also known as Title I Part C, because it “encourages ineligible non-citizens to access taxpayer dollars stripping resources from American students.”
“Elimination of this program is part of the administration’s overall effort to restore fiscal discipline and reduce the federal role in education,” the proposal reads.

Walters similarly has referred to immigrant students as a “taxpayer burden” crippling schools. He proposed a now-defeated policy to require public-school families to verify their citizenship status during school enrollment.
The federal agency said it isn’t requesting funds for English learner programs, either, because “states and localities, not the federal government, are best suited to determine what evidence-based literacy instructional materials will improve outcomes for all students.”
That connects with the Trump administration’s larger goal of turning over broad control of federal education dollars to the states. 
If Trump succeeds, it could be more challenging to maintain the same level of financial support for English learner programs in states like Oklahoma where political leaders espouse rhetoric similar to Walters’, said Jeff Hutcheson, director of advocacy and public policy for TESOL International Association.
“I am concerned that, especially in some states, there may be some steps backward in the service and support of English learners,” Hutcheson said.
TESOL stands for teaching English to speakers of other languages, and the federal government has been an invaluable source of professional development and support for teachers who work with this student group, Hutcheson said. The U.S. Department of Education also holds states and schools accountable for upholding English learners’ civil rights.

Not all 5 million English learners attending U.S. public schools are immigrants, Hutcheson said, but this group does have some overlap with migrant children, whose federal funding also is in doubt.
The migrant and English learner programs together provide about $218,000 to Frederick Public Schools, a district of 700 students in southwest Oklahoma. 
Superintendent Shannon Vanderburg said his district educates children of migrant laborers working on farms in the area.
The district already rehired employees who provide migrant and English learner services for the next school year. To lose federal support for either program would be a “big hit,” Vanderburg said.
The migrant education funds are flexible, he said, which allows Frederick schools to provide tutoring, summer and weekend reading academies, eye doctor and dentist visits for students, and GED programs for their parents.
Just under a quarter of Frederick students are learning English as their second language, state records show. The district received high marks on state report cards for these students’ progress toward English proficiency.
“The awful part of this is, you can see through our kids’ test scores that it’s working,” Vanderburg said. “What we’re doing is working and working well, and I just don’t want to lose that momentum with our kids.”
A letter from 82 advocacy organizations and education-focused groups, including the TESOL International Association, urged Congress not to cut English learner funding, also known as Title III. 
Instead, the letter’s cosigners, led by UnidosUS, encouraged federal lawmakers to increase Title III funding from $890 million to $1 billion to keep up with economic inflation and growth in the number of English learners. 
“Congress must not betray their commitment to English learner education, as our nation cannot afford the consequences of leaving these students behind,” the May 23 letter states.
The letter also criticized the U.S. Department of Education’s decision to abolish its Office of English Language Acquisition. A federal judge has since overruled the agency’s mass layoffs, but the matter is still tied up in court.
Future of rural education program in doubt
Other programs, though funded this year, could be eliminated in the future. 
Rather than doling out money into “numerous small, poorly designed programs,” the federal Education Department aims to consolidate funding into larger, more flexible block grants given to every state. These grants would grant individual states more control over how they spend their federal education funds, a measure Oklahoma state leaders welcomed.
Funds designated for rural schools, homeless children, gifted and talented programs, and school safety are among the many programs the Trump administration suggested for consolidation into state grants. 
That means the federal government would no longer require states to continue funding most of these initiatives, if state officials don’t wish it. 
The administrative work and auditing that come with federal dollars are “just burdensome,” said Jeff Thompson, superintendent of Sharon-Mutual Public Schools. 
The district of 220 students in northwest Oklahoma receives about $115,000 a year in federal funds, including about $20,000 from the Small, Rural School Achievement Program, which the U.S. Department of Education aims to end with consolidations in 2026.
“If they could find a way to get us the money and let local control take over, that would be the best way,” Thompson said.
However, these programs provide essential services that would be nigh impossible for many rural schools to replace. 
That’s the case in Sharon-Mutual schools, too, Thompson said. The district uses the money to pay for technology needs and its parent communication system.
The neighboring Mooreland Public Schools in northwest Oklahoma receives about $40,000 from the rural achievement program. 
Superintendent Theron Graybill said this money allows the district to provide an updated Chromebook to every student.
“It’s pretty vital for us in keeping us up-to-date on technology out here,” Graybill said.

Now, the U.S. Congress plans to extend a 2017 federal tax law that would hand even more benefits to the richest few, while hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians face the loss of health care and food assistance, as well as rising costs. 
North Carolina state leaders will soon have a choice: Will they accept the harm being forced on our communities and slash essential services? Or will they step up to protect people’s health, stability, and financial well-being?  
So far, signs point in the wrong direction.  
Some state lawmakers have introduced proposals this session which indicate the legislative majority will embrace plans that take health care away from North Carolinians. Legislators in both the House and Senate introduced proposals that fast-track Medicaid work reporting requirements — an unnecessary and punitive measure that could strip health care from up to an estimated 496,000 people as soon as federal law allows. These proposals push the state’s Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to begin planning for the implementation of Medicaid work reporting requirements on an expedited timeline, requiring DHHS to notify the legislature of the funding necessary for implementation within 30 days of approval by the Center for Medicaid Services.  
But there is another path, and we must demand that state legislative leaders choose it for the health and wellbeing of us all.  
Our state legislators should be unwilling to accept a future in which more North Carolinians are uninsured, sick, and hungry. They must recognize that when federal leaders walk away from their responsibilities, the consequences fall on states like North Carolina. And state lawmakers have the tools to respond.
Here’s one simple step for them to take: They can establish a higher income tax rate on incomes over $1 million.
A millionaire’s tax at 7 percent on incomes over $1 million — a rate still lower than the highest rates pre-2013 — would provide more than $980 million in additional revenue every year. That revenue could protect North Carolinians from harmful federal cuts.   
Right now, North Carolina uses a flat income tax rate — the same rate for someone living in poverty and a millionaire. The flat income tax rate means the richest would receive the biggest windfall from any future tax cuts.   
In contrast, adopting a higher rate on higher incomes wouldn’t impact the rate paid by the vast majority of North Carolinians, and even millionaires would still pay the lower rate on their first $1 million in annual income. That’s how graduated income tax rate schedules work to ensure fairness and adequacy — necessary functions of a tax code that provides funding for the health care, child care, housing, and education that delivers better outcomes for people and a stronger economy. 
As congressional leaders push for more federal tax breaks for the rich — shifting the costs of essential programs onto states — everyday North Carolinians will be expected to pick up the slack. Estimates of the tax break from the U.S. House package find that the richest 1 percent of North Carolinians, whose annual income averages about $1.9 million, would receive an average annual tax cut of nearly $65,000 (3.5 percent of their income), a disproportionately larger cut relative to that received by the worst-paid North Carolinians, who would receive a tax cut of just $80 (just 0.6 percent of their annual income).

Here in North Carolina, state Senate leaders have signaled where they stand. Rather than fight for the wellbeing of every North Carolinian and keep costs low for us all, they would continue to cut taxes for millionaires. In their budget proposal, the Senate leaders propose reducing the personal income tax rate to 1.99 percent as soon as 2031 if certain revenue triggers are met. To be clear, for more than a decade, millionaires have reaped significant benefits from state income tax cuts and, once again, they would reap the lion’s share of this next state income tax cut.
According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, this Senate proposal alone would deliver an additional average annual tax cut of $64,700 to millionaires in North Carolina, on top of their federal tax cuts and more than a decade of state cuts. This is more than 52 times the average amount received by non-millionaires, who would see roughly $1,200.

At a time when so much is at stake for our communities, it’s essential that leaders make sure the wealthy pay what they truly owe. State leaders can protect North Carolinians from the losses Congress is proposing by implementing a millionaire’s tax now.   
A budget that hands out more tax breaks to millionaires at a time when essential federal supports are being dismantled isn’t just short-sighted — it’s dangerous. 
North Carolina needs a better plan than what Senate leaders are offering us. When lawmakers choose people over profits, our state can build a future where everyone has the freedom and opportunity to thrive.

NEZ PERCE RESERVATION, IDAHO – Long before the American government removed them both from their ancestral homelands, wolves and Native Americans coexisted side-by-side for centuries.
Those connections run deep for Shannon Wheeler, the chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee.
Wheeler remembers growing up as a boy, hearing elder members of the Nez Perce Tribe tell stories about wolves.
One story involves a young boy talking with his grandfather.
“They were talking and the grandfather told him that each of us have a wolf inside of us.
We actually have two wolves inside of us. 
One’s a good wolf, and one’s a bad wolf.
And they’re constantly fighting one another. 
And the grandson asked him, ‘Well, Grandpa, which wolf wins?’ 
And he says, ‘Whichever one you feed the most will win,‘” Wheeler said.
The story of the two wolves is one that Wheeler carries with him to this day.
“We’re able to utilize that lesson and our teachings to our younger ones coming up as we continue to try to grow our people and to fit into part of a world that is outside of who we are and outside of our culture and so we need those strengths,” Wheeler said. “We need to know that we’re feeding the good wolf inside of us so that we are that strong.”

In addition to the stories, some members of the Nez Perce Tribe develop even deeper spiritual connections with wolves.
“What I can tell you from my position as the Tribal chairman is the wolf has always played a significant part in who we are as people, based on even the names of our people,” Wheeler said. “Many of our people have gone out for wéyekins … A wéyekin is something where you go and fast and you get your animal spirit, and it’ll come to you. And sometimes it’s a himíin, it’s a wolf. Himíin is the name for us for wolf.”
Nearly 70 years after the U.S. government drove the wolf population to near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, that spiritual connection is what led tribal members to work to bring the himíin back to Idaho, Yellowstone National Park and the West. This is the story of how the Nez Perce pulled off a task no one else wanted – and why they’re still fighting for wolves today.
 An opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land

For thousands of years the Nez Perce Tribe has lived, hunted, fished and traded in what are now parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Wyoming.
Over time, members of the Nez Perce Tribe developed a deep connection to the land and animals, said Allen Pinkham, a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who was born in 1938.
“To us, we are given the opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land that we’re at right now, and then we’re supposed to take care of the land and all the species that we utilize because it’s a life source,” Pinkham said. “It’s an opportunity to believe and have faith in your Creator. That’s what we do, and we’re supposed to take care of everything else, because it provides and sustains life for ourselves.”
Today, the Nez Perce is a federally recognized tribe that has about 3,500 members and governs the Nez Perce Reservation that is located in north-central Idaho.

The Tribe’s headquarters is located in the town of Lapwai, Idaho, and the reservation sits on a fraction of the Nez Perce’s ancestral territory. Lapwai is a working-class town nestled in a valley and the reservation is a mix of grassland, forested mountains and rural communities anchored by the Clearwater River.
An 1855 treaty between the Nez Perce Tribe and the U.S. government set aside about 7.5 million acres of land for the tribe.
But after gold was discovered on the reservation, additional treaties shrunk its size to less than a tenth of what it was. It’s now about 770,000 acres
 The Idaho Legislature wanted no part of the federal governments plan to reintroduce wolves to Idaho

Thanks to bounties, trapping and widespread poisoning, by the 1930s the U.S. federal government all but killed off wolves that used to roam the U.S. Rocky Mountains from the Canadian border to Mexico.
But in the 1990s the U.S. government undertook one of the most controversial wildlife programs in history – capturing wild wolves in Canada and reintroducing them in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.

On Jan. 14, 1995 – in the aftermath of a major snowstorm, Suzanne Asha Stone was part of a convoy of vehicles that made a white-knuckle drive across icy roads to release four wolves at Corn Creek at the edge of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Central Idaho. At the time, Stone was an intern on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s wolf capture and reintroduction team.
Conditions were so sketchy that some members of the team unbuckled their seatbelts as they worried about plunging into the freezing Salmon River below, Stone said.
“If you slid off the road into the river, you wouldn’t have had time to disconnect your seat belt,” Stone said. “It was kind of like the decision of what’s the worst that could happen, and preparing for that.”
The wolves, which had been flown from Canada, were placed in kennels and driven in the back of U.S. Forest Service pickups to the Frank Church Wilderness.
When they arrived at Corn Creek, the wolf team opened the kennel doors and immediately released the wolves into the wild.
Those first four wolves reintroduced in Idaho had only been running wild for three days when the Idaho Legislature nearly derailed the entire operation.
On Jan. 17, 1995, the Idaho Legislature rejected the Wolf Recovery and Management Plan developed by the Legislative Wolf Oversight Committee.
The move blocked the state from leading wolf recovery in Idaho.
And it left the federal government without a local partner to monitor and oversee the first wolf population to call Idaho home in more than half of a century.
What happened next is a largely untold story of how the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho.
Even now, 30 years later, many people in Idaho don’t know the role the Tribe played.
 ‘A song for the wolves:‘ How the Nez Perce Tribe saved wolves in Idaho

Even as the Idaho Legislature said no to wolves, the Nez Perce Tribe was demonstrating its connection to wolves and investment in wolf reintroduction.
Just before wolves were reintroduced to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in January 1995, the late Horace Axtell, who was the spiritual leader of the traditional Nez Perce Seven-Drum religion, and Tribal member Allen Pinkham traveled to Missoula, Montana.
Axtell and Pinkham came to offer blessings for the wolves that had been captured in Canada and were being kept in kennels at an airport hangar before their release. They met the wolves just before they were transported over the final leg of their journey for reintroduction.
During the ceremony, Axtell welcomed the wolves back home to Montana, Idaho and Yellowstone.
“And so he sang a song for the wolves,” Pinkham said.
About that time, the late Nez Perce leader Levi Holt traveled to Boise to meet with policymakers, said his nephew, James Holt.
Levi Holt delivered a speech at the Idaho State Capitol pushing to have the Nez Perce Tribe take responsibility for the new wolf program in Idaho, James Holt said.
“My uncle Levi, being very active at that time, made that impassioned speech before decision makers to actually push them to have the Tribe be the managing partner for that reintroduction effort,” James Holt said.
It worked.

Because of the Tribe’s connection to wolves and history of coexistence, the Nez Perce Tribe was ready to take over wolf reintroduction and conservation after the Idaho Legislature said no.
“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was looking for a partner, and we became that partner,” said Aaron Miles Sr., who has worked as natural resources manager for the Nez Perce Tribe since 1999.
Miles was still finishing his forestry degree at University of Idaho when the Nez Perce took over the program in Idaho. He took pride in seeing the Tribe taking a lead role in protecting a species that had shared a homeland with his ancestors.
But Miles also heard plenty of stereotypes and lots of misinformation about the Tribe – even among college students he was helping tutor.
“I’d hear all the chatter about, well, can the Tribe do this? How can they do that?” Miles said. “They’re all these questions, and sometimes it was racist. It wasn’t just the fact that they were asking an honest question. But it had to be like, ‘OK, these Indians, this or that,‘ and here I am helping some of these guys with their homework, and that really upset me.”
 Hiking and howling, the jaw-dropping work of monitoring Idaho’s new wolf population

Biologist Marcie Carter is a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who served on the Tribe‘s wolf project starting in June 1997.
Carter got her start while she was still a student at Lewis-Clark State College and helped put together the first wolf management plan.

“Our goal was to go into the field, find paired up wolves that potentially had pups, and document the reproduction of those wolves, and also count how many pups were out there,” Carter said.
“That summer I don’t even recall how many, we probably had maybe five or six pairs of wolves that had puppies that year,” Carter said. “So they started out very well.”
Carter and another biologist spent their summer hiking around Central Idaho in places like Stanley and the Bear Valley area near the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, looking for wolves.
The wolves had been fitted with radio collars that allowed the wolf project team to track their location.
Typically a pilot and another team member would fly overhead, locate the wolves from the air and then use a radio to relay the animals‘ location to the biologists on the ground.
At that point, the biologists would hike in and locate the wolves.
“We worked 10 days in a row, and then we’d take four days off,” Carter said. “And we camped out, we backpacked and lived in a tent and slept on our Therm-A-Rest and ate packaged noodles. And every day for those 10 days, that’s what we were doing. We were up, out and looking for any type of sign of wolves.”
Although she grew up in Idaho and had spent time in the woods, Carter hadn’t really ventured into the wilderness until she joined the Nez Perce‘s wolf project team.
Before setting out, she had to borrow a backpack, sleeping bag, tent and cook stove.
A typical assignment during her first summer in 1997 involved flying into Central Idaho’s remote Chamberlain Basin with a team of other biologists.
Located within the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the Chamberlain Basin was the site where one of the first wolf packs in Idaho established territory following the reintroduction of wolves. That pack became known as the Chamberlain Basin Pack.
“That was basically our lives during that time,” Carter said. “It was just backpacking, walking, hiking, listening. It was a great time.”
The reason they spent so much time in wolf country is because that is the best way to get an idea of how the wolves are doing and what they are up to.
Carter and the team conducted howl surveys. With hands cupped over mouths, researchers threw their heads back and let out their best imitation wolf howls.
They hoped to get live wolves to howl in response, which helped them track the wolves’ location.
As the team hiked and drove across wolf country, they scoured the ground for wolf tracks and droppings that researchers call scat.
They analyzed data from wolves fitted with radio collars.
They documented the newborn pups.
And they counted the wolves that were killed.
Once a year the team packed all that data into a report documenting Idaho‘s wolf population.
“It was all very positive and very, very jaw-dropping type work,” Carter said.
Although the wolf project started as a cool summer job for her, it became more than that.
Carter soon began asking one of her grandfathers about wolves.
They talked about how himíin, the Nimíipuu language word for wolf, comes from the word for mouth. That’s because wolves talk to each other, Carter said, with their howls.
When older members of the Nez Perce Tribe began to find out about the wolf project, they asked Carter about her work and shared stories about the Tribe’s history.
When they talked about losing wolves from the landscape, sometimes the older Nez Perce members talked to Carter about other losses the Tribe experienced.
“It was a learning experience for me, not just in the field, but culturally,” Carter said.
“It’s just that it goes back to the loss of the connection that all Tribal people went through, with being moved to the reservation, being forced to stop speaking our language,” Carter said.
“It did kind of raise that awareness – also for other Tribal people – that loss that we had experienced and continue to experience,” Carter said. “And then that reconnection – it happened with wolves. It’s happening with salmon. Maybe someday it’ll happen with grizzly bears.”
Over six years on the wolf project, Carter documented growth and stabilization in Idaho’s wolf population.
And as she observed wolves in their natural habitat, Carter saw a very different side to the animals that people warned her about.
“I saw these families of wolves taking care of each other and playing, and they are not this evil that people think,” Carter said.
 As the wolf population increased in Idaho, calls for change grew

During Carter’s time monitoring wolves, the population increased significantly.
Compared to the original 15 wolves released in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in 1995, the Nez Perce Tribe reported a minimum of 192 wolves in the central Idaho recovery area in the fall of 2000.
At the end of 2005 – a decade after wolves were reintroduced to Idaho – the Nez Perce team and Idaho Department of Fish and Game biologists had identified 59 resident wolf packs in Idaho.
Biologists observed a minimum of 370 wolves in 2005, and estimated the state’s wolf population to be 512 in 2005.
By 2005, wolf territory in Idaho stretched from near the Canadian border, south to Interstate 84 and east from the Oregon border to the Montana and Wyoming borders, the wolf team noted in its annual report.
During 2005, Wildlife Services officials said 26 cattle, 218 sheep and nine dogs were reported as “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills.
As the number of wolves and wolf kills increased, so did the calls to remove the wolf from the Endangered Species List and turn management of wolves over to the states.
Under the Endangered Species Act, animals that are listed in danger of extinction are given protections – like the protection of critical habitat and prohibitions on hunting – and recovery plans. For species protected by the Endangered Species Act, the animals’ recovery and stabilization is the priority.
Animal species that have been saved by Endangered Special Act protections include the bald eagle, the California condor, the whooping crane and grizzly bear, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Once species are removed from Endangered Species Act protections, regulations can be eased and states can approve hunting rules or other management and lethal population control methods.
In January 2006, then-Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Interior transferring day-to-day management of wolves to the state of Idaho.
After about a decade, the Nez Perce Tribes’ role leading wolf recovery in Idaho had come to an end.
“I think we would have kept it, but the funding was going away, and so we did not have the money to keep a program going,” Carter said. “And so I think the only way was basically to hand it over to the state.”
 Removing wolves from protections under the Endangered Species Act

By 2007, the state of Idaho was officially planning for its first wolf hunts since reintroduction in 1995. At that same time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife put forward plans to remove the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List.
A series of legal battles ensued, where wolves were removed and then returned to the Endangered Species List.
In January 2009, Samuel N. Penney, the then-chairman of Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee, wrote a letter expressing the Tribe‘s full support for removing wolves from Endangered Species Act protections in Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, northern Utah and eastern Washington.

Penney told then-Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar that wolves met recovery goals for the Northern Rocky Mountain region in 2002.
By 2008, Idaho’s wolf population was estimated at over 800 wolves in 88 packs, Penney wrote.
“The Tribe wants, and understands that citizens of United States also want, wolves to be conserved,” Penney wrote. “The Tribe is confident that you understand the importance we place on being able to make decisions locally about how to wisely manage this resource in combination with all our other wildlife resources.”
Ultimately, wolves were removed from Endangered Species Act protections in 2011 after Congress inserted language into the federal budget requiring the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove wolves in Idaho, Montana, eastern Washington, eastern Oregon and north-central Utah from the Endangered Species List.
By May 2011, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game had taken over management of wolves in Idaho, and put wolf hunting tags up for sale.
Then in 2021, the Idaho Legislature expanded wolf hunting and trapping by removing the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters can buy, allowing trapping on private land year round and allowing the state to enter into contracts with third parties to kill wolves.
The state of Idaho had officially set out to reduce the wolf population by killing the predators.
Now Marcie Carter and other wolf advocates worry the government is starting to go down the same road it did 100 years ago when wolves were eradicated from the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” Carter said.
“It’s definitely being undone,” Carter added. “It’s been being undone since we stepped out. It’s very expensive to recover wolves and it’s not very expensive to take them off the landscape.”
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis are also backing Trump’s decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. 
The post After criticizing ‘warmonger’ Liz Cheney, Hageman backs U.S. intervention in Iran appeared first on WyoFile .","More than two years ago, Wyoming welcomed then-former President Donald Trump for his first political visit to the state. At a rally in Casper, Trump urged voters to choose Harriet Hageman over Liz Cheney in the race for Wyoming’s lone seat in the U.S. House. Chief among the reasons Trump highlighted was Cheney’s interventionist stance. 
“The Cheneys have never met a war they didn’t like,” Trump said, referring to both the congresswoman and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who played a pivotal role in the U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
“Wyoming deserves a congresswoman who stands up for you and your values, not one who spends all of her time putting you down, going after your president in the most vicious way possible and loving endless, nonsensical, bloody, horrible wars that never end,” Trump said. “They just never end.”
Hageman, too, cast Cheney as a “warmonger” for her “interventionist ways” during the 2022 campaign, and promised voters she would be a different kind of congresswoman for Wyoming.
Now, in her second term, Hageman joins U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis in backing the Trump administration’s intervention in the Middle East. 
The three members of Wyoming’s federal delegation have made public comments supporting Trump’s decision on Saturday to bomb three Iranian nuclear facilities. 
While a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is reported to be holding, Trump has said the conflict is both “over” and that it could start again “soon.” There have also been conflicting reports about the extent to which the U.S. strikes destroyed Iranian nuclear sites. 
Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiry asking to what extent they would support additional U.S. intervention in the conflict. 
Background
Before her ousting, Cheney supported U.S. intervention in the war between Ukraine and Russia. 
“America cannot defend and maintain our own freedom and security if we think that we’re simply going to withdraw from the world and not lead,” Cheney told CBS in February 2022.

In response, Hageman condemned the Russian invasion to Cowboy State Daily but pushed back on Cheney’s stance. 
“It’s also alarming to see that Liz Cheney simply can’t resist falling back into her interventionist ways. In her remarks, she came awfully close to calling for American military intervention, which would be extraordinarily dangerous and something that I strongly oppose,” Hageman said. “We must do whatever we can to support the Ukrainians, but inserting American troops squarely into the conflict would be a horrible idea.”
Since then, Hageman has voted against Ukrainian aid while supporting assistance for Israel. 
More recently, Hageman said, “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”
Ahead of Saturday’s strikes, Barrasso gave an interview to Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is a former co-host of the weekend show. During his TV appearance, Barrasso defended Trump for “doing absolutely the right thing to keep America safe.”
“He has been very consistent for 10 years, saying Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. He said it strongly. He’s read it repeatedly, because he knows that Iran with a nuclear weapon is a threat to the people of the United States, and we stand with the people of Israel,” Barrasso said. 
After the Saturday strikes, the Wyoming senator reiterated his position on X. 
“The greatest threat to the safety of the United States and the world is Iran with a nuclear weapon,” Barrasso wrote in a post. 
As Senate Majority Whip and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Barrasso has advocated for increased defense spending.
“Republicans will rebuild our military, improve military readiness, expand shipbuilding, and invest in new technologies to keep America safe, including an Iron Dome for America,” Barrasso said on the Senate floor in March. “All of this makes our military more lethal. Americans strongly support these policies. They know that this is the path towards safety and security.”
In 2023, Barrasso split with Lummis over whether to repeal the resolutions that gave the executive branch permission to wage decades of war in the Middle East, according to the Jackson Hole News and Guide. 
Lummis supported the repeal, describing the resolution as a move away from the model of “forever wars.” Generally speaking, Lummis has held a
cautious stance regarding American military intervention, recently citing concerns over spending levels. 
In the case of Iran, Lummis supports Trump. 
“For years, Iran has openly chanted ‘death to America’ and has acted as the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism. Iran having nuclear weapons is a threat to our country and allies. President Trump was right to order this strike on their nuclear facilities,” Lummis posted on X. 
“May God continue to bless our troops.”

An Albany County tornado this month proved a harmless weather event. Unless, that is, you’re part of southeastern Wyoming’s passionate and growing mountain bike community. 
The post Laramie’s Windy Windy gets very windy appeared first on WyoFile .","Amid a dramatic summer storm that brought hail and thunderstorm warnings, a tornado touched down June 17 outside Laramie and was on the ground for around five minutes, according to Albany County Emergency Services. 
The tornado ran 1.6 miles and its maximum wind speed reached an estimated 105 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Its path cut through a section of U.S. National Forest land, and there were no injuries or damage to structures.
A harmless weather event. Unless, that is, you’re part of southeastern Wyoming’s passionate and growing mountain bike community. 
The tornado spent its brief time on Earth knocking down a dense swath of trees across a beloved and critical piece of the growing Pilot Hill trail network. 
That trail section’s name? Windy Windy. 
The title invokes two homonyms, Richard Vercoe, one of the volunteers who maintains the trail network, told WyoFile — it is windy, as in curving across the landscape, and also windy, as in buffeted by Wyoming’s steady blow. 
“It’s the only section of trail named after the wind, and that’s where the tornado hit,” Vercoe said.

Windy Windy is a stretch of the trail connecting the pathways of the Pilot Hill area, a grouping of public land owned by various government entities and managed to the benefit of recreationalists, with the sprawling forest service land that includes the Happy Jack trail network. It’s a principal thoroughfare for mountain bikers linking together trails for long rides, Vercoe said. 
Windy Windy climbs and descends gently as it carries cyclists between forest and wide-open, high-country views, according to Vercoe, earning it devotion from area riders both for the flow of its trail and its aesthetics. 
But when a long-distance rider reached Windy Windy the day after the funnel struck, he found downed trees layered on top of each other. 
Vercoe, who visited the site the next day, said the tornado left the downed trees in a pattern so circular it made him think of the otherworldly crop circles that puzzle farmers and intrigue UFO enthusiasts. He estimated the diameter of the circle at about 200-300 yards. 
According to NWS, the tornado’s path was 450 yards wide, with the heaviest damage occurring along the connector trail.

Vercoe belongs to a volunteer group called the Trail FAIRIES (short for Fast Acting Initial Response Indefatigable Environmental Stewards). Those stalwart cyclists, through arrangements with the agencies that own the public land and the nonprofit that stewards the Pilot Hill biking area, clear downed trees and other trail obstacles quickly. The idea is to keep the cycling community from having to wait on the timelines of government agencies.  
It was two U.S. Forest Service sawyers who first worked to restore Windy Windy, Vercoe said. They began their work the day the rider reported the damage. Using chainsaws, the government sawyers cleared as many as 60 downed trees that first day, Vercoe said. The following day, he and two other volunteers resumed the task and cleared a similar number. The following day, two more volunteers repeated the performance. All told, Vercoe said they might easily have had to saw through 200 downed trees to reopen a 6-foot wide swath of trail through the damage zone.
“You’re sawing trees at multiple heights — chest high, ground level, head high,” he said. Some trees had their tops snapped off 20 feet up, others were tossed entirely out of the earth, he said.

Four days after the storm, bikers were again passing along Windy Windy. 
The tornado hasn’t ruined the scenic stretch, Vercoe said, especially for those who call the area home. 
“As we ride through there you will see these crazy acts of physics, and then soon these really unique ecological processes,” he said. “Over the next 10 years, you’re going to get to watch a tornado ecological succession story. I think it added a whole new flavor to Windy Windy.”

NPR and PBS may suffer with Congressional funding cuts, but rural, red America will be most impacted, writes KHOL Executive Director Emily Cohen.
The post Public media is local journalism. Let’s get the facts straight about defunding it appeared first on WyoFile .","We’ve missed the mark about how we’re talking about Congress’ attempt to defund public media.

Opinion

Here’s what’s getting lost: Public radio and television stations are independent and community-owned. One-third of public radio stations are not NPR affiliates, and most aren’t located in big cities. In fact, the people who will be most hurt by these cuts live in rural, often conservative parts of the country — places like much of Wyoming, where news deserts have crept in, local journalism has dried up and public media is often the only newsroom left.
Federal dollars allocated by Congress to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are redistributed to 386 public radio stations via annual grants. To qualify for CPB funding, stations must show significant local support and investment. KHOL, the station I manage, didn’t qualify for a CPB grant until 2020, 12 years after we first went on the air. 
Once awarded a grant, those stations decide how to spend their money. The federal Communications Act — Congress’ own rules! — requires that 25% of these grants are spent on “national program acquisition or distribution.” Some stations chose to pay for NPR with these dollars, akin to how newspapers license wire stories from AP or Reuters. The intent is to supplement, not substitute. Unfortunately, the public often doesn’t realize this distinction — apparently, neither do many lawmakers — and local stations are suffering as a result. 
At KHOL in Jackson, the station I lead, we air some national shows like Marketplace and The Daily distributed by American Public Media and Left, Right and Center distributed via NPR, but we’re not an NPR affiliate. 
Like the 386 public radio stations supported by CPB grants, we’re independent. Our reporters live in the community we serve. Our daily newscast, feature stories and public affairs shows are for, and about, the people who live and work here. 
The role of public media
In an era when journalism is increasingly polarized, with clickbait and social media often driving ideological divides, public media remains a rare public good. It’s free, locally grounded and committed to facts and civic life.

As local newspapers have closed, people are turning to national news and “influencers” who view the world through whatever lens they choose. (This May, social media surpassed television as the most popular news source.) There’s a structural reason behind the polarization of the press: Straight news doesn’t really pay for itself anymore. 
Americans are pinned between paywalls at legacy outlets like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal and free content from The Daily Wire or Breitbart that have explicit political alignments.
That’s where public media comes in. It offers high-quality journalism that’s free, widely accessible and local. 
Let’s reframe the debate
This is a moment for public media to reclaim its community-centered identity, but first we need to do a better job talking about what we do and who we are. We are community newsrooms serving places the national press rarely reaches. We’re often the only journalists in town. We’re watchdogs, storytellers and public servants.
Defunding public media won’t fix bias in media. Instead, it will tear down the infrastructure that brings independent, free, local news to the places where it is most needed.

(Courtesy of Rhoades for Public Service Commission)OMAHA — The Democratic primary for the U.S. House seat in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District might soon get more crowded.
Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades told the Nebraska Examiner this week that she is “testing-the-waters” for possibly jumping into the race in the Omaha-based 2nd District now represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon. She said she could be interested whether Bacon stays in the race or retires. 
“It’s certainly not a secret that I’m considering it,” Rhoades said. 
People ask her to consider
She said “some folks” have been lobbying her to get in, and her campaign shared internal polling indicating her and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha within the margin of error for Democratic primary voters in NE-02. The polling has former political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell at what Rhoades called a “distant third.”
“John and I are starting from the same place,” Rhodes said. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh running for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd District

Earlier this month, Cavanaugh, the son of a former Democratic congressman from Omaha, formally announced his candidacy. Powell, the daughter of a leader in Spanish-language news, announced her bid in May. Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running.  
Republicans are waiting in the wings for Bacon’s decision, a list that local conservatives have said includes former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding and perhaps Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei. 
Background in politics
The lifetime Omahan was the last Democrat elected to a statewide position as a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all regulator for topics as varied as telecommunications and pipelines. She also has a history of helping local Democrats win elections as a political consultant, including a significant role in helping John Ewing Jr. become the first Democrat to lead the largest city in Nebraska in roughly a decade. 
She pointed to her working-class background and her record of “doing the right thing even when it’s hard” as a plus for voters. Rhoades said the main issues she would focus on would include protecting and growing the middle class, creating jobs that pay a living wage jobs and protecting democracy.
Rhoades told the Examiner that Cavanaugh and an unnamed potential candidate had asked her and her husband, Ben, to work on their campaigns. She said she would only join the House race if she sees data that shows her in the strongest position to defeat whichever Republican emerges.
“Ben [Onkka] and I are in the process of evaluating who the strongest candidate is for the district. If it’s me, I’ll run,” Rhoades said. 
What the district wants
The polling indicates that potential Democratic primary voters in the district want someone who would fight President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, someone who can win and someone with a proven record. Rhoades described herself as a “check, check, check” on those.

In recent weeks, Rhoades was rumored to be a candidate to replace Ewing in his former position as Douglas County treasurer, but the Douglas County Board this week hinted at wanting a “non-political option” to fill the remainder of Ewing’s term, someone who won’t run for the office. 
Rhoades said her experience differentiates her from the two high-profile Democrats in the House race. She said she has held multiple elective positions for over 20 years and knows how to help Democrats win elections. 
She said that Cavanaugh could have some baggage as part of a political dynasty, and there are concerns about his potentially vacating a statehouse seat, because Republican Gov. Jim Pillen would get to appoint his replacement. 
Rhoades said Powell’s inexperience could make the race a “very difficult time.” 
“I think that this may not be the right time and the environment for … a rookie,” Rhoades said. 
Rhoades has faced some criticisms from her years in service and work with Democrats in Douglas and Sarpy Counties, including for butting heads with some fellow Democrats and some co-workers in the Douglas County Courthouse.
Rhoades emphasizes that her decision on whether to run will be “data-driven.” She says she lacks the hubris to believe that she is the only Democrat who can win. She said she would decide whether to form a federal fundraising committee or jump into the race in the coming weeks.

By virtually any measure, the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribal Nation is an incredible success story against all odds. Forcibly removed from their homeland in the Bitterroot Valley, despite not having waged war against the white settlers or army, their own “Trail of Tears” brought them to the Flathead Valley to live within the boundaries of the vastly reduced lands they retained in the Hellgate Treaty of 1855.
Although the Hellgate Treaty is widely regarded as one of the best treaties signed by any of the nation’s Indigenous people, even land supposedly reserved for the exclusive habitation of the Salish-Kootenai was opened to purchase by non-tribal settlers by the Dawes Act of 1887.  
The act’s intentions were to allocate reservation lands the tribes already owned to individual families as private property and, as part of the “civilization” of Native Americans, it required tribal members to register with the federal government to receive their “allotment.” 
The entire debacle was part of the Allotment and Assimilation Era from 1887 to 1934.  Simply put, the federal government’s plan was to force Native Americans to be “assimilated” into European-American culture.  
Importantly, any reservation lands not allocated to tribal members was deemed “surplus” land and opened to purchase by non-tribal settlers.  This excursion into reservation lands was further exacerbated by the ability of tribal members to sell their allotment parcels to non-tribal members.  
The fracturing of the Salish-Kootenai’s tribal lands through sales to non-tribal members continues to cause serious problems today, including the long and on-going battle to retain their water, hunting and fishing treaty rights.  
Article III of the Hellgate Treaty could not be more clear regarding the Tribe’s fishing rights:  

        “The exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams running through or bordering said reservation is further secured to said Indians; as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places…”    
Yet, just this week the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribal Nation issued a very serious warning to tribal members regarding the fish they have treaty rights to catch because they are poisoned.  
The Fish Consumption Advisory urges “all tribal members to avoid consuming all species and sizes of fish harvested from the lower Clark Fork River from the Bitterroot River near Missoula to the Flathead River near Paradise. Recent testing has confirmed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins and furans in fish at levels that are unsafe for consumption by Tribal peoples.  It is also advisable to avoid consuming rainbow trout and northern pike harvested from the Bitterroot River and the upper Clark Fork River above the Bitterroot River to Rock Creek, and, to avoid consuming rainbow trout from the Blackfoot River.
As the Advisory explains: “These contaminants pose a health risk to all fish consumers, and an even greater health risk to the most sensitive members of the Tribal population including women of child bearing age, pregnant nursing women, and young children. These contaminants have been linked to negative health effects in the immune, and nervous systems and may be associated with birth defects…PCBs and dioxins are classified as probable and definite human carcinogens, respectively.”
So what good are treaty fishing rights if you can’t eat the fish because they’re poisoned?  Are they really “rights” — or is this just another in our nation’s long and shameful history of abrogating its treaties with Native Americans?  
Moreover, Montana’s poison fish affect us all. Just as our government has failed the Salish-Kootenai, they have likewise failed to uphold our rights to the “swimmable/fishable waters” guaranteed by the Clean Water Act — because no one, tribal or non-tribal, is immune to poisoned fish.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Salish-men-tipis-1903.jpg,,,2025-06-27 07:00:38.061133

Wes Moore (D) is turning to a strategist with close ties to a potential rival in the 2028 White House election to helm his 2026 reelection campaign in Maryland – and possibly a national campaign beyond that.
Moore has hired Ron Owens, a Michigander who has worked as a political operative and statehouse aide for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) to run his reelection campaign.
Many Democrats – in Moore’s political orbit and beyond – had expected Ned Miller, who ran Moore’s 2022 campaign, joined his administration and later oversaw his super PAC, to head the reelection effort. But Miller has moved to Georgia, to run former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ 2026 campaign for governor.
“I’m thrilled to have Ron Owens leading our reelection campaign as our campaign manager,” Moore said in a statement provided to Maryland Matters. “Ron brings immense experience to Maryland from his work all across the country – with him on our team we will create the most aggressive statewide operation in history to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot all across Maryland.”
Though only 29, Owens is a seasoned operative who worked most recently as a campaign adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, helping Democratic Senate candidates, including now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), with strategy and campaign management.
Potential 2028 presidential hopefuls Moore, Walz steal show at South Carolina Democratic weekend

In 2023, he was campaign manager to Brandon Presley, a former state utility regulator – and cousin of Elvis Presley’s – who was the Democratic nominee for governor of Mississippi. Presley ran a surprisingly strong race in a red state, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves by just 3.2 points.
Most of Owens’ political experience, however, is in Michigan, his home state. After a stint as a legislative aide to the state House Democratic leader, Owens was the deputy political director on Whitmer’s successful 2018 campaign for governor.
He spent two years as Whitmer’s public affairs specialist in her gubernatorial office, then was political director in her 2022 reelection campaign.
After Owens was hired to run Presley’s campaign, a leading Mississippi Republican cited the operative’s ties to Whitmer as a way of blasting the Democratic contender.
“COVID showed Americans that it certainly matters who serves as governor,” Henry Barbour, the Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, told the Magnolia Tribune in 2023. “Democrats such as Gretchen Whitmer advanced their elitist, government-knows-best agenda that restricted Americans’ liberty. And Brandon Presley hired her top political operative.
“Don’t believe him for a minute when he tries to persuade you he’s not of the same political persuasion,” Barbour said.
Whitmer and Moore are both seen as top-tier potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. But while Whitmer is termed out of office at the end of 2026, Moore must first win reelection next year before he can fully focus on any hypothetical national campaign.
Still, in the early skirmishing leading up to the 2028 White House primaries, Owens’ decision to cast his lot with Moore, one of Whitmer’s potential rivals, is noteworthy, if only significant to insiders.
In a 2018 interview, Owens highlighted his work ethic and life philosophy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“One thing that my mom instilled in my siblings and me was to, one, always be kind to other people, two, always work twice as hard as anyone else and, three, whenever you’re working you should always be doing something that is benefiting others,” Owens said in an nterview with Pride Source, a Michigan LGBTQ+ publication.
“We are fortunate to have him as our leader as we seek to continue our mission to create a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said.
At this stage, Moore still has a pretty skeletal campaign operation as the 2026 election ramps up, though that is likely to change soon. But he will enter a potentially perilous campaign season without Miller, who, after guiding the governor’s first statewide campaign, became a senior adviser and director of engagement for his administration.
In the middle of last year, Miller left state government to oversee Moore’s Unity First PAC and also played a leadership role in Freedom in Reproduction – Maryland Inc., the entity that helped pass the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Moore appears to have also lost the services of his finance director, Patrick Denny, who was with the campaign since 2021.
The Moore campaign has not yet indicated who will replace Denny as finance director and it is not known who will oversee the governor’s PAC, which he largely used during the 2024 election cycle to attack Republican congressional candidates in Maryland. The PAC is now airing ads touting Moore’s economic record.

Even though he has publicly insisted in recent weeks that he is not running for president in 2028, Moore continues to behave like a possible national candidate. His trip in late May to South Carolina, site of an early and critical presidential primary, won wide attention from national political insiders and commentators.
Strategists on the popular “Hacks on Tap” podcast subsequently called Moore a “top 10” contender for 2028, and Chuck Todd, the former political director of NBC News, recently opined that Moore has the strongest resume and most gold-plated Rolodex of any of the hypothetical Democratic presidential candidates.
Moore appeared last week as a guest on “Pod Save America,” the breezy podcast hosted by former Obama administration officials. There, he explained why he’s not making plans to run for president, saying he never anticipated a career in politics and is enjoying serving as governor after starting the 2022 campaign as a relative unknown.
“I’m playing with house money right now and I love the work we’re doing in Maryland,” he said. The governor added that he will “go anywhere and everywhere” to tout the state’s progress.
Bold-faced names
Moore’s out-of-state travels continue this month, and include a recent gathering with Democrats in Virginia, which is holding closely watched statewide elections this year.
Moore is headed to a fundraising brunch in Aspen, Colorado,on Saturday, hosted by Damian O’Doherty, the former Maryland political operative and co-founder of KO Public Affairs in Baltimore, who lives now in the Rocky Mountains but often returns to his home state.

	The host committee of the event, which O’Doherty has informally dubbed “A Whole Lotta Skiers For Maryland Governor Wes Moore,” includes David Baugh, the executive director of the Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club, and a former superintendent of the Aspen School District; Rich Benenson, managing partner of the Denver office of the law firm and lobbying powerhouse Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; Gordon Bronson, chief business officer at Continuum Partners, a real estate development and financing firm; Adam Goers, a former Democratic operative with ties to former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and now the Denver-based senior vice president for corporate affairs for Columbia Care, a cannabis company; and Michael Stratton, a senior Colorado-based Democratic and corporate strategist.
Moore’s fundraiser in Colorado coincides with the Aspen Ideas Festival, the signature annual event of the Aspen Institute. According to the festival website, the confab “brings brilliant minds from around the globe to discuss the ideas that will shape tomorrow and help us understand today. From sunup to sundown, we’ll explore critical issues and uncover ideas that spark wonder.”
The festival schedule shows Moore discussing “bold, purposeful leadership” on Saturday afternoon with Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, moderated by CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.
“Big thinkers and doers share fresh ideas, challenge assumptions and ignite conversations that ripple far beyond [the Aspen conference venue],” the conference website says of the panel discussion with Moore and the other dignitaries. “Curiosity required.”
Moore is then scheduled to travel to Detroit, where he will deliver the keynote address at the Detroit NAACP’s 70th anniversary dinner on Sunday evening.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Jay Waagmeester | Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.











Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance



Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The run-away success of 33-year-old Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayor’s race shook the political establishment across the country. In Wisconsin, where Democrats are hoping to regain control of at least one legislative chamber in 2026, and where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has not yet announced whether he’ll seek a third term, Mamdani’s overthrow of the uninspiring establishment candidate and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo should trigger some serious thinking about how Democrats win in the Donald Trump era, and who they represent.
On Wednesday, the morning after the New York City primary, the Republican Party of Wisconsin put out a press release attempting to connect Mamdani to Rebecca Cooke, the Democrat planning to run in a rematch race against U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden in Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District. The through-line between Mamdani and Cooke is that Sen. Bernie Sanders has endorsed both candidates. The Wisconsin GOP seized on what it saw as a political opportunity to defend Van Orden in a statement bashing “radical Rebecca” and asking: “Does Democrat political operative Rebecca Cooke agree with her fellow Bernie endorsed candidate on his radical positions? … Keep in mind, President Trump carried WI-03 by 8 points just last year.”
Cooke, contrary to Republican campaign propaganda, is a middle-of-the-road Democrat who earned the endorsement of the Blue Dog Coalition, the most conservative Democratic group in the U.S. House. She certainly agrees with Mamdani that the housing crisis and high prices are key issues for working class voters, but she’s unlikely to support his bolder proposals like publicly owned grocery stores. And Wisconsin Republicans are wrong to think they can easily beat Democrats by accusing them of being “radical” and tying them to Mamdani and Bernie Sanders.
The real radical in the 3rd Congressional District is Van Orden, a MAGA diehard who voted to take away medical care and nutrition assistance from his own constituents, and who likes to make a spectacle of himself, yelling at pages in the U.S. Capitol and mocking Democrats who expressed grief after the assassination of a state legislator in Minnesota.
It seems likely that by 2026, when the “big, beautiful” destruction of public goods from Medicaid to the Forest Service to infrastructure and education to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy have begun to bite, voters will have had more than enough of that brand of radicalism.
Wisconsin voters have a strong independent streak. 
Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary here by 13.5 percentage points. Sanders’ anti-establishment, progressive populist message resonated particularly strongly with voters in the 3rd District, in the same counties that ultimately went for Donald Trump that year and again in 2024. 
As Democrats in our swing state try to figure out how to win again, they should take a lesson from the voters in New York City who rejected the arrogant and deeply compromised Cuomo and chose an inspiring progressive populist, catapulting him to leadership of a new generation of Democrats. 
That doesn’t mean Mamdani would win in the 3rd District, or that he’s the model for Democratic candidates everywhere. But it does say something that he triumphed over his detractors from both political parties despite their money and clout, by connecting directly with voters who were worried about housing and high prices. Like both Sanders and Trump, Mamdani presented an alternative to the political establishment and listened actively to voters’ actual concerns. He bravely stood up to big money and stale conventional wisdom. He recognized the urgency of the moment. He leveraged the enthusiasm of young people and beleaguered working people who feel overlooked. He inspired people. He was a breath of fresh air.
What does that mean for Wisconsin? 
This week the latest Marquette Poll reported that 55% of voters don’t want Evers to run for a third term as governor. Various political commentators have compared Evers to ex-President Joe Biden, warning that at 73 (almost a decade younger than Biden) he might be too old to win. The poll helped fuel a new round of that sort of speculation.
But the question for Democrats is not whether Evers should run again. Presented with no alternative, 83% of Democratic voters told Marquette pollsters they want Evers. 
The real question is, what is the party’s vision for its own future and the future of our state? For a long time, Democrats in Wisconsin have lacked a bench. If Evers decides not to run, there is no obvious candidate to take his place. Meanwhile, Evers is currently engaged in backroom negotiations with Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on the state budget. Embarrassingly, Democratic leaders in the Legislature are not included in those talks and appear not to know what’s being traded behind closed doors. 
Asked whether she thinks the closed door sessions are OK, Senate Minority Leader Diane Hesselbein told reporters, “I think this is probably normal. I’ve talked to other majority and minority leaders in the past, and this is kind of how it’s happened in the past.”
That’s it?
As legislative Democrats conduct what some have called a dress rehearsal for real power, preparing to step into the majority for the first time in more than 15 years, it’s not clear how they will govern. Will they still let a Democratic governor call all the shots in budget negotiations? Will they play hardball if a Republican takes Evers’ place — following the example of the current Republican majority and blocking every initiative the governor proposes and seizing his powers whenever they get a chance? What are their bottom-line issues? How will they transform the lives of the people of our state? 
We badly need a more functional government and a more cohesive Democratic Party in Wisconsin.
More than anything, we need bold, progressive leadership that articulates a strong vision for a government that serves the interests of the majority of voters, not just rich people and insiders. Mamdani showed that there is real hunger for that in the electorate. That should be an inspiration to Wisconsin’s future leaders.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Congress is debating many important issues as part of the “big beautiful bill.” One very concerning proposal that may be flying under the radar compared to the other provisions is a section in the U.S. House version of the bill that would impose a 600% tax increase on charitable foundations. Thankfully, this massive tax increase is not included in the U.S. Senate version.
As explained by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation: “Federal law requires grantmaking foundations to pay out 5% of their assets each year, to pay full income tax on unrelated business income (UBI), and to pay a 1.39% federal tax on investment income. OBBBA adds some well-crafted reforms (a floor to corporate charitable contributions, and closing some loopholes on UBI) but it would convert this flat tax to a progressive one based on asset size, where larger foundations pay a higher tax rate up to 10%. This tax increase will have unintended consequences, sweeping thousands of community and faith-based foundations into its scope. Large and bad are not the same thing (particularly when it comes to charitable endeavors. The Senate should avoid setting a precedent for wealth taxes and remove this tax increase.”
  Sen. Julie VanOrden, R-Pingree, conducts committee business during the Senate Health and Welfare Committee meeting on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Idaho State Sen. Julie VanOrden, R-Pingree, recently wrote an op-ed warning of the possible consequences of this tax increase on the Gem State. She said: “Idaho’s broader charitable ecosystem is equally essential. The Idaho Community Foundation has distributed more than $177 million in grants across all 44 counties. This year’s Idaho Gives campaign alone raised over $5 million for local nonprofits. These organizations thrive not because they have to, but because they choose to give. They are on a mission to serve our communities and the most vulnerable among us. Taxing that generosity is not only shortsighted; it’s self-defeating.”
Mountain States Policy Center agrees that this tax increase is the wrong approach. That is why we joined a coalition letter on June 23 to House leadership, encouraging them to remove this massive tax increase on charitable foundations from the bill as the Senate wisely did.
That coalition letter says (in part): “The draft Senate bill rightly eliminates the private foundation tax increases included in the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA). The House-passed bill would raise taxes on charities by more than 600%, allowing the IRS to take nearly $16 billion from private charitable foundations that would otherwise help improve the lives of many Americans. Countless programs and services that provide for the needs of people in every state are funded by the generosity of private citizens. Without them, we would see more Americans reliant on government, which ultimately costs us all more for what is often an inefficient bureaucratic solution.”
The letter continues: “Charitable giving helps form the bedrock of a resilient America by supporting organizations committed to creating a stronger, healthier society where every person has the opportunity to thrive. We support our nation’s long history of encouraging private initiative and generosity that benefits the common good, and we will work to advance conservative and free market policies that continue this legacy.”
Congressional leaders plan to vote on the final version of the bill before the Fourth of July. There is nothing beautiful about imposing a big 600% tax increase on charitable foundations. Let’s hope we’re also celebrating the defeat of this misguided tax increase when the fireworks go off on Independence Day.

It happened just a few weeks ago: Jim Obergefell was moving things in his office when he came across the ashes of his late husband, John Arthur, now 12 years gone. Arthur had last wishes for his ashes. Obergefell had yet to fulfill them.

This story was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“And it struck me that, oh, I am actually now mentally, emotionally ready to take care of John’s ashes,” Obergefell told The 19th. “It was the first time that I had that feeling so clearly and so strongly.”
Obergefell, 58, is ready to move on. Not exactly from the love of his life or the history-making Supreme Court decision that came after Arthur died. But certainly from the insecurities straight America was grappling with a decade ago about same-sex unions.
Obergefell is that Obergefell: the named plaintiff in the landmark lawsuit that extended marriage equality to every state in the nation in 2015. Ten years later, he celebrates that win and the many ways it rewrote his life. And in a time when LGBTQ+ rights are again under assault, he is looking to the future — of the queer rights movement and also his own.
A journey to the Supreme Court
Obergefell’s journey to the Supreme Court was hardly destined. It began 12 years ago, on June 26, 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that prohibited the government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
Obergefell and Arthur had been together for 21 years at the time. The two had discussed getting married before. But they wanted it to be legal, and their home state of Ohio didn’t offer same-sex marriages.
Arthur was gravely ill with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he barely left his home hospice bed.
After the ruling, Obergefell leaned over to Arthur, hugged, then kissed him.
“Let’s get married,” he said.
Arthur agreed.
Trump administration to end national LGBTQ+ suicide hotline

The logistics were not easy. Arthur was in no shape to travel, and the couple could not wed in Ohio. Obergefell researched and found that Maryland would let him get a marriage license even with only one of them present. But both would need to arrive in the state for the ceremony.
When friends and family learned about their predicament, they pooled together money to charter a medical jet for Arthur. The two flew to Baltimore. Over the course of 45 minutes, they exchanged vows on the tarmac before flying home.
“In the days that followed, we said the word ‘husband’ hundreds of times a day,” Obergefell said on the Decidedly Podcast in 2023.
But just five days later, their joy was muted when civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein informed them that because of Ohio’s ban on same-sex marriage, Arthur would be listed as single in death.
Arthur and Obergefell were angry. The couple sued the state of Ohio in federal district court and won. Three months later, Arthur died.
The following year, Obergefell, still in mourning, lost on appeal. But he refused to believe he might lose altogether.
“I just kept going,” Obergefell said. “It was the right thing to do.”
On June 26, 2015, he won. For the country, the win was immensely practical. Many told Obergefell it gave them so much hope it saved their lives. For Obergefell, it meant a legacy for the man he loved.
“I made promises to John to love, honor and protect him, and I was going to keep doing that,” he said.
Changing history
It’s difficult to overstate the impact of Obergefell’s case on the nation or the world. Since the 2015 ruling, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates, 591,000 queer couples have wed, generating an estimated $5.9 billion in wedding spending for state and local economies.
It has also radically transformed Obergefell’s life. Introverted and unassuming, he has spent the last decade campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights. He helms Equality Vines, a wine company that donates its proceeds to advancing civil rights causes.
It’s a position that makes him deeply proud if not a little fatigued.
“I’m not tired of talking about it,” he said of the 10-year anniversary of the ruling. “I’m just physically tired from all of the interviews and the photographers and the speaking gigs and the events. Yes, I’m exhausted.”
For 12 years, Obergefell has kept Arthur alive through retelling their story countless times in courtrooms and for the media. That exercise, of telling and retelling, helped Obergefell process his profound loss.
But he has never recoupled. It wasn’t that Arthur didn’t want him to. In fact, Arthur told him regularly that he wanted him to find love again. He asked his friends and family to tell Obergefell that he wanted him to find love after he was gone.
“I know it was sincere, because he told me that he had other people tell me that,” Obergefell said.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors

It isn’t about the pressure he feels as the face of marriage equality, he said, though part of him wonders what it would be like to date after making history.
“I don’t know how to date,” he confessed. “I’m clueless when people flirt with me, and as much as I hate it, and I don’t go into any conversation or anything like this, but you know, there’s that part of me that sometimes wonders, you know, are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in me as Jim Obergefell, named plaintiff?”
Obergefell’s name has become synonymous with marriage equality in the United States, an issue that has not always united the LGBTQ+ community. Some queer activists have argued that same-sex marriage was a misguided goal for the movement as queer youth continue to face high rates of homelessness and transgender people grapple with police violence and incarceration, among other issues.
More work to do
Obergefell, too, is worried that the needs of the community’s most vulnerable have gone unmet. He has watched horror-struck over the last five years as state legislatures have moved to restrict transgender rights.
“We need to fight for every marginalized community, because the queer community includes every marginalized community, and equality for one is pointless without equality for all,” he said. “I didn’t go to the Supreme Court just so White, cisgender, gay men like me could get married.”
Despite all of the setbacks in LGBTQ+ rights, and even threats to Obergefell’s game-changing victory, he is hopeful — and feels stronger than ever. People assume his case was difficult for him. It was, but the path was also obvious, to him and to Arthur. They loved each other.
“If we weren’t willing to fight for each other and for what was right, then what’s the point?”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents riled up folks when they conducted a dragnet in a South Nashville neighborhood a month ago and detained nearly 200 people.
But city streets aren’t the only place where federal agents are picking up immigrants for deportation. The Davidson County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Thursday it has released 283 inmates to ICE custody in 2025, notably higher than last year’s number.
Oddly enough, the sheriff’s office doesn’t have information on whether those inmates have legal documentation to be in the country. It sends fingerprints collected in the booking process to national databases, including those ICE is able to access, according to spokesman Jon Adams.
ICE contacts the sheriff’s office to request a detainer, then picks up the inmate, leaving the local agency with nothing but a number of people released to federal custody.



				Based on the 283 inmates released by the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Metro Nashville appears to be cooperating with the federal agency on deportation, despite claims to the contrary by Republican lawmakers. 			


The Davidson County Sheriff’s Office hasn’t participated in the 287(g) screening program for immigrant inmates since 2012 when Sheriff Daron Hall said it was so successful it was no longer needed. For the five years the department used the program, it processed more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants for removal from the country, according to a WPLN report.
But based on the jail pickups, Metro Nashville appears to be cooperating with the feds, even though Republican lawmakers are hammering at Democratic Mayor Freddie O’Connell after he raised concerns about the Nashville sweep. Metro inadvertently posted the names of three ICE agents, then removed them, and O’Connell updated a years-old executive order requiring personnel to notify the mayor’s office if they encounter any federal agents, including those from ICE. Those moves spurred Republican legislation to punish governments that ID ICE agents, and GOP leaders have called on O’Connell to rescind the notification order.
Tennessee GOP Congressman calls for investigation of Nashville mayor amid immigrant detentions

Since opting out of the program, the sheriff’s office no longer serves as an extension of the federal ICE program. But based on the number of jail deportations, they have quite a few encounters with the federal agents. 
Republican leaders have said repeatedly over the last few months that new laws are needed to remove undocumented criminals who pose a public safety threat. 
Those have been under way, though, for nearly two decades. 
Former President Barack Obama removed more than 4 million people, earning him the moniker “deporter in chief.” Former President Joe Biden deported 271,000 immigrants in 2024, according to a BBC report. Over the first four months of this year, the Trump administration removed about 200,000 people from the country.
Based on those numbers, undocumented immigration is nothing new, and neither are deportations. Some just cause more chaos than others.
Trying to get off the radar
Tennessee State University broke ground Thursday on two academic buildings for the College of Agriculture, but the historically Black college will remain under a state microscope for a good minute.
As part of an agreement signed last week with state leaders, the university must meet several financial requirements in order to shift more than $90 million from a 2022 capital grant to campus operations over the next three years.

In addition to making a quarterly report to the Tennessee Board of Regents, comptroller and commissioner of Finance and Administration, TSU must meet deficit reduction goals and cut yearly expenses, fix state audit findings, come up with a space use and real property plan, and set find an enrollment figure it can handle without going broke.
State officials reached the agreement with TSU and interim President Dwayne Tucker after forcing out former President Glenda Glover and replacing the board of trustees in 2024. 
TSU and Glover caught the ire of Republican senators when the university sought last-second approval to lease apartments for student housing when it started an aggressive scholarship program after the COVID pandemic. The university used a federal grant to fund the scholarships, then ran out of money.
In the last year, state leaders have been micromanaging the university’s money with Tucker, who is working without pay, to put TSU on stronger financial footing.
The estimated $90 million buildings for the Food and Animal Sciences and Environmental Sciences programs will support the university’s academic, research and agriculture extension missions.
“This project underscores the state’s continued confidence in our university and the strength of our land-grant mission,” Tucker said in a statement.
  “The hard work starts now,” state Comptroller Jason Mumpower recently told Dwayne Tucker, interim president of Tennessee State University. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout 2024)
Republican senators have said consistently they want TSU to succeed, yet they didn’t show any confidence in the administration until recent months. State officials allowed TSU to take an advance last fall on the $250 million in capital funding, just to make payroll and stay afloat.
A state study found TSU had been shorted by as much as $500 million over many decades, while a federal report said the university was shorted by more than $2 billion, a figure Republicans are rejecting. Either way, TSU has battled with finances for years, struggling to balance the books and resolve audit findings, even if state investigations found no wrongdoing. 
State Comptroller Jason Mumpower, one of Glover’s biggest critics, said he has confidence in Tucker. After the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding, Mumpower said he told the interim president that “the hard work starts now.” 
The question is whether they can repair decades of underfunding, bad management and, some might say, neglect on the part of a lot of people in high positions.
Cepicky’s pick
Republican state Rep. Scott Cepicky said on a podcast this week he’s picking House Speaker Cameron Sexton to win the 7th Congressional District seat expected to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Mark Green.
“The wild card here is Sexton,” Cepicky said on “3 Dudes with a View,” a Columbia production. He added that his “gut feeling” is Sexton will win if he gets in.
Sexton’s office has consistently declined comment, but he is set to make a big announcement in August. 
For the second time, Green announced his decision to leave the post, once Congress votes on the president’s budget plan. 
Cepicky declined to comment Thursday to the Lookout on whether Sexton told him he will run for the post.
The prediction is tempered somewhat because Cepicky also said Sen. Bill Powers could be a strong candidate, even though Powers announced last week he won’t run.
While Sexton’s potential candidacy is bandied about, former Tennessee General Services Commission Matt Van Epps announced this week that Nashville car dealership magnate Lee Beaman and his wife, Julie, will be finance co-chairs for his 7th District campaign. 
Beaman also served as treasurer of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles’ first campaign when he was late filing his Federal Election Commission report and reported raising much less money than he initially claimed. The FBI was investigating him, but Trump squashed that probe when Ogles came to his defense.
Beaman also was the sole donor of $50,000 to Volunteers for Freedom PAC, which put $24,000 into an ad buy backing Ogles, raising questions about illegal coordination between the campaign and PAC.
AI argument
State Sen. Bo Watson joined Republican lawmakers from across the country Thursday in urging Congress not to approve a 10-year moratorium on artificial intelligence laws as part of the president’s budget bill.
Watson, chair of the Senate finance committee, adamantly opposes a ban on states and local governments regulating artificial intelligence systems, models and decision systems for children’s online safety, consumer protections, transparency and accountability measures and “generative AI harms,” which could build up societal biases in data and potentially allow sensitive personal data to be stolen. (This is making my brain hurt.)










For an administration who has really been focused on returning authority back to the states, this is one aspect of this piece of legislation that I’m quite disappointed in.


– Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson


Watson invoked Tennessee’s new law preventing “deep fakes” and the ELVIS Act, which protects artists from infringement on their voices and images, during a Thursday webinar on the subject with lawmakers nationwide who oppose the federal ban. The moratorium would withhold broadband funding in exchange for doing nothing.
“For an administration who has really been focused on returning authority back to the states, this is one aspect of this piece of legislation that I’m quite disappointed in,” said Watson, a member of the state’s council overseeing AI policy.
Watson, a Hixson Republican, added that Congress is so slow to act that by the time it deals with problems stemming from AI, the states will be left to “wrestle” with the consequences.
“That’s why it’s critically important that this part of the bill be removed,” Watson said, and states be allowed to work with the feds on AI laws.
It might not be the only rough part of the federal legislation.
Congress also is considering cutting Medicaid spending that could cause Tennessee’s TennCare program to lose $16 billion in federal funding, according to U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, brother of former Tennessee state Rep. Rick Tillis.
The pending and potential budget buster for Tennessee is accompanied by a massive uptick in national spending for ICE and border patrol and an overall increase that even former DOGE director Elon Musk opposes. 
This proposed expansion of federal control over AI coincides with U.S. deportation efforts nationwide despite opposition in many states, renewing the age-old states’ rights argument that was supposedly put to rest 160 years ago. Some folks want the states to prevail only when it’s politically expedient, presenting a bit of a contradiction.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Pedestrians and bicyclists along the Colorado Riverfront Trail in Grand Junction may have noticed something out of the ordinary this spring. In some fenced-off sections near Blue Heron Lake, 700 goats are grazing on an array of invasive species such as tamarisk, Russian olive, kochia, and Russian knapweed.
Grand Junction is using goats to combat noxious weeds to make more room for native plants like cottonwood trees and willows. At the same time, they are lowering the risk of wildfire in this hot, dry, high-desert landscape by reducing the vegetative fuel load. 
“It can be hard to stop a fire where there’s lots of vegetation,” said Rob Davis, Grand Junction forester and open space supervisor. “If it gets going on a windy day, and there’s lots of downed debris …with 9 inches of precipitation a year, and high summer temperatures, the fire risk is high. Using goats for grazing is an environmentally-friendly strategy to help us reduce fire risks and knock down some of our invasive weeds.” 
Plus, people out recreating enjoy seeing the goats, Davis added.
“There’s that added benefit that people just like it,” he said.

A goatherder watches over the goats and nudges them down the trail after they’ve sufficiently grazed a patch of dead or unwanted vegetation. Goats will typically leave the mature cottonwoods and willows alone. However, the city sometimes places a fence around young trees to keep the goats from munching on the saplings.
On the Front Range in Boulder County, the town of Superior has brought in a herd of 300 goats to graze on its open spaces for both weed control and fire mitigation. The catastrophic Marshall Fire in 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the region.
Superior first began using goats in 2019, as a sustainable method for vegetation management. After the Marshall Fire the town “doubled down” on using goats for fire mitigation, said Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space. 
Superior evaluates its open space properties annually to prioritize where to graze the goats each summer and winter, Clark said. Properties are monitored to gauge results before and after grazing. 
“Initial results look positive,” Clark said. “People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural. The city later reseeds the areas with native species to improve biodiversity and reduce the number of noxious weeds.”










People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural.


– Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space


Using goats for weed control and fire mitigation is not new. Lani Malmberg, owner of Colorado-based Goat Green, said she was the first company to offer this type of fire mitigation work 25 years ago. She and her goats have been featured in The New York Times, the L.A. Times, and other national publications. She now runs her Goat Green grazing business with her son Donny Benz and his fiancée.
Malmberg, 68, said she conceived the idea of using goats decades ago while studying botany, biology and environmental restoration at then-Mesa State College in Grand Junction. She said she watched how knapweed took over a cornfield while working a summer job in Colorado. 
It occurred to her then, “Someone ought to run a business to eat the problem,” Malmberg recalled. “Now there are a lot of goat businesses” — and she has trained people at some of them.
Lockheed Martin uses 1,200 of Malmberg’s goats for fire mitigation at its facility in Littleton. Goat Green has done grazing projects for many Colorado cities in the past, including Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Castle Pines, Broomfield, Golden, Glenwood Springs and Carbondale.
“Over the past 30 years I have worked in all the Western states, doing fire mitigation in California, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana and Nebraska,” Malmberg said. 
When asked where her company is based, she replied, “Under my hat — wherever I’m on contract.”
“Fire mitigation is a big deal. Open space (managers) are clamoring to get goats. People are jumping into it. It’s an alternative to machinery and chemicals.”
More environmentally friendly than chemicals
Superior pays for the goat service via grants from FEMA and Boulder County, with matching grants provided by the town of Superior. The program is funded from 2025 through 2027. 
Louisville has used goats to control noxious weeds for several years, said Nathaniel Goeckner, the city’s natural resource supervisor. Louisville contracts with Goats on the Go, in Boulder County, to graze 200 goats on open space around Louisville. Depending on the vegetation, the city also uses cattle for fire mitigation work, Goeckner said. Its grazing program is paid for with grants from Boulder County and a city sales tax.
Longmont also uses goats — though not for fire mitigation, said Jim Krick, ecosystem manager for Longmont’s Parks and Natural Resources. The city has brought in goats since 2023 for weed control — targeting kochia in particular, where it competes with native plants. The goats are brought in just before the weeds form and spread their seeds, Krick said. Longmont typically grazes goats on an acre per year based on its budget.

Grand Junction contracts with Ecological Grazing Service, owned by Jennifer Studt, who, along with her husband, raises goats and sheep on a ranch in nearby Loma. She hires a goatherder who stays with the goats the entire time, moving his small camper, and the goats, down the trail when an area is sufficiently grazed. 
Studt says goats do particularly well here because they have a more resilient stomach. They can eat poisonous plants like Russian knapweed, which is highly toxic to most animals — but not goats, she said. And, whereas Russian olive seeds pass through other animals’ dung, which then gets repopulated elsewhere, in a goat’s gut the seed won’t survive, Studt said. Therefore, goats don’t spread noxious weeds.
Studt’s goats began grazing along the riverfront May 23 and will finish eating their way along the trail by the end of this month. They’ll return in late October, when other annual weeds begin to germinate. 
“There are bucket loads of dead noxious weeds here,” Studt said. “And while goats will eat live plants too, they really like the crunchy, dead material — a lot of other animals not so much. Goats like a lot of roughage in their diet. We’re taking something noxious, poisonous to other animals and turn it into fertilizer which helps overall soil health — which helps the native plants come back.”
Using goats to reduce fuel loads, and invasive plant species is a more environmentally friendly method than using chemicals, Davis said. The Grand Junction program is funded through the city’s operating budget.
Although using goats doesn’t necessarily eliminate the use of herbicides, it reduces the amount of chemicals used in grazing areas, said Grand Junction spokesperson Kelsey Coleman in an email to Colorado Newsline. 
The town of Superior contracts with Goat Bros, which Clark said offers educational days when the public can meet the goats close up, and learn how goats improve the environment. 
“It’s an opportunity to get closer to the goats,” Clark said. “We don’t want people interacting with them, otherwise — they’re working.”

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Standing behind a sign that read, “Education Not Indoctrination,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey celebrated a bill Thursday that he says will “reinforce civic values” in education by putting a new learning center on West Virginia University’s campus.
For Morrisey, the legislation is a part of his priority to combat what he says is the “woke agenda.” The Republican governor already banned diversity initiatives in state government, and, as a result, WVU closed its Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and opened a new, rebranded office.
House Bill 3297, passed by the GOP-led legislature in April, mandates that WVU operate the “Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship” focused on teaching constitutional studies and “great debates of Western civilization.” It will also present the “fact-based instruction on America’s founding,” according to the governor’s office.
“We need to make sure that students are learning how to think, not what to think,” Morrisey  said.
Morrisey gets to choose its initial director, according to the bill. He is required to make that decision in consultation with the Senate and WVU’s Board of Governors. 
“Unfortunately, a lot of our schools and higher education institutions they’ve turned into indoctrination factories for radical, anti-American thinking. That can’t happen in West Virginia,” he said. 
  Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock
Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, sponsored the Washington Center legislation.
“I just want something established … to start allowing an option for students that attend higher education … to study all these different subjects under their humanities as they’ve been traditionally taught,” he said at the press conference.
Along with a director, the bill requires the university to hire five additional faculty, which comes in the wake of WVU eliminating around 300 faculty and staff jobs for financial reasons. 
The Washington Center can use existing faculty and courses to accomplish the bill’s requirements of civics instruction. The measure says it should advance the “understanding of American constitutional thought and institutions.”
Shauna Johnson, WVU’s executive director of strategic communications, said the university looks forward to building on its programs and long history of civics instruction. 
“As our nation prepares to celebrate its 250th anniversary next year, West Virginia University looks forward to building on its programs and long history of civics instruction,” she wrote in a statement. “The Washington Center will give us the opportunity to enhance our work to develop responsible and informed citizens and highlight the importance of our institutions and democratic framework.”
Democratic lawmakers in the House of Delegates and Senate who represent Morgantown voted against the legislation, citing concerns about government mandates for a university and a political appointee overseeing academics. 
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, told House members during bill debate that he worried about who might want to fund the school if the state doesn’t. 
“Who will want to pay to have a say in how we educate the next generation?” he asked. 
Senators amended the bill to require that Washington Center’s curriculum be approved by WVU’s Board of Governors. They also added in language that banned lawmakers, during or up to two years after the end of their service in the legislature, from serving as the center’s director or being employed by the center in any capacity. 
While the bill initially didn’t come with funding for the center’s director and faculty, the final budget bill contained $1.5 million for WVU to use on the center. 
Johnson didn’t respond to a question from West Virginia Watch about whether it would take additional university funds to get the center up and running. 
The legislation goes into effect July 11. 
“We appreciate the governor and legislature for including $1.5 million in the fiscal year 2026 budget to support the creation and operations of the Washington Center,” Johnson wrote. “More details will be available at a later date.”
Earlier this year, McGeehan was involved in a controversial move by the West Virginia Water Development Authority to give $5 million to an Ohio-based Catholic-affiliated career and vocational college to create a right-wing think tank. The Parkersburg News and Sentinel reported that McGeehan helped the College of St. Joseph the Worker with their application for WDA funds. 
The water development authority, which made the decision without a required recommendation from one of three state officials, said the deal is constitutional because it will serve a non-religious economic purpose of teaching trade skills. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia sued to block the water development authority from using the money in Ohio, and a judge recently ruled that the suit can move forward in court.

That’s according to Department of State Police spokesperson Shanon Banner, who told Michigan Advance in an email that Nugent had a weapon on him due to a breakdown in security screening. Nugent appeared Wednesday before a joint hearing of three different House committees mostly to rail against deer-bating and other conservation regulations from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission.
Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livionia), who called his testimony and invitation to speak before legislators “absurd,” posted on TikTok Thursday that it appeared that Nugent had a weapon on him while he stood and practically yelled at members of the House for more than 10 minutes. Pohutsky’s seat at the large dais in the House Appropriations Room at the state Capitol was directly in front of where Nugent was sitting.

Open carry and concealed carry of firearms are both banned on Capitol grounds, with limited exceptions.
Banner later confirmed that Nugent did have a weapon on him.
“Mr. Nugent was screened at the north entrance of the Capitol [Wednesday]. The weapons detection system functioned correctly and alerted to a possible weapon; however, the trooper staffing the entry point did not see the alert until after Mr. Nugent left the screening area,” Banner said via email. “Upon completing his meeting, MSP personnel contacted Mr. Nugent and notified him of the weapons policy, and he complied. We are still evaluating how the weapons detection alert was missed and will be following up to ensure this does not happen again.”
Banner did not say what kind of weapon Nugent had on his person when testifying before legislators.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)To marry an old idiom to modern jargon, “can’t see the forest for the trees” is a bandwidth problem. 
Cognitive bandwidth; that is a fancy way of saying “limited attention ability” in people, as opposed to the computer version and definition of bandwidth. This is natural for human beings. Focusing on a few things intensely as opposed to a broad array of things is just how most folks are wired. Add in modern technology where focus is personally curated exactly to what folks want to see on their screens, and you get a populace of folks who can stream their favorite trees 24/7, forest be damned. 
Getting the right kind of trees in front of the right kind of voters means the forest is ripe for harvest. Just a matter of bandwidth. 
The post-COVID vaccine debate takes up oodles of bandwidth. This past legislative session saw considerable time, effort and coverage to the ultimately rejected Senate Bill 460. That failure, the culmination of years’ worth of efforts by activists, was followed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey issuing an executive order on religious exemptions for vaccines on his second day in office. Thus, we have the sequence of events that led to the Beckley press conference. The podium had a placard made up stating “protecting religious liberty” to add another layer of search engine optimized branding to the program. The purpose of the proceedings was for Morrisey to publicly throw his support behind a very convenient lawsuit that highlights this very issue and will move the vaccine exemption matter into the courts and around the legislative and state school board impasse. 
 In review, the sitting governor, the legislature, the court system, the news media coverage, the social media attention and all of those views being terraformed by the national news cycle on the same topic… that is a whole lot of bandwidth on this one issue. Which gives the impression it is an issue enormously affecting a whole bunch of West Virginians.
But does the noise match the numbers? In 2023, 53 exemptions were requested with the West Virginia Board of Public Health,  with nine permanent and 24 temporary exemptions granted.  With all the attention on the issue, 321 exemptions were requested for the past school year, as reported by Lori Kersey. That is 321 requests out of 245,047 total students. With some calculator help for my Frametown Elementary math skills, which comes out to 0.130995278% of the students in West Virginia. 
 That’s a lot of bandwidth for a number that is percentage-wise on the south side of zero. 
Medically, when dealing with the infectious disease vaccines are designed to prevent, that small percentage could be enormous if it — God forbid — would involve a polio or measles outbreak. Constitutionally, every citizen’s rights are supposed to be equal under the law as is their right to redress any grievances they might have with their government. Morally, in a perfect world every person would matter just as much as every other person. But we don’t live in that world. Which is why fights over rights are so important. These are vital, foundational issues wrapped up in the messaging of the moment. 
Politically, though, this is an exercise in how focusing a political base on a certain kind of tree while broader focus gets fuzzy is vital to modern electoral engagement. Religious freedom rhetoric, mixed with recently well-earned distrust of the marriage of health science and government, poured into a “for the children” mold makes political dynamite. Lighting off that stick of dynamite doesn’t sound as justified when it is framed as making a large explosion that affects the many under the extremely specific projected needs of the decimal point few. A large socio-political boom chiefly made because such a bang will be particularly useful to the folks with ambitious plans. 
Principles do not have to exist at odds with proportionality in our popular politics. When politicians insist they must, it is a red flag that something is going on in the rest of the forest and we should step back from the tree at hand to see what it is. Being able to say, “This is an important issue, but…” and taking in the full context of not just the issue but the moment is the first basic step in not being railroaded into action just because so-and-so said so. Using all of one’s bandwidth on one or two issues leaves a perspective that is not only skewed, but susceptible to undue influence.
Increasingly, that’s the standard operation procedure for our office holders, media coverage and personal policy opinions. Entities that have incentives to keep all the focus only on the trees they want the focus to be on. Like debates over a few hundred vaccine exemptions that distract from the dozens of school closures. An issue that, when you look closely, is becoming a platform for giving the governor more power over the state school board. A power struggle over schools and who controls them that comes as a larger fight over the ever-increasing state burden to fund school choice looms. All of that coming after a half-century of school consolidations for the majority of West Virginia that isn’t the panhandle or Potomac Highlands. There are a whole lot of trees in this particular policy forest that can be stared long and hard at.  
It would be ridiculous to be in West Virginia and never notice the forests that blanket the hills for lack of bandwidth to see it. Yet many are doing that with politics, losing all perspective to the power of the moment. There is no vaccine to keep from losing perspective and proportionality in our politics. Only prevention.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Vaccine-GettyImages-1344323367-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)President Donald Trump recently declared, “We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were a tariff country.” More recently, at a University of Alabama commencement, he proclaimed the graduates were “the first of the Golden Age of America,” suggesting they could become “the greatest generation” of Americans. 
While his nostalgia is clear, it’s essential to recognize that the so-called “Golden Age” he envisions closely resembles the Gilded Age — a time when America’s wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority struggled with poor working conditions, low wages and limited opportunities. 
The economic boom of that era, fueled by monopolies and unregulated capitalism, was far from the broad-based prosperity that Trump’s “Golden Age” would seem to promise.
Yes, during the Gilded Age, America’s GDP grew swiftly. Steel output soared, railroads expanded, and millions of immigrants were welcomed to the U.S. But beneath the surface was a society defined by extreme inequality, labor exploitation, monopolistic power and systemic political corruption. These weren’t merely side effects of rapid growth; they were central to how the U.S. political economy functioned at the turn of the 20th century.
The danger of deregulated nostalgia
In “Why Nations Fail,” Nobel Prize-winning economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson explain that long-term prosperity comes not from tariffs or deregulation, but from inclusive institutions, meaning institutions that provide broad access to opportunity, protect property rights, invest in public infrastructure and empower people to shape their future. By contrast, extractive institutions are designed to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few — exactly what defined the Gilded Age President Trump’s “Golden Age” so clearly seeks to model.
Advocates of resurrecting that era often praise interstate competition through “race-to-the-bottom” deregulation and minimal federal oversight as keys to success. In reality, regulatory competition of the Gilded Age forced states to gut labor protections and enable corporate exploitation. Far from fostering inclusive growth, this “race to the bottom” entrenched extractive systems that crushed social mobility, stagnated wages, and concentrated wealth and power in the hands of a few. It wasn’t a model of progress; it was a system built to benefit economic elites at the expense of the working majority.
It wasn’t until the Progressive Era that the U.S. began confronting the damage. Reforms such as child labor laws, antitrust regulations and food safety measures started the shift away from extractive norms. While leaders like Theodore Roosevelt played a role in breaking up monopolies and expanding basic protections, the broader transformation came from a growing demand for fairness and economic inclusion.
These reforms didn’t just tweak the system; they largely dismantled an economy rigged for elites and began building one that served the many. The New Deal and postwar investments in infrastructure, education and health care weren’t acts of charity: They were strategic moves that transformed the U.S. into a global powerhouse. As “Why Nations Fail” makes clear, it is inclusive institutions — not trickle-down fantasies of a renewed Gilded Age — that drive real prosperity. They unleash innovation, expand opportunity and create growth that benefits an entire society, not just those perched at the top.
Fiscal warnings and misguided solutions
Today, that inclusive foundation is under threat from rising inequality, debt-driven growth and a creeping nostalgia for policies that favor power and wealth consolidation over competition, like many embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie’s recent floor speech offers a needed warning: The current trajectory of fiscal irresponsibility — massive spending increases without real planning — is unsustainable. “We’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg,” he said, blasting what he called “fantasy math.” His critique of growing deficits and deceptive budgeting is valid. But the answer is not a retreat into Gilded Age austerity.
Slashing investments in education, health care, food security and infrastructure undermine the very foundations of inclusive growth. Fiscal discipline should mean aligning spending with long-term, broad-based investments — not dismantling the systems that support families, such as Medicaid for health care, SNAP for food assistance, Job Corps for workforce training, and federal grants for access to higher education.
Real greatness requires looking forward, not back
The real lesson of the Gilded Age isn’t that less government is better: It’s that bad government enables extraction, corruption and exclusion, eroding a nation’s future from within. President Trump’s calls for a new “Golden Age” echo the same flawed logic that underpinned the Gilded Age: Prioritize corporate power, promote race-to-the-bottom interstate deregulation, and treat public investment as waste. It’s not a vision of shared prosperity; it’s a blueprint for repeating one of the most unequal and unstable periods in U.S. history.
Today’s challenges, from deindustrialization and climate risk to a rapidly aging population, demand more than misguided nostalgia. They require systems built for resilience, fairness and broad participation. That means not dismantling institutions and disengaging, but doubling down on smart, inclusive institutions that empower the many rather than protect the privileged few.
If we want true American greatness in the 21st century, we must invest wisely, govern inclusively, and stay clear-eyed about the past. The Gilded Age was not a golden era; it was, as Mark Twain famously observed, gilded: shiny on the surface, but hiding rot beneath. Even HBO’s “The Gilded Age,” with all its glamorous fashion and opulent parties, doesn’t shy away from showing the bitter realities of the era — systemic inequality, exploitation of labor, and entrenched power structures that served the wealthy few.
President Trump may try to brand this chapter of American history as a “Golden Age,” but no amount of nostalgic gloss can hide what this age may truly be: an economy built on exclusion and extraction. History should remind us that it’s a path we cannot afford to walk again. The Gilded Age is history, so let’s work to keep it that way.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

It was my first time teaching high schoolers, and I was nervous.
But Carter — confident, articulate, and full of charm — quickly put me at ease. He spoke with sophistication, shared his dream of becoming an interior designer, and talked excitedly about acai bowls and fashion trends. So when a reading pretest revealed he recognized just 23% of letter sounds and was reading and writing at a kindergarten level, I was shocked.
Carter’s story is not unique—and that’s exactly the problem. According to the 2024 Nation’s Report Card (NAEP), a staggering 71% of Pennsylvania eighth graders scored basic or below basic in reading. While headlines often focus on early elementary reading struggles, too many older students quietly slip through the cracks, lacking foundational literacy skills by the time the curriculum shifts to “reading to learn.”
By then, the help they need is often unavailable. Teachers are expected to bridge these enormous gaps without the training or tools to do so. They want to help students succeed, but too many are entering classrooms without the tools they need to support children who read and write years below their age-appropriate grade level.  We are losing a generation of students to a literacy crisis that is both preventable and solvable.
Here’s where we can start: Require every teacher, regardless of grade level or content area, to receive evidence-based training in the science of reading. My personal struggle to access high-quality science of reading training, despite scholarships and grants, highlights a widespread systemic barrier for dedicated teachers. Our state must prioritize professional learning initiatives, partnering with experts to provide the essential skills educators need. No teacher should face such obstacles when striving to improve student literacy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
We can leverage the Pennsylvania Reading Leadership Council, formed in January 2025 to advise the Pennsylvania Department of Education on the development and maintenance of reading instruction and curriculum. This council can help ensure that all teacher training aligns with the science of reading.
During my 16th year as a teacher, I completed the AIM Institute for Learning & Research’s Pathways to Proficient Reading course, which provided me with a deep, research-backed understanding of how children learn to read, practical strategies, and ongoing support to implement that knowledge effectively, ultimately leading to improved literacy outcomes for my students.
The course content is explicitly designed around the vast body of research on how the brain learns to read. This includes critical components like phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
Before completing this course, I lacked the strategies to help students like Carter — students who had missed out on explicit instruction in phonics, spelling patterns, and syllables. This course gave me a clear understanding of how children learn to read and what to do when they struggle.
With this knowledge, I was able to give Carter what he’d been missing: instruction grounded in structure, not guesswork. In just six weeks, he gained six months of reading growth. On the last day of our program, Carter smiled and said, “I used to hate reading, but I kind of like it now.” He even asked to take home some of the stories we’d read together, “Beds for the Kids” and “On the Job With Bill”— and he added “kindergarten teacher” to his list of possible careers.
If that’s what six weeks of structured literacy can do, imagine what’s possible with sustained, statewide training and support for all teachers.
In 2024, Louisiana’s fourth-grade reading scores soared 32% above the national average after partnering with the AIM Institute. Louisiana isn’t the only state driving change through teacher training. Mississippi, also collaborating with experts in the field, achieved a stunning feat: first in the nation for 4th grade and 8th-grade reading on NAEP results. Pennsylvania must follow suit. We need a similar partnership with the AIM Institute to equip every educator to teach reading and writing effectively.
It’s time for Pennsylvania to stop waiting and start leading.
By encouraging the Literacy Leadership Council to partner with science of reading experts to train teachers in effective literacy instruction, we can ensure every child learns to read and write, building a stronger future for our Commonwealth.  Every student should be able to walk into a classroom and be met by a teacher who knows how to teach them to decode words, understand language structures, and unlock the world of reading, just like I did with Carter.

The top priority: to send more hurricane aid west, as the mountains recovered from the deadliest storm in state history. And lawmakers had to meet a regular obligation, approving a state budget for the next two years.
But as so often happens on Jones Street, compromise did not come easily.
As the final days of regular business ticked by six months later, the General Assembly found themselves unable to agree on either issue — stuck in closed-door negotiations, bogged down in procedural debate and besieged by angry shrimpers.
A final breakthrough on Helene relief came Thursday — an agreement between the House and Senate to send $500 million to the western mountains.
But Republicans, who maintain strong control of the legislature, failed to find a middle ground on the budget. They left Raleigh without a new deal, and with a gulf wide enough to be branded “philosophical differences” by the Speaker of the House.
“We’re kind of holding tight right now,” Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters. “And making sure we’re not spending too much until we get the taxation resolved.”
The session was Hall’s first as speaker, and his fifth overall. He’s waved away questions of productivity and pointed to past budget struggles to say that the current stalemate is nothing new. His counterpart across the building voiced a similar sentiment.
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), in his second decade in the role, was frank in his assessment of where budget negotiations stand.
“I think the whole thing boils down, in many respects, to insistence on the part of the House to try and renegotiate agreements that we’ve made in the past,” Berger told reporters. “And we were not willing to do that.”

Democrats remain in the minority in both chambers, though modest gains in the House have at times complicated the math for Republicans.
But both Democratic caucuses left the Legislative Building Thursday exasperated — arguing that the nonexistent budget was a result of GOP dysfunction and bad priorities.
“This is what happens when you’ve got supermajorities,” House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said. “Suddenly it becomes about everything but trying to help out folks. Because here’s the thing, at some level, you’ve got to govern.”
Democrats entered the session with a new leader of their own — as Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) took the reins of the Senate caucus after Sen. Dan Blue’s (D-Wake) long tenure in the role.
“I think they’ve actually been at a stalemate,” Batch said of Republican leaders. “And they’ve been using each other’s bills to go ahead and fight with one another.”
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday evening that the state faced “urgent challenges” that “need to be addressed through a fiscally responsible, full budget.”
What’s done: Helene aid, phones in schools & more
All told, the current General Assembly has sent over $1 billion in state dollars to western North Carolina for hurricane relief. That came in the form of two aid packages — one in March, and another this week.
Combined with two bills approved last fall, the legislature has spent around $1.9 billion to help the mountains recover from the record shattering disaster.
Republican leaders remained adamant that it was their top priority — but also stressed caution, not wanting to front-run federal aid or plunge the state into difficult financial straits.



That approach resulted in some long-requested line-items, like a grant program for small businesses, being left on the cutting room floor. Democrats, who frequently pushed for more investment but were seldom consulted, backed the aid bills but said they wanted to see more.
Among the other bipartisan-backed bills that crawled across the finish line: regulations on cell phone use in schools.
House Bill 959 requires districts to set cell phone policies. At minimum, students are barred from using them during class time. And the bill also asks districts to establish guidelines on internet use for students.
It received just one vote in opposition (Sen. Ralph Hise, R-Mitchell).
Other proposals now sitting on Stein’s desk proved far more contentious.
A trio of bills aim to wipe diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from all corners of the public sector — targeting K-12 schools, higher education and state government.
Republicans have taken after the Trump administration’s focus on the issue, aiming to eliminate diversity trainings and inclusive hiring practices. Democrats strongly opposed the measures, calling them harmful and chilling to academic freedom.
And one of the most controversial bills of the session started as a broadly popular plan — to crack down on “revenge porn” and sexual exploitation.
But when House Bill 805 reached the Senate, it took on a new identity: one loaded with conservative measures defining biological sex, recognizing just two genders and regulating school library books.
“We cannot ignore the biological realities,” Sen. Buck Newton (R-Wilson) said during floor debate.
Senate Democrats, infuriated by the changes, began to tie the chamber in procedural knots. An hour-long rules debate culminated in Batch waving a stack of cash in the air, declaring she would pay her members’ fines for failing to vote “yes” or “no.”
Batch called the culture war amendments a “poison pill.”
“They’re not going to go ahead and kill it themselves,” she said. “They just put a lot of other things on it, instead of letting bills just die or get passed on [their] own.”
In the end, the bill did pass, changes and all. The House approved of the changes — this time without Democratic support.

Veto battles: Immigration and guns
It took months into his first term for Stein to finally uncap his veto pen. Now that he has, Republicans will attempt to override him.
As of Thursday evening, the governor had vetoed three bills. Two of them deal with immigration.
One closes what Republicans have called a “loophole” in a 2024 law requiring sheriffs to comply with ICE “detainer” requests. The other requires state agencies to cooperate with ICE and bars undocumented immigrants from receiving state-funded benefits, among other things.
The ICE detainer bill is unconstitutional, Stein said, as he issued his veto. And the other immigration enforcement bill, he argues, “would … make us less safe.”
Stein also vetoed a bill allowing those over 18 to carry concealed firearms without applying for a permit.
A three-fifths majority vote is required in both the House and Senate to override a veto. Senate Republicans will likely meet that threshold with little difficulty, but the House GOP will have to count votes carefully — they’re one vote short of a supermajority.

Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) previously voted for the ICE detainer bill. If she and every Republican are present, the House can override Stein’s veto.
The math is less favorable on the concealed carry bill, which received two “no” votes from Republicans.
Both chambers can call up override motions at any time when they return for session over the coming months.
What’s fallen short: State budget and shrimping ban
Throughout the final week of session, visitors clad in white t-shirts flooded the hallways of the Legislative Building, and at one point, trucks circled the block honking.
They were business owners and advocates for North Carolina’s coastal shrimping business. And they desperately wanted to kill a bill banning inland shrimp trawling.
Proponents say the bill bans a practice that harms juvenile fish and ruins habitats. The shrimping industry says the bill would be ruinous for their businesses.
On Wednesday afternoon, two of the most vocal Republican opponents to the bill left a private caucus meeting and were greeted with deafening cheers.
The bill was dead, Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort) told the group of advocates. He raised his arms in the air as Sen. Bobby Hanig (R-Dare) embraced one visitor after another.
“God bless America!” one person shouted.

Meanwhile, budget writers in the House and Senate struggled to find any common ground whatsoever.
It had become apparent in the weeks prior that the chambers’ full budget proposals were too far apart to quickly come to an agreement. So in a last-ditch effort, both chambers began fast-tracking what are commonly called “mini-budgets’: slimmed down spending bills that bridge the gap until a full two-year agreement is reached.
The Senate unveiled a bill that funded key economic development projects, enrollment growth for schools, and an array of other items.
The House promptly rejected it, countering with two bills of its own. One of them would have given teachers and state workers raises, while cutting 20% of state jobs (many of them vacant). Those, too, were dead on arrival in the Senate.
Those salary bumps are one of the key sticking points between the House and Senate. But arguably the most important gap revolves around state income taxes. Berger and Senate Republicans are staunchly opposed to changing a series of gradual cuts to the personal rate over the coming years. Hall and House Republicans have said some adjustment is likely necessary to avoid a budget shortfall.
In the meantime, the government will keep running — despite no budget being agreed to by July 1, when the new fiscal year starts. But new projects will stay in limbo, and teachers and state workers won’t see any raises for now.
“Our teachers, law enforcement, and other state employees deserve real pay raises so we can recruit and retain the best,” Stein said in a statement Thursday evening.
“In addition, at a time when the federal government is proposing severe cuts to Medicaid, leaving Raleigh without taking steps to fully fund North Carolina’s Medicaid program is irresponsible. I stand ready to work with the General Assembly to invest in our people and expand opportunities so every person can succeed.”
The final days’ GOP back-and-forth caused some Democrats to voice their exasperation.
“It’s a shame the other house is led by someone who wants to hold it up,” Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said as the House took a vote on their bill to raise salaries for teachers and state workers. “That we had to break it out of the main budget, and broke this way … what a shame.”
Rep. Mitchell Setzer (R-Catawba), presiding over the House, was less moved.
“It’s been done that way since the beginning of time, sir,” he replied.

But far fewer — about 300 when discounting resolutions extending congratulations and condolences, and granting officiants’ wedding rights — survived the six-month session.
Some were killed outright, while others were left to languish in political purgatory known as legislative committee, or without the necessary budget funding to survive. 
On Thursday, we brought you five wins from the legislative session. Now, here are five losses.

1. Gas tax hike not enough to layoffs and service reductions at RIPTA
Cuts are coming soon to the state’s public bus service. That’s even after the General Assembly propped up the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) with nearly $15 million in the fiscal year 2026 budget, including with revenue from a 2-cent increase in the state’s gas tax.
It wasn’t enough to fill what was a $32.6 million shortfall when Gov. Dan McKee released his version of the budget in January. After state lawmakers reduced the deficit to $18 million, RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand said 90 layoffs and a 20% reduction in service may be necessary.
Durand told reporters Thursday afternoon that the deficit was down to $10 million after the agency identified another $8 million in savings from a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan.
When cuts would take effect is still to be determined. The agency plans to hold a series of public hearings on potential service changes starting July 28. But RIPTA already has a guide available — an efficiency study of its operations and financial situation mandated in the state’s fiscal 2025 budget. The governor and legislative leaders wanted the agency to finish the study by March 1, but the board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
The final report is expected to be complete no later than mid-July, Durand told the agency’s board of directors Thursday. Transit advocates said they believed the late efficiency study hurt RIPTA’s chances of getting additional state funds.
“Our hope was that the efficiency study would point out a menu of options for reducing costs before the session ended,” McKee spokesperson Olivia DaRocha said in an email Thursday. “Now, the vendor and RIPTA must continue the work of right-sizing operations to protect taxpayers.”
The efficiency study has been released in phases. A May 30 draft report identified underperforming routes, including the 88 bus, which travels between Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
A June 16 draft memo suggested fare increases and rerouting rural routes to low-income areas, along with “reverse commutes” from Providence to other municipalities.
RIPTA was not without its champions in the General Assembly this year. On the final night of the session, Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, sought to raise an additional $10 million via a floor amendment that would have tapped a bit more into the gas tax and highway funding shares that would normally go toward the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. But the proposal was defeated by a 12-16 vote.

2. Building decarbonization dreams deferred 
Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak beamed after the House of Representatives passed her bill requiring the state to track energy usage from large private and public buildings over 25,000 square feet. Kislak has been trying to set up a state building decarbonization program for four years. 
But her celebration of the June 20 vote was short-lived.
As the hours stretched from night into early morning during the marathon session finale, it became clear the Senate would not take up the legislation, ultimately dooming the measure advocates had viewed as crucial to meeting mandatory state emissions reductions.
The Senate instead passed a resolution asking the state’s Office of Energy Resources to recommend how to begin measuring large building energy use. Lawmakers had received a letter from Chris Kearns, the state’s acting energy commissioner, citing concerns about the bill’s “aggressive” timeline and lack of staff to achieve its mandates.
Deadlines for carbon reductions under the state’s 2021 Act on Climate Law are approaching. The first legally enforceable benchmark calls for cutting emissions 45% from 1990 levels by 2030. Preliminary modeling already suggests the state might miss its 2030 target if it doesn’t take action, including in the building sector, which accounted for nearly half of annual emissions in 2022, the most recent data available.
“We are absolutely ready to do this,” Kislak said in an interview. “We should already be doing this.”
Meanwhile, the city of Providence has laid the framework under a municipal building energy benchmarking program, with an inaugural December 2024 report documenting the energy and emissions usage for 63 city-owned buildings above 10,000 square feet. 
Much like the capital city’s program, Kislak’s bill, having already been revised, doesn’t prescribe target emissions for buildings; instead, it seeks to get a handle on how much energy they use now.
Yet even in her own chamber, lawmakers fretted over the burden on business owners, with 20 representatives — all 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats — voting against the bill.
Kislak acknowledged the bill’s name — “the Building Decarbonization Act of 2025” — might have caused some confusion.
“I should have called it the ‘building energy use measuring bill,’” she said. “That’s what it is, a measuring bill.”

3. Administration v. public records reform 
Advocates for legislation to reform Rhode Island’s Access to Public Record Act, unchanged since 2012, steeled themselves for criticism from McKee’s office. But the force and breadth of opposition — spanning a dozen state agencies, each with multiple points of contention — surprised even Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat and bill sponsor.
“In my 17 years as a lawmaker, I have never seen that many agencies respond to something on their own,” DiPalma said, referring to the letters and testimony to the Senate during an initial May 22 bill hearing. 
The legislation was held by the Senate Committee on Judiciary following the hearing. The House companion never received an initial hearing. 
DiPalma insists McKee’s office orchestrated the takedown, an allegation McKee’s office has not directly addressed in inquiries for comment.
“Transparency is in the public’s interest—that’s not in dispute—but the state must balance transparency with privacy rights and costs to the taxpayer,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office said in an emailed response. 
The 15-page legislation encompassed minor language tweaks and major updates meant to protect and expand access to affordable public information, while integrating new data sources like traffic accidents, police body-worn camera footage and text messages between officials into the definition of public records.
Based on the onslaught of administration criticism, DiPalma had already accepted defeat long before the Rhode Island General Assembly went on recess June 21.
“I’m going to spend my energy and calories where they are needed,” DiPalma said. 
But, he pledged to resuscitate the public records reform bill in the same form next year. Nor was DiPalma willing to meet with McKee’s office to talk over his concerns.
“I am not meeting again to hear them tell me the same thing, ‘no no no,’” he said.
Seconds later, DiPalma added a caveat: “But I am willing to meet with anybody if they are willing to figure out how to make something better.”

4. Universal school meals not on the menu
Lawmakers’ recurring appetite to provide free meals to all Rhode Island schoolchildren went unsatiated yet again in 2025. 
Three bills this year would have provided free breakfast and lunch for every kid attending public school, regardless of their family’s income. All three bills were heard by committees in their respective chambers of origin. And all three bills died before making it to a floor vote, just like last year. (The legislation did pass the Senate in 2023.) 
Rep. Justine Caldwell, an East Greenwich Democrat, led the legislation in the House of Representatives, just like she did last year. Caldwell’s bill was mirrored in the Senate by Sen. Lammis Vargas, a freshman Democrat from Cranston. Also in the Senate was another bill by Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat.Co-sponsored by many of the same senators who signed on to support Vargas’ bill, Acosta’s bill sought to flex more regulatory muscle, with stricter rules around participation for local school districts. 
All three bills would have taken effect on July 1, 2026, and would have phased in universal school meals over three years.   
The push for universal school meals is not unique to Rhode Island and derives from programs adopted during the COVID‑19 pandemic with two years’ worth of federal waivers. As of May 2025, nine states had made this pandemic-era reform permanent by taxation, ballot initiatives, or maneuvers in the budget. 
McKee included $800,000 in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget in January to upgrade approximately 6,500 Rhode Island students from reduced-price meals to gratis ones. 
And as a new legislative session dawned in January 2025, then-Majority Leader Valarie Lawson named school meals as one of her policy priorities this session. Lawson co-sponsored both Senate bills, and in April, the East Providence Democrat became Senate president. 
But even a friend in a high place was not enough to uplift the bill in the chamber.
“The Senate President continues to support this bill and believes that it is a worthwhile investment,” Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, said in an email Thursday. “She will continue to support it when it is re-introduced next year, and will monitor if developments at the federal level impact the program.
Those federal developments could leave a crater-sized impact. The budget outlined in the “Big Beautiful Bill” has free school meal advocates worried that school meal programs could be severely delimited by changes to eligibility requirements.

5. McKee’s priorities forced to take a backseat
Gov. Dan McKee railed against legislative leaders for passing a “bad budget” that included higher taxes and fees he deemed unnecessary and burdensome to working families.
Many of his priorities were also stripped from the final $14.3 billion tax-and-spend plan, or significantly reduced.
Take, for example, the governor’s pledge during the 2024 State of the State address to raise residents’ incomes by $20,000 by 2030. The “Rhode to Prosperity” plan remained merely an outline until a year later, when McKee unveiled his proposed fiscal 2026 budget. The governor wanted to spend $9 million from state coffers and employer taxes to train secondary and higher education students, and the existing workforce, with the goal of boosting their income.
These programs are “crucial” to help residents adapt amid nationwide economic uncertainty, DaRocha, a McKee spokesperson, said in an email.
But lawmakers did not sign on to the funding needed for new apprenticeship programs at the Community College of Rhode Island and expansion of existing training programs through Real Jobs Rhode Island and PrepareRI. 
Initially, the fiscal 2026 budget unveiled by the House Committee on Finance also scrapped any new money for McKee’s signature Learn365 program, though state representatives agreed to add back $1.5 million for the after-school municipal learning program just before approving the spending plan on June 17.
Shekarchi in a June 10 briefing with reporters explained the cuts were necessary because of competing priorities and requests that exceeded available funds.
“What’s obvious was part of the solution was not doing the expenditures that the governor wanted,” said Michael DiBiase, former state administration director who now serves as president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. “That’s how they reached balance.”
Meanwhile, both chambers took another swipe at McKee over his role in steering a 2021 state education contract to the ILO Group, with overwhelming support for a bill banning bid-rigging and penalizing public officials and vendors who flout the rules. McKee has not yet signed the legislation into law, though he indicated at an unrelated press conference Wednesday that his concerns with the bill were addressed.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Jessica Schneider, a member of Chesterfield County’s Board of Supervisors, was about to address a growing crowd of people protesting area immigration raids outside the Chesterfield County Courthouse Wednesday morning when her phone buzzed with news that visibly shook her.
Another immigrant, Salvador Calderon-Cuella — whose immigration status remains unclear at this time — had just been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and quietly whisked away through the courthouse’s back entrance.
Calderon-Cuellar had pleaded guilty in April to two misdemeanor traffic offenses — driving without a license and failing to yield when entering a highway. The fines totaled $130, according to Chesterfield General District Court records. On Wednesday, he arrived at the court to make the payment.
“As we are just here, someone was being taken out the back,” said Schneider, her voice cracking during an interview with The Mercury.

“He had no prior arrests. Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained? This is a person that is here, working in our communities, and why are we punishing him?” Schneider said. 
Since Friday, at least 14 immigrants had been arrested by ICE agents in and around the courthouse, according to reporting by Virginia Scope and other local media outlets. The arrests occurred over the course of several days, many following minor court appearances like Calderon-Cuellar’s. Immigration advocates say some of those arrested had no criminal convictions at all. 
The rash of immigrant arrests in Chesterfield comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has bolstered federal efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants, actions Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares have pledged to support. 
Schneider sees the sweep as part of a broader, politically charged campaign by the president and his allies.
“Trump says he wants to get rid of violent criminals and gang members,” she said in the interview. “But that’s not what’s happening now. This is just all about the cruelty and the racism. To purify our country is what I believe they’re trying to do.”
She grew more emotional as she reflected on her husband’s family history in Germany.
“We’ve been through this. We know what happens when people start to say that we’re better than them, and that we have to get rid of those people. And if we turn a blind eye, look at what happened then,” she said, holding back tears. “We need to stand up for our immigrant friends, neighborhood members and community members.”
 Community and economic toll

The arrests, which are also happening in many other parts of Virginia, come amid growing concern about the ripple effects of stepped-up ICE activity in the state. 
A recent study by the Commonwealth Institute and the Immigration Research Initiative warned that mass detentions of undocumented immigrants not only fracture families but could damage Virginia’s economy.
According to the report, released on Tuesday, undocumented immigrants are central to several key industries. They make up 28% of child care workers, 25% of construction workers, and 25% of cooks. Deporting just 10% of this population would result in a $69 million annual loss in state and local tax revenue — not to mention labor shortages and rising consumer costs, the study found.
“Forcibly removing community members en masse rips the fabric of our communities, erodes trust in law enforcement, and is costly for all of us,” said Freddy Mejia, policy director at the Commonwealth Institute and a co-author of the report.
Shamier Settle, a senior analyst with the Immigration Research Initiative and co-author, warned that deportations don’t only harm undocumented families. 
“Our economy is not a zero-sum game — when immigrants are deported the number of jobs for U.S.-born workers declines.”
 A courthouse, not a ‘sanctuary’

The courthouse arrests have also rattled local officials, even those with no formal oversight of immigration enforcement.
Amanda Pohl, chief clerk of the Chesterfield County Circuit Court, told The Mercury she only learned of the ICE presence after the first arrests occurred. While her office does not control operations in the General District Court — where many of the detentions happened — she immediately began reviewing policy with her staff.
“They’ve been in plain clothes, and so I don’t actually have an accounting of how long they were here, who was here, and how many were here,” she said of the federal agents. “Since I’ve been here, we do not call ICE on anyone, we do not ask for immigration status, and we will continue to implement that practice.”

While Pohl emphasized that her staff does not coordinate with ICE and wants the courthouse to be welcoming for all, she acknowledged the limitations of her authority. 
“We are not able to stop [ICE] if they come to the building,” she said. “But we are going to do our best to make sure that ICE is not in our office and not lurking about.”
Pohl disputed social media rumors that Chesterfield had declared itself a “sanctuary” county — suggesting such misinformation may have drawn ICE’s attention.
“Chesterfield is not a sanctuary county at all,” Pohl said. “But I firmly believe that this is hallowed ground, this is a sacred area. We have to respect the rule of law and due process, and that’s not what’s happening here.”
 Residents rally in response

About three dozen county residents and news media gathered outside the courthouse Wednesday in a protest organized by local civil rights groups and community leaders. Speakers condemned the ICE arrests as inhumane, excessive and a betrayal of democratic ideals. A lone passer-by who yelled out “God bless Donald Trump” was quickly shouted down.
Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, addressed the crowd first.
“Let us be clear, courthouses are sacred places in a democracy,” she said. “When ICE conducts raids in courthouses, we do more than just dispute legal proceedings. We undermine the very foundation of due process.”
Martin warned that courthouse raids don’t only impact immigrants.
“Imagine being a victim of domestic violence, showing up to court to seek a protective order, and instead being detained by ICE. Or think of a key witness in a criminal case who now refuses to testify out of fear of deportation,” she said. “These are not hypothetical situations. They are happening and happening right now.”
Among the speakers was Christian Martinez Lemus, a policy analyst with CASA, a national immigrant advocacy group.
“What we are seeing in the courts, which are supposed to be the places of law and order, is the full erosion of due process and constitutional rights,” Lemus said. “Make no mistake, this is not an issue of illegality. This is an issue of poor people being sent away for political purposes.”
Lemus framed the arrests as part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda driven by Trump-era ideology.
“President Trump’s vision is to wipe out the diversity melting pot this country is known for,” he said. “If ICE agents can wear masks, abduct people in courts, and send them to undisclosed prisons, do you think you are safe? No. We will fight darkness and fear through hope.”
Chesterfield resident Curtis Smith said he attended the protest out of concern for civil liberties.
“What ICE is doing is despicable,” he said. “I shouldn’t be in terror of walking out the courthouse and then wondering if I am going to get dragged off to a detention center because ICE agents saw that I have a Spanish name or something.”
He called the courthouse sweeps a “horrible ambush tactic,” adding that “people should have a chance to go to court without fear of something else that might happen to them when they go to court.”
 Political reactions split

Earlier this week, Youngkin defended the arrests, linking them to a broader law enforcement strategy. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the governor said Virginia’s Homeland Security Task Force had carried out over 2,000 arrests in collaboration with ICE, the FBI, DEA, and state police.
“The fact that there have been some arrests at the Chesterfield County Courthouse makes sense, because they clearly have been arrested, they clearly are here illegally,” Youngkin said. “It’s working. And most importantly, we’re getting really tough bad guys off the street.”
Miyares, whose office played no role in the arrests, nonetheless offered support for the federal operation. 
“These individuals fall into one of two categories: they’re either here illegally and have committed violent felonies, or they’ve already been ordered to be deported by a federal judge,” Miyares said in an email.
But civil rights leaders and Democratic lawmakers expressed alarm.
Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond, released a blistering statement denouncing the courthouse operations as a “rupture in the social covenant” and a violation of constitutional values.
“The courthouse stands as hallowed ground within our constitutional republic — a sanctuary where justice is sought,” Jones said. “When ICE agents transform this space into a site of apprehension, they desecrate the very temple of justice their oath of office obligates them to uphold.”
Jones warned that such enforcement “engenders a climate of fear that permeates entire communities” and proposed several reforms, including designating courthouses as “sensitive locations” where ICE action would be restricted.
“These enforcement tactics do not occur in a historical vacuum,” he said. “They violate basic dignity. Justice without mercy isn’t justice at all — it’s just power masquerading as righteousness.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator is monitoring developments and stressed the importance of transparency. 
“ICE officers should be clearly identifiable to the public as law enforcement to mitigate risk — including risk to themselves if people misunderstand what’s happening,” the spokesperson said.
In the meantime, the full scope of ICE’s presence in Chesterfield and other parts of the state remains unclear. Neither ICE nor the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has responded to The Mercury’s requests for comment.
 Statewide operations

However, the Chesterfield detentions are part of a broader pattern of stepped-up immigration enforcement across Virginia in recent months. 
In Sterling, ICE arrested 10 individuals outside the Northern Virginia Immigration Court earlier this year, prompting similar concerns from advocates about courthouse-related detentions undermining due process. 
In Albemarle County, ICE agents detained two men inside the Albemarle County Courthouse, sparking outrage from local attorneys and activists who said the operation put public safety and legal access at risk.
Additional raids have occurred outside traditional courthouse settings. 
In Northern Virginia, ICE and the FBI jointly detained seven undocumented individuals in what the agency called a “targeted enforcement operation” focused on alleged public safety threats. 
A separate joint operation in Richmond led to the arrest of an undocumented Egyptian national with a prior criminal history, though ICE did not release the individual’s name or further details. 
Overall, federal data cited by Axios indicates Virginia has seen a significant increase in deportation and detention activity in 2025, with the state now among the top 10 nationally for total ICE removals.
Also in Virginia, the Youngkin administration in February launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force (VHSTF) through a partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice and the commonwealth. 
Drawing in more than 200 agents from federal (FBI, ICE, DOJ) and state departments (Virginia State Police, Department of Corrections), the VHSTF was created to blunt transnational organized crime, gang violence, and immigration violations. 
Within two months, it recorded its first milestone — 521 arrests, including 132 individuals with alleged gang affiliations such as MS‑13 and Tren de Aragua — underscoring Youngkin’s description of the initiative as a model “federal-state collaboration” in law enforcement.
Top officials praised the task force’s rapid progress. Youngkin lauded the joint effort as a blueprint for national enforcement efforts, stating that its success “should be replicated all across the country.” 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the operation as evidence of “unprecedented collaboration,” FBI Director Kash Patel called it “a tremendous success,” and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons pointed to the expansion of the 287(g) program — authorized by Executive Order 47 on Feb.  27 and operational within 20 hours — as a key driver of the early results. 
The VHSTF continues to pursue long-term investigations into narcotics trafficking, transnational organized crime, and gang-related activity across Virginia.
Meanwhile, immigration advocates say they are hearing of similar arrests in other parts of the state and are preparing for legal challenges.
Standing outside the courthouse in the aftermath of Wednesday’s protest, Pohl, Chesterfield’s Circuit Court clerk, said as the struggle continues, the nation’s constitutional credence must take precedence.
“We have to respect the rule of law in due process, and that’s not what’s happening here,” she said.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Efforts to redevelop the aging State Center Complex in Baltimore have spanned decades and seen governors and legal battles come and go. Now Gov. Wes Moore (D) wants to try his hand at fixing up the campus.
Moore on Thursday issued a request for proposals on how the state can best transform the aging state-owned complex into a “mixed-use, transit-oriented” development.
“This next chapter for State Center will expand our mission to create jobs, build housing that’s affordable, and create new pathways to work, wages, and wealth in all corners of the state,” Moore said in a written statement on the endeavor.
The 28-acre State Center complex is currently home to several state agencies, including the departments of General Services, Health and Labor.
Due to the decaying conditions at the State Center buildings and the expectation that the property would eventually be redeveloped, thousands of state workers have been moved to offices in other parts of Baltimore in recent years, with the Health Department becoming the latest to join the exodus.
Officials: State Center settlement marks the end of one era and the beginning of another

It’s an involved project, with the departments of General Services and Transportation and the Maryland Economic Development Corp. (MEDCO) all involved in the request for proposals on the property. The agencies hope to land on a consultant this fall, who would spend the next two years on the project.
“The primary goal is to retain a qualified development partner that will implement the redevelopment vision, with a focus on maximizing the economic development and housing potential of the site,” according to the proposals request. “The proposed work schedule estimates a 2.5-year timeline to execute the necessary activities leading to a Master Developer Agreement (MDA) with a potential development partner.”
Talks on redeveloping the campus go back as far as 2005, during the administration of Gov. Bob Ehrlich (R). The Board of Public Works first approved a redevelopment project in 2009, under Gov. Martin O’Malley (D).
That project ultimately fell apart, and then-Gov. Larry Hogan (R) filed a lawsuit in 2016 to terminate the $1.5 billion project. The ex-developer countersued.
Last November, the Moore administration brought an end to the saga by agreeing to pay a $58.5 million settlement, hoping to create a fresh start on development efforts.
When asked during a briefing for reporters Thursday morning, DGS Secretary Atif Chaudhry said that new efforts to revamp the location won’t repeat past mistakes, but will be “more collaborative” and informed than previous attempts.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We’re going from a very structured process – we’re not starting from scratch,” Chaudhry said. “We’re taking older studies that have been done as early as 2024, some dating back to 2018 and before, and we’re looping all those in to make sure that we take all that as an informed process and map out the future that will be in the best interest of the community.”
He said that details such as a timeline for redevelopment and the price-tag for the overhaul project will not be known until they are further along in the consulting process. Part of the consultant’s assessment will include decisions on whether buildings will be reused or demolished, along with other factors that could sway the costs of redevelopment.
State and city officials hope to capitalize on State Center’s proximity to a Metro Subway station and a Light Rail stop in the redevelopment.

“Conveniently located between two transit stations, the State Center Complex is a prime site for transit-oriented development to create a vibrant, dense, walkable community that helps connect Baltimoreans to jobs, affordable housing and opportunities,” Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said in a written statement.
Most of the campus’s buildings were developed in the late ’50s. The Fifth Regiment Armory building, the oldest building in the complex, dates to 1901. The consultant is expected to work with a qualified historic building consultant to assess the armory.
“Today marks a major turning point in how we imagine our State Center Campus,” Chaudhry told reporters, “no longer as an antiquated government complex, but more as the future. To be a walkable, transit-oriented, community-centered place that serves the people of Baltimore and Marylanders.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_statecenter4_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)About 60 Maryland landowners are looking to block a federal district court ruling that said workers for the proposed Piedmont power line could go on private property to survey for the project without the landowners’ permission.
In their appeal Tuesday to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the landowners said the ruling last last week by U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson has “sweeping provisions and consequences” that will affect landowners for the “months or years” it will take Maryland regulators to consider the power line proposal.
Abelson’s injunction should be stayed while the case is on appeal, the landowners asked the 4th Circuit
“This is about protecting our homes, our land, and our constitutional rights,” said a statement from Joanne Frederick, president of the advocacy group Stop MPRP Inc. and one of the sued landowners. “We support the landowners’ decision to appeal, and we urge the courts to halt PSEG’s actions before lasting damage is done.”
The landowners represent about half of the 117 property owners in the path of the proposed power line who were sued in April by PSEG, the project developer, after they refused to let surveyors on their property.
Abelson last Friday agreed with PSEG in an order that said landowners could not deny access to the surveyors as long as the workers posted notice at least 24 hours in advance of their intention to come on site to do the work.
Federal judge grants Piedmont power line company access to land for surveys

The appeal is the latest development of in what is likely the early stages of a legal battle over the proposed 67-mile Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project transmission line, which would stretch from Frederick County to northern Baltimore County, through thousands of acres of largely rural land.
Residents along the line’s proposed path have balked at its impact on their properties and the landscape. They argue that the overall project places an undue burden on Maryland, largely for the benefit of energy-hungry\ data centers in Northern Virginia.
“This appeal gives the courts a chance to restore fairness and rein in overreach,” Frederick said in her statement. “Marylanders should not be forced to surrender their land rights for a project that serves out-of-state corporate interests.”
But officials at PSEG and at PJM — the electric grid operator serving Maryland and 12 other states — say the MPRP is necessary not only because of a surge in demand from data centers, but from rising demand for electrical power generally at a time of declining supply, thanks to the retirement of older coal- and oil-fired power plants.
The Maryland Public Service Commission, which regulates state utilities and power projects, is only just beginning to consider the transmission project, and decide whether to issue a key certification.
In a directive issued Thursday, the PSC cited Abelson’s order allowing surveys to take place, and called for its staff to set a schedule in the case in the next 30 days.
In their appeal, the landowners argued that by getting the preliminary injunction, “PSEG has secured the ultimate relief it sought in this case,” but without all the procedures that would ordinarily take place prior to a final decision.
The injunction was “issued without the benefit of discovery or an evidentiary proceeding during which Respondents could test the factual underpinnings for PSEG’s positions and the Court could weigh the evidence,” read the property owner’s appeal.
Absent a stay in the case, PSEG will likely begin surveying properties, using Abelson’s orders, the residents argued.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If the Fourth Circuit later rules in favor of Respondents, that ruling cannot undo the invasion of Respondents private property rights, which PSEG will infringe under the guise of a preliminary injunction,” the property owners wrote. “The damage will have been done.”
They also worry that PSEG will apply Abelson’s injunction as a justification to enter all of the affected tracts of land along the proposed route of the power line — an additional 292 landowners, according to their appeal.
In assessing PSEG’s application for environmental effects, the Maryland Power Plant Research Program determined that several things were missing, including field studies and information that would show “why route alternatives were rejected, including those with minimal environmental impacts, and why PSEG did not address rebuilding or using existing parallel transmission lines for the project,” the PSC said in a Thursday news release.
“In light of the federal court’s decision affirming PSEG’s right-of-access, the Commission has directed its Staff to facilitate between PSEG and PPRP regarding the time required to produce the field studies and the feasibility of proceeding without them,” read the news release.
The Commission will make the final call on the procedural schedule. The PSC also directed PSEG on Thursday to turn over information about the alternative routes that were not ultimately selected within 30 days.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/federalappealscourt-richmond-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)It could have been called a productive day in the office for the board overseeing the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. But the Accountability and Implementation Board still doesn’t have an office.
After three years of mostly remote work, the board in March approved a 10-year lease on a 3,012-square-foot office on West Street in Annapolis, with hopes of moving the first 10 staffers in this fall.
But AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise told the board at its meeting Thursday that permit and construction delays could push a move-in date off until early next year.
“Once the permits are issued, then obviously the renovation [and] construction on the space will begin,” she said. “It would be great if we could get in there before the end of this current calendar year, but we don’t know how long it will take for the permits to be issued.”
A project summary says it could take 120 days to complete construction and renovations to the office, followed by a final inspection by the Department of General Services before AIB staff can move in.
The board voted unanimously to take $140,000 that had been set aside in this year’s budget for supplies, furniture and other equipment, and shift it into the budget for fiscal 2026, which begins Tuesday.
Maryland Board of Education approves agreement to clarify roles on Blueprint reform plan

Office or no, the board had a productive day Thursday, welcoming new staff, saying farewell to some board members, finalizing an agreement with the state Board of Education and broadening a contract for an outside assessment of the Blueprint’s progress.
Taking a closer look at career counseling
The contract originally called for the nonpartisan research organization NORC, at the University of Chicago, to conduct an interim evaluation on the overall 10-year Blueprint reform plan and report back to the board by Dec. 1, 2026. The board in January approved a $766,709 contract, out of a $1 million allocation, for the contract.
The board Thursday voted unanaimously to appropriate most of the rest of that $1 million, increasing the contract with NORC by as much as $223,209 because of new state requirements for the scope of the study.
The expanded contract requires a review of the career counseling program for middle and high school students. The additional work was mandated as part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act that takes effect July 1, tweaking parts of the Blueprint.
That will include assessing whether counseling services are preparing students for post college and career readiness pathways, determining the percentage of students who completed a career readiness assessment and the number applying to postsecondary education, training programs or registered apprenticeship programs.
For high school students, NORC will also review long-term metrics such as how many students were employed in a field of interest or related industry within a year of graduation, and the number of students who may be unemployed or not participating in a postsecondary education program.
A report on the effectiveness of the career counseling program must be submitted to the governor and General Assembly by Jan. 1, 2027.
The board also voted unanimously to give final approval to a memorandum of understanding with the state Board of Education, clarifying roles and responsibilities of the two organzations on the implementation of the Blueprint plan.

The Board of Education approved the memo Tuesday. It comes three years into the Blueprint’s implementation, following years of constant frustration from local school systems who were never sure which board was in charge of what parts of the plan.
Staff hellos, board goodbyes
The board introduced three more full-time employees who started Wednesday — one day after Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a state hiring freeze would take effect next week, part of a package of measures aimed at trimming $121 million in personnel costs from the fiscal 2026 budget.
Hise said board staff are still determining how the hiring freeze might affect the Blueprint board. Meanwhile, she said, staff are still looking to hire a policy analyst for the Blueprint’s college and career readiness priority, along with two administrative positions. The AIB also has two contractual employees.
“We’re still working through the details of that [hiring freeze] and the impact, but we’re hopeful that we will be able to still get fully staffed in the next few months,” she said. “We will talk more about that next month, as we move into the [new] fiscal year. At this time, we feel like it’s manageable.”
The employees who started Wednesday are Alex Baum, who worked with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ preschool program and will be a policy analyst focused on early childhood education — the first of five “pillars” in the Blueprint.
Liz Smith and Simone Hall come from District of Columbia Public Schools, where Smith handled strategic planning and Hall was a liaison to the District on school budgeting. Smith joins AIB as a policy analyst on governance and accountability, and Hall will work as a financial analyst.
Before the 2 1/2-hour meeting ended, two board members received a virtual “thank you” to Mara Doss and Laura Stapleton, whose final meeting was Thursday.

Stapleton’s term expires Tuesday, but she chose not to reapply. She chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park.
Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, plans to resign Monday, with a year left on her six-year term.
Both had been on the board since its first-ever meeting in November 2021.
“It is important for you to know how much I appreciate your time and your efforts,” said board chair Isiah “Ike” Leggett. “I think that you will be very proud of what you’ve done, what you’ve accomplished, not only for the individual student, but the state of Maryland.”
Board member Joseph Manko, an education program officer at the Abell Foundation, also has a term that expires Tuesday, but he has applied for reappointment for a second term.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As the federal government considers transitioning from using a funding formula to dole out money to public schools nationwide to providing block grants instead, the proposition is stirring debate among Virginia lawmakers and education leaders. A House of Delegates committee and school leaders convened last week to talk about the possible shift in education funding and the continued impacts of federal funding cuts statewide.
Supporters of block grants, or large sums of federal funding, argue that they would give states more flexibility to address individual issues. Critics, meanwhile, are concerned about whether the block grants would be appropriately and equitably distributed, including to English learners and at-risk students from low-income families.
The grants could also help school divisions know months earlier in the state budget process how much federal funding they will receive.
Suffolk Public Schools Superintendent John Gordon III said after the meeting that if the federal government switches to the block grant concept, Virginia lawmakers and education leaders need to create an action plan for implementation in schools here, including webinars and presentations for all school divisions facing massive federal funding cuts.
“What I do like about the idea of a block grant is that it would give school divisions some flexibility, but there’s also going to need to be some parameters on specifically what the grant can be used for,” Gordon said in an interview following the meeting.
Gordon, along with other division leaders from Cumberland County and Newport News Public Schools, spoke last Friday to the House committee studying the impacts of the federal workforce and funding reductions at their meeting on the campus of Norfolk State University. 
In February, the committee was established as Virginia braces for broader effects on its federal workforce and potential funding reductions. These changes are a response to executive order by President Donald Trump and his administration’s actions aimed at eliminating what they consider “wasteful” government spending.

Friday’s discussion broached impacts to Virginia’s coastal resiliency efforts, emergency management programs, rental assistance programs and tariffs on port operations. 
The discussion on the impact on state and local K-12 funding rounded out the meeting.
According to the state superintendent’s report for the 2023-24 school year, Virginia schools received $2.4 billion in federal funds.
Dr. Denelle Wallace Alexander, dean of Norfolk State University’s School of Education, said that while state and local funding make up most of the funding for public schools, federal funding also plays a crucial role in maintaining programs and staffing, providing resources, and supporting vulnerable populations. To put the funding in perspective, state and local funds comprised about 75% of total funding during the 2023-24 school year. Federal funds make up 10%, with the rest being loans and bonds. 
Wallace Alexander also said two university programs, in particular, have been impacted, which have helped increase the pipeline for school counselors and teachers.
“Our support for education must be paramount because we know that education is the foundation for everything else,” she said. “We must educate in order to stay ahead. We must educate to stay innovative, and we must educate to make sure that the health of the commonwealth of Virginia continues to stay strong because its citizens are well educated and they are able to take us beyond the 21st Century.”
Superintendents Chip Jones, formerly from Cumberland Schools, Michelle Mitchell from Newport News, and Gordon also shared with lawmakers grim details of how the changes in Washington could impact their respective school divisions.


 Appeals for relief funds

The meeting also comes as the Virginia Department of Education and several school divisions wait for the U.S. Department to decide whether to release schools’ relief funds back to them. The deadline to spend all allocated funds was abruptly moved to March 28 of this year; the original deadline had been set for March 2026, leaving schools scrambling to make plans for the money. VDOE is seeking $8 million and the school divisions are in line for $25 million.


In Suffolk, Gordon said the school division is facing a $11.3 million loss, impacting 100 positions that provide services to socioeconomically challenged families and students, as well as 15% of students in special education and the JROTC program, which serves 400 students.
Cumberland schools also face a $1.7 million reduction, with special education, after-school programs and career and technical education taking a hit.
“The majority of my federal funding funds people,” Jones said, adding that “people are where you cut … and it’s very hard to sit across from someone and tell them you’re losing your job.”
In Newport News, Mitchell said an area of concern for the school division is the impact of furloughed employees at the shipyard.
“While that’s not directly related to the federal cuts, it adds to the economic concerns because the shipyard is our largest employer in our school division,” Mitchell said. “So the federal cuts, in general, impact the city, which, in turn, of course, impacts the city’s ability to support our schools.”
Newport News is expected to face a loss of $700,000 for an adult education program and grants for English Language Learners, Mitchell said.
Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, the committee chair, described the changes as a “double whammy” for lawmakers, as they will try to balance the prospect of fully funding public schools while also managing other areas impacted by cuts.
Lawmakers have worked to address the lack of state funding for schools, most notably after researchers for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, found that the state had been underfunding schools since the Great Recession started in 2007.
The committee has a meeting scheduled for Aug. 14 at the General Assembly Building.
“We are very cognizant that these cuts are going to affect our local school districts,” Bulova said. “We’re just getting our arms around what the order of magnitude of those cuts will be and so we’ve got to make sure that we don’t set back public education after we have worked really hard over the last couple years, based on the JLARC report, to be able to catch up with K-12 education.”

Shuttered Norfolk brewery at center of ‘woke mob’ controversy needs nearly $2 million in 20 days

The company’s board has been gutted with only Alan Beal, the chief executive officer, still present after closing its Norfolk brewery in early March. In recent emails to potential investors, Beal said he is pressing on, looking for a new home in Texas or Florida and negotiating with a contract brewer despite not raising the capital he said the company needed to continue. 
Beal told investors in April that the company needed to raise seven figures by the end of the month. 
He pledged that if the company did not raise at least $1.7 million by April 29 — or raised less and could not negotiate payment plans — that it would refund the new investments.
“If we fall short of this goal, we will likely be forced to completely reorganize the company, or even terminate operations,” he wrote in an April 14 fundraising email. “And remember, all funds are going to be held in escrow until we know we have raised sufficient funds to pay off or restructure the existing debt, and to relocate and to move forward with the new business plan.” 
That campaign raised only $268,000, according to an email from Beal. Some of that paid former employees, a claim confirmed by one former staffer.

In email after email since April, Beal has blamed the company’s failure on a “woke mob” that spoke out after the Armed Forces July 2023 purchase of the former O’Connor Brewing for $3 million. Opponents pointed to social media posts by Robert O’Neill, Armed Forces’ former brand ambassador, board member, and the SEAL Team 6 member who claims to have killed Osama bin Laden, as offensive and reason not to support the company. O’Neill’s social media posts criticized the Navy for using a drag queen in a recruitment ad and mocked transgender people. 
But former employees laid the company’s problems on Beal. Interviews with nine former employees and contractors for Armed Forces said the Norfolk taproom did not reach its revenue potential partly because of the controversy. Armed Forces suffered setbacks selling beer, notably losing market share after failing last year to pay Brew Hub, a Florida contract brewery it had been using since before the Norfolk purchase.
“The closing of AFBC had nothing to do with a “woke mob,” former mid-Atlantic sales manager Tim Labbe wrote on Facebook in March, saying he was part of a team growing sales in seven states. “We had great relationships with the major chain grocery stores in those states as well as big distributors. When Alan (Beal) stopped paying bills and stopped complying with the agreements in place that all dried up.”
Prior to the latest request for funders, the company raised about $8.5 million from more than 10,000 investors who contributed a minimum of $200. They were supposed to get rewards ranging from stickers to hats, but an April Securities and Exchange filing said the company may not be able to fulfill that promise. Armed Forces suffered a net loss of $1.76 million for the first six months of 2024. The company has failed to file its annual 2024 financial report to the SEC. 
The majority of cash from investors over two years covered operating losses.
Armed Forces and Ironbound, which owns the property on 24th Street, remain in arrears on other bills. The city’s website shows that Armed Forces has unpaid property, food, and beverage taxes for 2025, but does not reveal the amount. Ironbound AFBC, which owns the brewery, owes $13,500 in real estate taxes dating back to December. 
A city spokesman said the amount of the food, beverage, and property taxes owed is exempt from Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act. The city has padlocked the building with “a large amount of beer on the premises and in the tanks,” according to an April SEC filing. That means the company has no way to generate revenue fulfilling orders to distributors.

The SEC filing also reveals Armed Forces has liens against it for construction costs totaling nearly $110,000 and has been sued in Norfolk by two former employees for $15,800 over unpaid salaries. A filing by a lawyer from Oliveri & Larsen, a debt collection firm, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, seeks to recover a “large claim” owed Barnes Beverage Group, a consulting firm. A lawyer for the firm declined to comment. Armed Forces has also been threatened with lawsuits for failing to pay three lenders a total of more than $335,000, according to the filing. Beal personally guaranteed two of those loans totaling nearly $250,000. 
The three loans are in default and the filing says, “there is great uncertainty as to whether the Company will be able to pay off or pay down the loan.”
Beal has continued making promotional appearances on sympathetic, small-audience media, showing up on Real American Blue, a streaming webcast hosted by Robert “Curly” Flanagan, a retired Arizona Maricopa County sheriff and a forthcoming FloBilly Swamp Wear episode filmed in Florida.

The long-term health care industry is facing a double whammy from President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants and the GOP’s proposals to reduce Medicaid spending. The industry is highly dependent on foreign workers: More than 800,000 immigrants and naturalized citizens comprise 28% of direct care employees at home care agencies, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care companies.
But in January, the Trump administration rescinded former President Joe Biden’s 2021 policy that protected health care facilities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The administration’s broad immigration crackdown threatens to drastically reduce the number of current and future workers for the industry. “People may be here on a green card, and they are afraid ICE is going to show up,” said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofits that care for older adults.
Existing staffing shortages and quality-of-care problems would be compounded by other policies pushed by Trump and the Republican-led Congress, according to nursing home officials, resident advocates, and academic experts. Federal spending cuts under negotiation may strip nursing homes of some of their largest revenue sources by limiting ways states leverage Medicaid money and making it harder for new nursing home residents to retroactively qualify for Medicaid. Care for 6 in 10 residents is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health program for poor or disabled Americans.
“We are facing the collision of two policies here that could further erode staffing in nursing homes and present health outcome challenges,” said Eric Roberts, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

The industry hasn’t recovered from covid-19, which killed more than 200,000 long-term care facility residents and workers and led to massive staff attrition and turnover. Nursing homes have struggled to replace licensed nurses, who can find better-paying jobs at hospitals and doctors’ offices, as well as nursing assistants, who can earn more working at big-box stores or fast-food joints. Quality issues that preceded the pandemic have expanded: The percentage of nursing homes that federal health inspectors cited for putting residents in jeopardy of immediate harm or death has risen alarmingly from 17% in 2015 to 28% in 2024.
In addition to seeking to reduce Medicaid spending, congressional Republicans have proposed shelving the biggest nursing home reform in decades: a Biden-era rule mandating minimum staffing levels that would require most of the nation’s nearly 15,000 nursing homes to hire more workers.
The long-term care industry expects demand for direct care workers to burgeon with an influx of aging baby boomers needing professional care. The Census Bureau has projected the number of people 65 and older would grow from 63 million this year to 82 million in 2050.

In an email, Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency “is committed to supporting a strong, stable long-term care workforce” and “continues to work with states and providers to ensure quality care for older adults and individuals with disabilities.” In a separate email, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said foreigners wanting to work as caregivers “need to do that by coming here the legal way” but did not address the effect on the long-term care workforce of deportations of classes of authorized immigrants.
Goodwin Living, a faith-based nonprofit, runs three retirement communities in northern Virginia for people who live independently, need a little assistance each day, have memory issues, or require the availability of around-the-clock nurses. It also operates a retirement community in Washington, D.C. Medicare rates Goodwin House Alexandria as one of the best-staffed nursing homes in the country. Forty percent of the organization’s 1,450 employees are foreign-born and are either seeking citizenship or are already naturalized, according to Lindsay Hutter, a Goodwin spokesperson.
“As an employer, we see they stay on with us, they have longer tenure, they are more committed to the organization,” said Rob Liebreich, Goodwin’s president and CEO.
Jackline Conteh spent much of her youth shuttling between Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana to avoid wars and tribal conflicts. Her mother was killed by a stray bullet in her home country of Liberia, Conteh said. “She was sitting outside,” Conteh, 56, recalled in an interview.

Conteh was working as a nurse in a hospital in Sierra Leone in 2009 when she learned of a lottery for visas to come to the United States. She won, though she couldn’t afford to bring her husband and two children along at the time. After she got a nursing assistant certification, Goodwin hired her in 2012.
Conteh said taking care of elders is embedded in the culture of African families. When she was 9, she helped feed and dress her grandmother, a job that rotated among her and her sisters. She washed her father when he was dying of prostate cancer. Her husband joined her in the United States in 2017; she cares for him because he has heart failure.
“Nearly every one of us from Africa, we know how to care for older adults,” she said.
Her daughter is now in the United States, while her son is still in Africa. Conteh said she sends money to him, her mother-in-law, and one of her sisters.
In the nursing home where Goodness and 89 other residents live, Conteh helps with daily tasks like dressing and eating, checks residents’ skin for signs of swelling or sores, and tries to help them avoid falling or getting disoriented. Of 102 employees in the building, broken up into eight residential wings called “small houses” and a wing for memory care, at least 72 were born abroad, Hutter said.
Donald Goodness grew up in Rochester, New York, and spent 25 years as rector of The Church of the Ascension in New York City, retiring in 1997. He and his late wife moved to Alexandria to be closer to their daughter, and in 2011 they moved into independent living at the Goodwin House. In 2023 he moved into one of the skilled nursing small houses, where Conteh started caring for him.
“I have a bad leg and I can’t stand on it very much, or I’d fall over,” he said. “She’s in there at 7:30 in the morning, and she helps me bathe.” Goodness said Conteh is exacting about cleanliness and will tell the housekeepers if his room is not kept properly.
  Grooming Goodness is one of Conteh’s daily tasks. (Photo by Alyssa Schukar for KFF Health News)
Conteh said Goodness was withdrawn when he first arrived. “He don’t want to come out, he want to eat in his room,” she said. “He don’t want to be with the other people in the dining room, so I start making friends with him.”
She showed him a photo of Sierra Leone on her phone and told him of the weather there. He told her about his work at the church and how his wife did laundry for the choir. The breakthrough, she said, came one day when he agreed to lunch with her in the dining room. Long out of his shell, Goodness now sits on the community’s resident council and enjoys distributing the mail to other residents on his floor.
“The people that work in my building become so important to us,” Goodness said.
While Trump’s 2024 election campaign focused on foreigners here without authorization, his administration has broadened to target those legally here, including refugees who fled countries beset by wars or natural disasters. This month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the work permits for migrants and refugees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who arrived under a Biden-era program.
“I’ve just spent my morning firing good, honest people because the federal government told us that we had to,” Rachel Blumberg, president of the Toby & Leon Cooperman Sinai Residences of Boca Raton, a Florida retirement community, said in a video posted on LinkedIn. “I am so sick of people saying that we are deporting people because they are criminals. Let me tell you, they are not all criminals.”
At Goodwin House, Conteh is fearful for her fellow immigrants. Foreign workers at Goodwin rarely talk about their backgrounds. “They’re scared,” she said. “Nobody trusts anybody.” Her neighbors in her apartment complex fled the U.S. in December and returned to Sierra Leone after Trump won the election, leaving their children with relatives.
“If all these people leave the United States, they go back to Africa or to their various countries, what will become of our residents?” Conteh asked. “What will become of our old people that we’re taking care of?”

Image: Legal Aid NCThe North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill that would impose a freeze on the use of a major legal aid fund for anything other than administrative fees Thursday. The measure would place a hold on millions of dollars used for public assistance until 2026.
The provision, included in three bills that passed the House Wednesday, was approved by the Senate on Thursday as part of Senate Bill 429, the “2025 Public Safety Act.” It stipulates that no money from the North Carolina Interest on Lawyers’ Trust Accounts (IOLTA) fund, established in 1983 to fund legal aid throughout the state, may be used to issue grants or other public assistance programs.
IOLTA operates by pooling funds that lawyers are required to hold in trust so that they may collectively generate interest, which is used to fund aid programs for individuals who cannot otherwise afford legal assistance. Since its inception, IOLTA has awarded $134 million in grants supporting these efforts, helping in areas such as education, healthcare access, and housing.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) moved to remove the IOLTA restrictions from all three bills Wednesday, noting a lack of relevance to the subject matter of the bills. The IOLTA provision was added to all three bills the day prior to their vote on the House floor.
“This is private money that accrues interest on lawyers’ trust accounts, and what this amendment will do, it will freeze it,” Morey said. “All the grants that could be started in 2026 will be frozen. All of you in your districts benefit from many of the grants that the State Bar puts out.”
She cited the importance of grants for victims’ compensation, elder law, and foreclosure prevention, as well as numerous other civil matters. “On January 1, there will be no money coming into these organizations that have been helping people in civil matters.”
Though the Senate rejected two other bills containing the provision Thursday, it ultimately passed the Public Safety Act, which includes the IOLTA freeze alongside dozens of noncontroversial changes to criminal procedure, such as increased penalties for soliciting minors, greater access to protective orders for victims of domestic violence, and creating new criminal offenses for habitual domestic violence and exposing children to controlled substances.
The bill heads to Governor Josh Stein’s desk for his decision on whether to approve or veto it. Should it become law, IOLTA funds will be frozen from July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2026. Grants issued in 2025 would still be paid out, but none could be issued in 2026.
In a January press release, IOLTA announced it would disburse roughly $12 million in grants in 2025, including $5,325,000 to Legal Aid of North Carolina, $1,160,000 to Pisgah Legal Services,
$1,070,000 to the North Carolina Justice Center. Smaller grants were allocated to groups like the Home Defense Project, Disability Rights North Carolina, and the Council for Children’s Rights.
The funds have also proved invaluable in the past in funding legal aid services to people impacted by natural disasters, with $970,000 being issued in 2024 for legal aid to victims of Hurricane Helene, that went toward helping indigent North Carolinians navigate insurance claims and evade consumer fraud attempts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Legal-Aid-NC-logo-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

Between new rounds of redistricting and even more restrictive voting legislation, Republican state lawmakers seem poised to engineer an easier path for their party’s candidates, they say.
“I think Ohio has become something of a test subject state for seeing just how far a super majority can chip away at access to the ballot and our rights to direct democracy,” Kelley Dufour from Common Cause Ohio said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With Republicans notching several wins in 2024, the “sensationalized” version of voter restriction rhetoric has taken something of a back seat, Dufour said.
“But forces are still working behind the scenes, right? At an administrative death by 1,000 cuts,” she said. “It’s a quieter process, but it’s significantly harmful to voters.”
One example is a sharp uptick in provisional voting.
In 2024, Dufour explained, 34,000 had to vote provisionally — roughly 40% more than in the last presidential election.
Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers are considering new measures that would require proof of citizenship to register and open the door to challenging a voters’ citizenship status on Election Day itself.
Proof of citizenship would require voters gathering birth certificates, divorce records, name-change records, or other paperwork.
This has already presented difficulties, for instance, for some trying to obtain a National I.D. card for air travel.
How it plays out on the map
But the “cherry on top,” Dufour said, is redistricting. Ohio could see a major shakeup to its congressional map ahead of next year’s midterms because lawmakers here are legally required to draft a new map.
Right now, Ohio has 15 districts with five represented by Democrats and 10 represented by Republicans, or 33% to 66%.
Ohio U.S. Congressional redistricting is on the agenda for 2025, with advocates preparing

Midterm elections typically serve as a kind of referendum on a new presidential administration. Historically it has not been kind to the president’s party. That’s particularly concerning in the U.S. House, where Republicans are clinging to a thin 220-2012 majority.
Redistricting in GOP-controlled states like Ohio and Texas could turn that vulnerability into an advantage.
Common Cause Texas Executive Director Anthony Gutierrez explained, in his state, the governor has already announced a special session in July.
The governor hasn’t shared what will be on the agenda, but at a recent press conference the state’s lieutenant governor was enthusiastic about the idea.
“He was asked about redistricting, and he said that he does think that if there’s any opportunity for Republicans in Texas to pick up some seats, that he does think that they should do it,” Gutierrez said, “So, nothing confirmed, but senior Republicans who probably have some insight into what’s going on, have been giving indications that they do think this is going to happen.”
In Ohio, lawmakers have to come up with a new map because the last one was approved along party lines.
The General Assembly has until the end of September to come up with a map but has shown little inclination to do so thus far. If lawmakers don’t act, that would put the task back in the hands of the seven-member Ohio Redistricting Commission.
“Currently, we have five Democrats and 10 Republicans that Ohio sends to D.C.,” Dufour said. “The map-making process could eliminate a few Democratic-leaning districts.”
What that might look like in Ohio
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno is eager to see it happen. Moreno told Punchbowl News he thinks the GOP will pick up two additional seats and that Republicans controlling 12 of 15 districts — 80% of the delegation — “reflects the state.”
Moreno reasoned there’s “a recognition” that big cities like Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland will be represented by Democrats.
Moreno won his statewide race with just 50.09% of the vote, a far cry from the 80% share he thinks Republicans should control in the U.S. House. In addition to losing the three Cs, Moreno lost counties anchored by Toledo, Akron, Dayton, and Athens.
Sitting in the crosshairs of Ohio’s redistricting effort are Ohio Democratic U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes. Kaptur’s Toledo-area district and Sykes’ Akron-based seat are the two most closely divided districts in the state.
Both lawmakers have drawn familiar challengers. Republican former State Rep. Derek Merrin has joined a crowded primary field for a rematch against Kaptur. State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., has thrown his hat in the ring, too.
In Sykes’ district, her 2024 opponent, Republican former state Rep. Kevin Coughlin, is running to face her again, as well.
In both contests, even minor tweaks to the map could have a significant impact on the outcome. Sykes only beat Coughlin by about two points. Kaptur’s margin was even tighter. She beat Merrin by just 2,382 votes — less than a percentage point.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.











I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert



The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.











We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey



Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Estimates show $190M more revenue, right after budget is adopted",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/ct-budget-legislative-session/,"Once again, Gov. Ned Lamont's administration found a big pile of money shortly after lawmakers closed the regular legislative session.","Once again, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration has identified a big pile of money, almost $190 million, shortly after legislators have adopted a new budget and closed their regular legislative session.
Leaders who’ve already watered down new investments in health care and special education while scrapping income tax relief for middle class families are getting frustrated.
Over the past seven years, Lamont’s budget office has upgraded revenue estimates an average of $285 million in the first 2 ½ months after lawmakers leave the Capitol.
In other words, there’s often considerably more money available than projected. And leaders from both parties this week said it’s time to reevaluate Connecticut’s forecasting process.
“It’s occurring year after year, said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. It’s a pattern now.”
Connecticut lawmakers can’t invest in new programs, cut taxes or otherwise craft a new state budget without knowing what’s available to spend. But their most crucial forecast — delivered just 15 days after the mid-April income tax filing deadline — has being viewed by some as unreliable.
Gilchrest: ‘We need to have an honest conversation’
The $285 million average variance between what Lamont’s analysts reported in late April of the past seven years and what they projected by mid-July is more than three times the $92 million average gap lawmakers dealt with between 2011 and 2018 under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, according to state budget records.
The coronavirus pandemic may have inflated Lamont’s numbers somewhat. The traditional April 15 income tax filing deadline was pushed to July 15 in 2020 and to May 15 in 2021, severely limiting data for analysts to use in projections.
But even after excluding those two years, the average gap during Lamont’s tenure is almost $200 million.
And sometimes, legislators say, the timing on these changing projections is particularly hard to swallow.
The administration increased this year’s tax receipts estimate by $188 million on June 20, 16 days after the regular 2025 session ended and 18 days after lawmakers adopted a new state budget, which Lamont hadn’t even signed into law by Thursday night.
Surging revenues just before the fiscal year closes on June 30 typically translates into extra revenue in the next year or two.
“Had we been aware of the likelihood of that money,” Looney added, “clearly there would have been advocacy to fund some of our priorities at a higher level.”
Majority Democrats, already frustrated by budget controls that save aggressively at the expense of core programs, watered down several big initiatives. Administration officials note budget caps might have blocked more spending anyway, but lawmakers used several accounting maneuvers to work around those, often collaborating on them with the governor.
An Appropriations Committee proposal to add $84 million for special education grants next fiscal year became just $30 million, well below what local school districts need to meet rising costs.
Hopes for a new $600-per-child state income tax credit aimed at hundreds of thousands of households eventually became a flat $250 payment — and only to families making about $67,000 per year or less. It would distribute about 1/8th of the projected $300 million cost for a full child tax credit.
“When we find money like this, after the budget is done but before the end of the new fiscal year, it’s going to raise concerns among my members,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said of the administration’s new projections.
“We need to have an honest conversation about Connecticut’s revenue and our budget,” said Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, who watched in disappointment as 80% of a planned $75 million increase in long-neglected Medicaid rates for doctors who treat the poor vanished from the first year of the new budget.
“People pay their taxes so that government can support them when they need that” help, Gilchrest said. “It’s just very frustrating.”
And with Congress and President Donald Trump debating massive cuts in state assistance for Medicaid and other human services programs, Connecticut can’t miss opportunities to bolster its safety net because of outdated revenue projections, said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of the progressive grassroots coalition Connecticut For All.
“This money needs to immediately be invested in many programs our communities are crying out for — housing, health care, education — to safeguard us from Trump’s cuts,” she said.
Republican leaders, who often are hoping for a revenue surge to finance tax relief, were equally annoyed.
The House and Senate minority leaders, Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford and Stephen Harding of Brookfield, said unsuccessful GOP efforts to block tax hikes on corporations would have been aided by the knowledge that revenues already were on the rise.
Under the new budget, corporations will pay an extra $213 million in taxes over the next two years combined due to changes in income reporting and other rules. And a corporate tax surcharge that was supposed to expire would be extended to 2028, raising another $128 million over the coming biennium.
“I think that this budgeting process has now become political rather than policy-oriented,” Candelora said, adding he fears Democratic efforts to circumvent budget caps have prompted Lamont to become hyper-conservative when projecting revenue.
“I think a siting governor has joined that chorus and is trying to outmaneuver the legislature,” Candelora said.
The Lamont administration irked many legislators earlier this year when the Connecticut Mirror disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars in interest earnings on federal COVID grants, dating back to 2021, weren’t deposited into the General Fund until January 2025.
The governor’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, said it stemmed from a misunderstanding with the treasurer’s office.
GOP lawmakers were frustrated in June 2022 when they pitched a plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in income, fuel and transportation taxes but were blocked by Lamont and Democrats, in part by arguments that revenues wouldn’t support the cuts.
By mid-July 2022, the administration identified an extra $568 million in tax revenues.
“I always believe in transparency,” Harding said. “I know the governor says he believes in transparency. … There’s something that’s not adding up.”
Revenue forecasting isn’t an exact science
But the Lamont administration noted that revenue forecasting is hardly an exact science, and receipts from the income tax — which generates more than $11 billion annually or roughly half of the resources for the General Fund — can vary significantly in a short period of time.
“These are estimates, and there has been significant international macroeconomic uncertainty over the past several years, including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and wars,” said Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee.
And given how much the income tax generates, he added, a variance of $285 million isn’t unusual.
The legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis recently confirmed revenue growth like what Lamont’s staff reported on June 20. 
Analysts for the governor and the General Assembly, working largely off data provided by the Executive Branch, jointly prepare an April 30 report, projecting revenues for the current fiscal year and the next three. Legislators chiefly rely on this forecast to craft new budgets and make any final adjustments to the outgoing one.
But many years that work isn’t finished until early June. And by then, the revenue numbers often seem to change.
Legislative leaders didn’t accuse the Lamont administration of intentionally withholding data on revenue growth, but they did say it’s time to revisit the process and ensure lawmakers have more up-to-date information before they make decisions.
Connecticut’s legislature meets for roughly three months, from early February to early May, in even-numbered years. But during the longer sessions, which run from early January to early June, legislators could receive an updated revenue projection entering the final week or two, Looney said.
“I think we need to find a way to adjust the calendar to gather as much information as we can,” he said.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, noted legislators imposed new reporting mandates this spring to better anticipate growth in program costs. 
A natural next step, she said, is better estimates on the revenues that can support new investments or finance additional tax relief.
“Obviously, as you negotiate a budget,” Ritter added, “this is pretty critical information to have.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

Tax policy can be maddeningly complex and confusing. Indeed, keeping it that way is one tool the super-rich use to avoid paying their fair share.
As Alexandra Sirota of the nonpartisan North Carolina Budget and Tax Center recently observed, however, it doesn’t have to be that way.
As she notes, there’s a simple and commonsense solution that would dramatically improve our state’s regressive tax system and raise close to a billion dollars per year – a millionaire’s tax.
By raising the state personal income tax rate on annual incomes over a million dollars to seven percent – a rate that would still be lower than what millionaires paid as recently as 2013 – North Carolina would realize an annual boost in state revenue of around $980 million. That would be enough to help insulate the state from the massive cuts in federal dollars that are about to be enacted in Washington.
The bottom line: Right now, North Carolina taxes people of fabulous wealth and those living in poverty at the exact same rate. A simple millionaire’s tax would do much to cure this grave inequity.

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine, and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months, or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states, including New Hampshire, have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork, or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases, and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when, and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Compromise budget language hashed out this week by an Ohio House-Senate committee will make problems hurting Ohio pharmacies infinitely worse, the leader of a group that represents them said Thursday.
He added that the Ohio Chamber of Commerce — which advocated part of the legislation — seemed blind to the effect it would have on member businesses by making it more difficult for employees to access medicine.
As it works against a June 30 budget deadline, a House-Senate conference committee approved an amendment that keeps part of a bill meant to help ailing pharmacies but slashes another. 
The result, said Dave Burke, a pharmacist, former state senator, and executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, will be that pharmacies will go from earning scant profits to none at all.
“It’s any pharmacist’s suicide bill,” he said Thursday.
Ohio pharmacies have been in trouble for years. 
They’ve complained of high fees and low reimbursements from huge middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Last year, Ohio lost 215 pharmacies and their total number dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory, according to an online tracker launched by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. 
As pharmacies disappear, they create a lack of access that is particularly hard on the poor, elderly and disabled. Not only do they get their medicine at what are often main-street businesses. They also get professional medical advice about chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.
PBMs, the middlemen, decide which drugs are covered, and they use a non-transparent system to decide how much to reimburse pharmacies that dispense them. The three biggest control nearly 80% of the marketplace.
As pharmacies close, Ohio Chamber blasted for siding with middlemen

Each of those companies is part of a Fortune 15 health conglomerate that also owns a top-10 health insurer. CVS owns the largest retail pharmacy chain and all three own mail-order pharmacies.
So, when the big PBMs decide reimbursements, impose rules and charge fees, they’re doing so for their own pharmacies and their competitors. That’s a glaring conflict of interest, their critics say.
There have been abuses in Ohio. In 2018, the Ohio Department of Medicaid peeled back the curtain and learned that a year earlier CVS and UnitedHealth’s PBM, OptumRx, charged taxpayers $224 million more for drugs than they paid the pharmacies that had dispensed them. The Medicaid department fired the PBMs. 
In 2022 it got rid of their hidden, seemingly arbitrary system of reimbursement in which the same companies sometimes pay 500 different prices for the same drug. Instead, prices are determined by a public survey published by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — the National Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC. 
With pharmacies no longer losing money on some drugs and making it on others, the Medicaid department set a $10 per-prescription dispensing fee to cover pharmacies’ overhead. Even with the increased dispensing fees, an analysis said the state saved $140 million from the reforms.
Ohio state Rep. Tim Barhorst, R-Fort Laramie, this year proposed to use the same arrangement in many non-Medicaid transactions. That measure made it into the Ohio House budget, but then ran into opposition in the Ohio Senate, where the Ohio Chamber had been telling members the dispensing-fee requirement was a tax.
What emerged from the conference committee late Wednesday might have seemed like a compromise to its members. It kept the provision that drug reimbursements would be based on NADAC, the publicly available price list, but it got rid of dispensing fees.
To Burke and other Ohio pharmacists, it’s the worst of both worlds. Not only couldn’t they profit from over-reimbursements under the traditional, non-transparent system, they also couldn’t cover overhead from a fixed dispensing fee.
Of the measure agreed to by the conferees, Burke said, “That proposition only works with a second proposition — the dispensing fee. Because the bag, the bottle, the lid, the pharmacist, the tech, the lights, the heat and the air conditioning all have a cost. In any business model, whether it’s medications, pizzas or cars… you can’t buy ingredients for a dollar and sell pizzas for a dollar and stay in business.”
He predicted that if it becomes law, there will be a mass exodus from the already depleted ranks of Ohio pharmacies.
“If pharmacies can’t make any money — this legislation makes it so that you’re not making any money at all — it would probably force the closure of the overwhelming majority of pharmacies in this state,” Burke said. “Even a child mowing yards is not going to buy a dollar’s worth of gas and accept a dollar to mow your yard.”
Once conferees agree on a budget, Gov. Mike DeWine has the power to veto line-items in it. Burke said he hoped the governor would consider such a move.
“I think the governor’s office would be well placed to consider a veto and we will be expressing our concerns that the legislation is flawed, and that if he doesn’t, the amount of pharmacy closures in Ohio in the next weeks if not months will explode,” Burke said.
Dan Tierney, DeWine’s press secretary, was non-committal when asked about the matter.

“We have not received final budget language but will be reviewing the final language when received,” he said in an email Thursday.
Burke didn’t accuse any of his former colleagues of ill-intent in agreeing to the measure.
“I think they believed that if they stepped in and said we’ll make sure you get paid what you paid for the drug that will fix everything,” Burke said. “But this legislation takes everything you made a profit on and brings it to zero.”
However, he did say he was mystified about the Ohio Chamber’s reasons for intervening in the matter.
“I don’t know where the chamber adopted its stance from, but it’s hard for me, as an independent business owner, to understand why major employers would want to increase their employees’ difficulty getting medications.”
Burke was incensed that the Ohio Chamber would call dispensing fees — payments to cover overhead — a tax.
“It’s amazing to me that the chamber should take the position that business owners should not make a profit,” he said. “I thought the Ohio Chamber was all about profit, pro-business and competitive markets. But they’ve adopted the position that this particular sector of business owners should not make any money. They consider the dispensing fee to be a tax. So apparently, any profit that any business makes is a tax. Maybe they’ve gone socialist over there. I don’t understand. Maybe they’re not looking at their own pharmacy benefit with any understanding.”
The Ohio Chamber didn’t immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment. But earlier this week, Senior Vice President Rick Carfagna said the goal was to protect Ohio businesses from paying too much to underwrite employees’ drugs.
There are, however, questions about the body’s relationship with the giant conglomerates that own the PBMs. For example CVS Health was a “presenting sponsor”  of the Chamber’s 2024 Healthcare Summit, 
Among the questions the Ohio Chamber didn’t immediately respond to was how much CVS paid to sponsor the event — or how much the chamber had received from the big-three conglomerates over the past five years.
In earlier responses, Carfagna didn’t address the growing number of pharmacy deserts in Ohio, or that struggling independent and small-chain pharmacies are themselves small businesses that the Ohio Chamber says it wants to protect.
Burke said all the Ohio Chamber’s members will be harmed if the conference committee language becomes law and mass closures result. That would mean sicker employees with difficulties getting medicine.
“I hope the Chamber actually goes and speaks with the people they’re supposed to represent and see if this policy position is reflective of the way they want to treat their employees,” Burke said.

Arthur had last wishes for his ashes. Obergefell had yet to fulfill them.
“And it struck me that, oh, I am actually now mentally, emotionally ready to take care of John’s ashes,” Obergefell told The 19th. “It was the first time that I had that feeling so clearly and so strongly.”
Obergefell, 58, is ready to move on. Not exactly from the love of his life or the history-making Supreme Court decision that came after Arthur died. But certainly from the insecurities straight America was grappling with a decade ago about same-sex unions.




Obergefell is that Obergefell: the named plaintiff in the landmark lawsuit that extended marriage equality to every state in the nation in 2015. Ten years later, he celebrates that win and the many ways it rewrote his life. And in a time when LGBTQ+ rights are again under assault, he is looking to the future — of the queer rights movement and also his own.
 A journey to the Supreme Court

Obergefell’s journey to the Supreme Court was hardly destined. It began 12 years ago, on June 26, 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that prohibited the government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
Obergefell and Arthur had been together for 21 years at the time. The two had discussed getting married before. But they wanted it to be legal, and their home state of Ohio didn’t offer same-sex marriages.
Arthur was gravely ill with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he barely left his home hospice bed.
After the ruling, Obergefell leaned over to Arthur, hugged, then kissed him.
“Let’s get married,” he said.
Arthur agreed.
The logistics were not easy. Arthur was in no shape to travel, and the couple could not wed in Ohio. Obergefell researched and found that Maryland would let him get a marriage license even with only one of them present. But both would need to arrive in the state for the ceremony.


When friends and family learned about their predicament, they pooled together money to charter a medical jet for Arthur. The two flew to Baltimore. Over the course of 45 minutes, they exchanged vows on the tarmac before flying home.
“In the days that followed, we said the word ‘husband’ hundreds of times a day,” Obergefell said on the Decidedly Podcast in 2023.
But just five days later, their joy was muted when civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein informed them that because of Ohio’s ban on same-sex marriage, Arthur would be listed as single in death.
Arthur and Obergefell were angry. The couple sued the state of Ohio in federal district court and won. Three months later, Arthur died.
The following year, Obergefell, still in mourning, lost on appeal. But he refused to believe he might lose altogether.
“I just kept going,” Obergefell said. “It was the right thing to do.”
On June 26, 2015, he won. For the country, the win was immensely practical. Many told Obergefell it gave them so much hope it saved their lives. For Obergefell, it meant a legacy for the man he loved.
“I made promises to John to love, honor and protect him, and I was going to keep doing that,” he said.
 Changing history

It’s difficult to overstate the impact of Obergefell’s case on the nation or the world. Since the 2015 ruling, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates, 591,000 queer couples have wed, generating an estimated $5.9 billion in wedding spending for state and local economies.
It has also radically transformed Obergefell’s life. Introverted and unassuming, he has spent the last decade campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights. He helms Equality Vines, a wine company that donates its proceeds to advancing civil rights causes.
It’s a position that makes him deeply proud if not a little fatigued.
“I’m not tired of talking about it,” he said of the 10-year anniversary of the ruling. “I’m just physically tired from all of the interviews and the photographers and the speaking gigs and the events. Yes, I’m exhausted.”
For 12 years, Obergefell has kept Arthur alive through retelling their story countless times in courtrooms and for the media. That exercise, of telling and retelling, helped Obergefell process his profound loss.
But he has never recoupled. It wasn’t that Arthur didn’t want him to. In fact, Arthur told him regularly that he wanted him to find love again. He asked his friends and family to tell Obergefell that he wanted him to find love after he was gone.
“I know it was sincere, because he told me that he had other people tell me that,” Obergefell said.
It isn’t about the pressure he feels as the face of marriage equality, he said, though part of him wonders what it would be like to date after making history.
“I don’t know how to date,” he confessed. “I’m clueless when people flirt with me, and as much as I hate it, and I don’t go into any conversation or anything like this, but you know, there’s that part of me that sometimes wonders, you know, are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in me as Jim Obergefell, named plaintiff?”
Obergefell’s name has become synonymous with marriage equality in the United States, an issue that has not always united the LGBTQ+ community. Some queer activists have argued that same-sex marriage was a misguided goal for the movement as queer youth continue to face high rates of homelessness and transgender people grapple with police violence and incarceration, among other issues.
 More work to do

Obergefell, too, is worried that the needs of the community’s most vulnerable have gone unmet. He has watched horror-struck over the last five years as state legislatures have moved to restrict transgender rights.
“We need to fight for every marginalized community, because the queer community includes every marginalized community, and equality for one is pointless without equality for all,” he said. “I didn’t go to the Supreme Court just so White, cisgender, gay men like me could get married.”
Despite all of the setbacks in LGBTQ+ rights, and even threats to Obergefell’s game-changing victory, he is hopeful — and feels stronger than ever. People assume his case was difficult for him. It was, but the path was also obvious, to him and to Arthur. They loved each other.
“If we weren’t willing to fight for each other and for what was right, then what’s the point?”

The group of forty travelers evacuated Israel after missile attacks earlier this month. (Submitted)Lydia Schwartz and Alexa Litwin point to the same moment.
The moment when their cultural trip to Israel this month shifted. The moment that separated a lighthearted, tourist trip from an impromptu war-time evacuation. The moment that triggered days of shattered travel plans, hours in bomb shelters and frantic text messages.
Schwartz, 22, and Litwin, 21, recent college graduates and Jewish Kansans, traveled to their religious homeland as the conflict between Iran and Israel escalated into rocket attacks. 
The moment that changed their trip arrived June 14 at — of all places — a Tel Aviv nightclub.
Litwin was partying at an outdoor club with her brother Sam, who had been in Israel on a separate trip for a month. She was a bit late for the tour group’s appointed curfew when an alert rang out on nearby phones warning of a missile threat. The notification came from an app that participants were asked to download when they arrived in Israel.
“I didn’t even download the app,” Litwin said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, this is stupid. Nothing’s gonna happen. I’m not downloading this dumb app. I don’t have storage on my phone.’ ”
The notification came as Litwin was waiting outdoors for an Uber ride with her brother. Neither had a place to shelter. The best they could do was press themselves against a nearby wall for cover.
When Litwin’s Uber ride eventually delivered them to the group’s lodgings, the Grand Beach Hotel, she saw the trip’s tour guide.
“He was so frantic,” Litwin said. “He’s waving us inside. I’m thinking I’m in trouble because I broke curfew. That’s why he’s waving the way he’s waving. We’re all like, ‘We’re about to get in trouble.’ ”
Instead, he was directing them to the hotel’s shelter. Litwin and her brother ran toward the hotel entrance. Moments later, in the stairwell of the 12-story hotel, Litwin, a little tipsy and very scared, was reunited with Schwartz.
“It was the biggest juxtaposition of all time,” Litwin said. “Here I am partying in one of the coolest cities I’ve ever been in, and then here I am in a bomb shelter with hundreds of other Jews from all over the world.
“And that’s why it’s crazy living in Israel. It’s sad and it’s awful, but that’s what they do. And that’s not going to change any time soon.”
Litwin called her mother in tears, surrounded by other young Jews on the trip who were hugging and comforting each other. Litwin and Schwartz remember telling their parents, “I’m going to die tonight.”
“I’m in the stairwell,” Litwin recalled during an interview this week. “There are missiles being shot out from the sky. I was like, ‘Oh my god, I’m gonna die, and it’s gonna happen in 10 seconds. And everything’s gonna be over, and I’m gonna have no idea that I just died like that.’
“And I couldn’t get that out of my mind. I could literally be dead at any second and not even know it. I was spiraling about that.” 
After hours of waiting, they returned safely to their rooms at 6 a.m.
“Everyone was definitely pretty freaked out,” Litwin said. “Just because it also was not only our first time in Israel having that happen, but our first time in all of our lives having something like that happen. So everyone was definitely on edge a little bit.”
Almost everyone in the stairwell, including Schwartz and Litwin, was in Israel on a Birthright trip, an effort to bind worldwide Jews to Israel. The original 10-day itinerary navigated to holy and scenic spots, while allowing the young people to meet fellow Jews among their group of 40 travelers. The conflict with Iran derailed the itinerary.
However, Litwin and Schwartz said the experience of visiting Israel while it was under attack bound them even more closely to Israel.
Now back in Kansas, they say that even a flawless 10 days in Israel — perfect weather, timely travel connections, amazing new friends, parties every night — couldn’t have strengthened their bond to the nation as well as this chaotic trip filled with sleepless nights, rocket launches and arduous travel.
“Looking back on this trip now, I think I place my Jewish identity on a higher pedestal than I did before walking into this,” Litwin said. “Maybe it’s because I’m just coming out of it, or maybe it’s just everything that happened in Israel. But now my Judaism is in a more important place of who I am than before.”

A community of two
Litwin and Schwartz, best friends who grew up together in the suburbs south of Kansas City, often finish each other’s sentences.
“She’s my No. 1 person for everything,” Schwartz said. “Literally everything.”
Their friendship was knitted together with childhood Jewish cultural and religious activities: church lessons on Sundays and Wednesdays, summers at Jewish sleep-away camps and local meetings of Jewish teens.
“Judaism and the Jewish community has always been a huge part of my life,” Schwartz said.
They attended Blue Valley High School in Overland Park together. This month, both graduated college, Schwartz with an undergraduate degree in clinical psychology from Indiana University and Litwin with a political science degree from the University of Wisconsin. Schwartz will attend law school in the fall.
They signed up for the trip together. Schwartz remembers the uncertainty of visiting a nation that has been in tumult since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered widespread violence in the region.
Schwartz was reassured by a phone call with a woman who worked for the Birthright tour company. She remembers being told: “Israel is always in war. Birthright continues to happen every single year. Everyone is always safe. And if there’s a threat, there’s gonna be a quick pivot, and most of the time we won’t even know.”
The trip began festively. A flight from New York City gave Litwin and Schwartz time to meet other young Jews, mostly from the East Coast.
“We’re talking to our neighbors,” Schwartz recalls. “Everyone’s always up, talking to random people. And everyone’s excited. There just is that feeling of connection, getting on that plane knowing that everyone here is Jewish, and everyone’s going into this with the same intentions that you are.”
Once they landed in Israel, the tour aimed to take them to Tiberius, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the coastal town of Eilat. Even with the missile attacks, their tour group would eventually reach Eilat, but not on the sightseeing itinerary they had saved on their phones.
The first few days, spent mostly in Tiberius, were what they anticipated from the trip. There was only one surprise: a fellow traveler left the group urgently. His father hastily arranged a flight to Dubai to remove him from Israel, fearing the potential attacks that would soon come. At the time, Litwin and Schwartz thought the father and son were overreacting.
Following the night of missile attacks in Tel Aviv, their tour guide gathered them to let them know that the remainder of the trip had been canceled. The goal now was to get them safely home.
 
Everything upside down
The upcoming days were a disorienting blur.
Schwartz described a pleasant dinner at a Jerusalem hotel on June 14. While they had planned to go to a restaurant, they gathered in what they thought was the hotel’s dining room.
“The sirens go off. And everyone’s like, ‘Just stay here. This is actually a bomb shelter,’ ” Schwartz recalls. “So we just continued to have a lovely Shabbat dinner. And I look around. No one’s panicking. And that was so strange, because everyone was panicking” earlier that day.
That feeling of calm was pierced in Eilat the next day. The sounds of missile launches at 4 a.m. woke Litwin from her sleep. They also startled Schwartz, who couldn’t sleep and was making ramen noodles. Their assigned roommate, Mika, was most scared.
“I saw Mika go flying across the room,” Litwin said. “I’ve never seen someone jump the way she jumped across the room. And then I heard it. It sounded like a plane was right next to our ears, but faster than a plane — like a jet.
The town of Eilat was also the port city where they would eventually board a cruise ship that would take them to safety in Cypress.
However, before boarding the ship they again received a threat alert. At the time, Litwin and Schwartz were sitting and listening to music on one of the many buses holding 1,500 young people being evacuated from their Birthright trips. The alerts forced them off the buses. Organizers told them to lie face down on the ground for safety.
Schwartz remembers one girl saying: “Cross your legs and cover your major arteries!”
“Yeah. She was not helping the situation,” Litwin said.
It had been much easier to feel secure in shelters than under a threatening sky, Schwartz said.
“When you’re laying on the ground with 1,500 kids, you just have to pray,” Schwartz said. “Everyone was taking it very seriously. And I think that was where (I realized) in these circumstances, you just have to hope you’re lucky.”
Arriving in Cypress, Schwartz and Litwin knew they had avoided the threat of missile attacks, but they were still far from home.
“I remember talking to my mom on the phone,” Schwartz said. “And I was like, ‘I just can’t be here for another day.’ And she was like, ‘Honestly, I’m not worried. You’re safe. I’m so sorry you’re still there and know how exhausted you are. But you are not in Israel anymore. That’s the most important thing.’ ”
The travel home was a maze of canceled and delayed flights.
“I was exhausted,” Litwin said. “On one part, because of sleep deprivation. On one part, just because you feel very helpless. I felt helpless. I felt like no one was listening.”
Litwin’s flights would take her from Cypress to Cologne, Frankfurt, two airports in New York City, plus Chicago before arriving in Kansas City. Despite fewer flights, Schwartz would arrive in Kansas City about 30 minutes after Litwin.
“You’re constantly not knowing what’s gonna happen,” Litwin said. “You just have so much adrenaline. And then the second I was home, it just depleted. And then I was just exhausted.”
Just days after returning to Kansas, the two friends sat together, reflecting.
“The trip didn’t go the way that it was planned,” Litwin said. “In a way though, I’m thankful for it too. I think it really changed me. It fundamentally reshaped me as a human being. I view things differently now. I appreciate things in a different way.”
Schwartz added: “We were there for this event which put things into perspective. All the little problems that you have on a daily basis don’t matter as much. That directly relates to pride and community. The only thing you have at this moment is your Jewish identity and your connection to the Jews around you. That’s the most important thing that you’re thinking about — that everyone in Israel is thinking about in times like these.”

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). During the lame duck session of 2022, the Ohio legislature passed HB 507, a bill ostensibly about the sale of baby chicks, but loaded up with last-minute oil and gas amendments — including one that required fracking of Ohio state parks and public lands. 
Since then, the Oil and Gas Land Management Commission has sold out our ne public land after another for fracking — including thousands of acres of Ohio’s iconic Salt Fork State Park. Frack well pads are now beginning to surround the park.
Fracking has begun at Valley Run Wildlife Area, and slated to begin soon at Zepernick, Egypt Valley, Keen, Leesville, and Jockey Hollow wildlife areas.  
Flat tax and budget cuts
Shortly after Gov. Mike DeWine signed HB 507, then-Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman told the Ohio Oil and Gas Association that fracking our public lands is a “great revenue generator” for tax cuts. 
“We’re talking about a flat tax right now, perhaps eliminating it,” Huffman said. “Well, where’s that revenue going to come from?”
Now we know the answer.  
This week, a Conference Committee comprised of leaders from the House and Senate finance committees met at 10:30 p.m. — with only 19 minutes notice — to amend and pass HB 96, Ohio’s two-year operating budget bill. It contains a bevy of favors for the oil and gas industry — including fracking our state parks to fund tax cuts for the rich. 
During the final days of testimony in the months-long budget bill process, the Ohio Senate amended HB 96 to include a flat tax — cutting taxes for Ohioans making over $100,000 per year from 3.5% to 2.75% — then cutting agency budget lines to make up the difference. 
Among items on the chopping block is Fund 730321, the Parks and Recreation budget for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. This is money used to staff and maintain our state parks and wildlife areas. The Senate budget cut this fund in half for 2026 — from $55 million to $27.5 million. 
Where did the Senate tell ODNR to make up the difference? From Fund 5BJ1 ALI 7256A6, the State Park Land Royalties Fund — or money that ODNR gets from fracking.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fracking revenue becomes operating revenue
Until now, fracking royalties have been used only for special projects that improve state parks. Now the money will be used for half the parks’ operating expenses — making ODNR even more dependent on fracking for basic revenue, and making the Oil and Gas Land Management Commission even more likely to approve fracking operations. 
This is folly. The oil and gas industry is notoriously boom and bust. Fracking revenue is not guaranteed, and production at frack wells often drops steeply within a few years. 
In addition, wells can be shut down on short notice. Accidents happen — public records show that an oil and gas incident in Ohio every 1.5 days. In addition, ODNR recently shut down a frack pad in Noble County because of increased earthquakes caused by high-pressurized fracking.
Further, fracking puts at risk an industry near our parks that reliably produces income: tourism. Who wants to compete with thousands of brine trucks on rural roads to visit a park surrounded by the noise, light, and pollution of the fracking industry?
Finally ,contrary to statements by state Sen. Jerry Cirino, the people of Ohio who own and use our public lands do not want to see these lands fracked. Public comments on nominations to frack public land routinely run 98% opposed. 
Even more oil and gas favors
Making our parks dependent on fracking isn’t the only favor to the oil and gas industry in the hastily approved state budget. Other fossil fuel goodies include: 

Lengthening fracking leases on public lands for up to 10 years, instead of the current three years.
Requiring ODNR to fast-track fracking leases in 30 days, rushing a process that is supposed to include multiple provisions to protect our public lands.
Prohibiting state agencies from requiring any additional fees beyond those specified in the lease, which could prevent fines for pollution or cleanup after an accident.
Allowing fracked gas projects, now defined by our legislature as “green energy,” to receive air quality revenue bonds, despite their methane pollution.
Cutting the Oil and Gas Well Fund responsible for plugging orphan wells by eliminating filing fees. 

Next steps for the state budget
HB 96 now goes to Gov. DeWine, who has until June 30 to sign it. Unlike for most bills, the governor has line-item veto power for anything budget related. In past budget years, DeWine has not hesitated to use his veto power. 
Will DeWine, who professes publicly to love our state parks, veto the items that will degrade and destroy them? Or will he blithely stand behind the supermajority legislature that favors fossil fuels over renewable energy like wind, solar, and geothermal?
One thing is clear: The people of Ohio own and use our state parks, wildlife areas, and public lands – and we do not want them to be fracked just to provide tax cuts for the rich.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
 Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.










The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares


“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
 Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
 Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.

Don Bacon, U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer and U.S. Rep. Mike Flood on June 19, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)The partnership established by the federal government and universities to support high-level research has been a success story for our country.
That investment has produced a return — measured in technology, innovation and the nurturing of generations of scientific leaders — that has positioned the United States as a global leader across nearly every industry.
The University of Nebraska-Lincoln contributes to this progress by pursuing world-class research as a core part of its land grant mission. Our research outcomes drive economic growth in the state and region and are shared directly with Nebraskans through Nebraska Extension and other outreach.
It’s important to highlight this success as federal support for higher education and university research faces growing scrutiny. Cuts to research funding, freezes on active projects, and delays in grant reviews put America’s global leadership at risk and weaken
our ability to drive innovation and economic growth.
This partnership for research developed in World War II and expanded during the Cold War, the space race and the rise of biomedical research on cancer and other diseases. Universities became leaders in research and innovation with the establishment of the National Science Foundation, the growth of the National Institutes of Health and the creation of NASA and other technology-focused government agencies.
States and universities shared in scientific advancement by investing federal and state funding in the infrastructure and facilities to conduct cutting-edge research. These investments helped train future scientists, ensuring continued expansion of technological advancements.
This research partnership is a source of strength for the U.S., enabling us to dominate in entrepreneurial activity stemming from ongoing discoveries and technological advancement.
Research in agriculture and natural resources has been a central part of this partnership since 1887, when the Hatch Act established a framework for state agricultural experiment stations at public land grant institutions. This legislation provided federal
funding to land grant universities, matched by the states, to conduct research on agriculture and support the health and welfare of rural populations.
The USDA, through programs in its National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), has expanded this research support, providing our producers and communities with science-based practices that deliver on the original promise of the 1887 legislation.
In Nebraska, that landmark legislation has delivered tangible progress in agricultural productivity through practices and technology based on NU research in agriculture and natural resources. Our corn and soybean producers have reduced their pesticide costs and yield losses, thanks to the university’s research and development of crops engineered for traits like insect resistance, herbicide tolerance and drought tolerance.
Our researchers have been leaders in developing precision agriculture technologies and tools — including GPS-guided equipment, yield monitors and variable rate technology for irrigation and fertilization.
The cattle industry has a long, productive history in Nebraska, and producers in the state continue to be leaders in the use of innovative approaches. NU research focusing on cattle nutrition has demonstrated the value of feeding ethanol coproducts to beef
and dairy cattle, a research output that benefits major sectors of our state’s economy.
Research in beef cattle genetics provides cattle breed associations with valuable information for the selection of desirable traits and increased profitability.
These are just a few examples of how University of Nebraska research is delivering real-world benefits for producers and communities. From crop resilience to livestock efficiency, our work is rooted in science and designed for impact. These efforts exemplify the value of sustained investment in research — investment that keeps Nebraska agriculture strong.
The research partnership between universities and the federal government has been vital for American competitiveness and prosperity. The reduction of federal funding for research is not just a problem for our university. It is a problem for America’s status as a global leader in innovation.
Other countries are not standing still. Every year we have a reduction in research funding, we risk losing ground to our competitors.
To continue to advance, we must continue in our global leadership role and invest in all aspects of research and discovery. We lead by focusing on our mission and innovative thinking. Supporting research funding is essential for a bright future for our state and
nation.

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderWhile the Peach State is no stranger to high temperatures, this week was hotter than most. A National Weather Service heat advisory warned of high temperatures and humidity across the state. 
“We basically have an area of high pressure over our area that is allowing these temperatures to be in place,” NWS Peachtree City meteorologist Carmen Hernandez said. “With high temperatures in the upper 90s, along with increased dew points, we are seeing heat indices in the 105 to 109 range.” 
The heat index measures humidity and air temperature to more accurately represent what the temperature feels like to the human body, and it’s considered dangerous after reaching 105 degrees. Georgia reached these levels this week, causing heat advisory to take effect Tuesday and stay in place for most of Georgia through Wednesday evening. The advisory extended through Thursday in the Northwest corner of the state with some areas still feeling as hot as 105 degrees. 
Traditionally, Georgia experiences a couple of heat waves each summer. Even with triple digit heat indices, this week’s weather was not considered abnormal or concerning for weather experts. As the heat wave scorched the state, Atlanta’s NWS shared suggestions to stay cool. Top recommendations included minimizing exposure by staying inside or out of the sun, drinking extra fluids and wearing light colored clothing.
Even with suggested coping mechanisms, dangerous exposure levels put some Georgians at higher risk. According to the NWS, vulnerable groups include the elderly, young children, pets and people who work outside.
While air conditioning remains one of the top recommendations to combat the heat, this is not a luxury afforded by all. Unsheltered populations face increased risk when exposed to high levels of heat. Cooling centers across metro Atlanta helped some avoid extended heat exposure. A Cobb County cooling center at Must Ministries’ Hope House has opened their doors every day this week.
“We operate whenever the temperature is above 90 degrees, and we provide lunch and dinner,” said Falecia Stewart, vice president of housing operations.
Last Friday was the first day of the season above this temperature. Traditionally, the Cobb County cooling center sees its busiest days during the month of July. On Tuesday, when the heat advisory began, the cooling center saw 25 people throughout the day. Visitors are welcomed between 9 A.M. and 6:30 P.M. 
Employees who work outside or inside under harsh temperatures are also a high-risk group. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is an environmental advocacy group, an estimated 1.8 million Georgians work in high-risk jobs that leave them vulnerable to heat-related illness. Farm, food processing, outdoor tourism and construction workers are some of the top occupations prone to heat related illness.
“Heat waves like the one the Southeast and most of the eastern U.S. in general have been facing over the last few days puts additional stress on not only outdoor workers, but indoor workers in hot conditions like kitchens or warehouses,” said Juanita Constible, NRDC senior advocate. “Along with the heat comes the risk of everything from mild heat related cramps and dehydration, to potential death from heatstroke or even cardiovascular illnesses that can be exacerbated by heat.”
Regular rest breaks, shade or air-conditioned spaces and staying hydrated remain the best options to protect people working through heat waves. Constible said she believes that companies with workers who face increased risks should have a written safety plan in place before a heat wave arrives.
A number of animal advocacy groups also echoed NWS’s warnings in hopes of spreading awareness on how to protect Georgia’s four-legged friends. 
Unlike humans, dogs are unable to regulate their body temperatures by sweating. This makes them more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Panting serves as an alternative allowing water to evaporate from their mouths in an attempt to cool down. However, panting can be insufficient in the level of heat currently encompassing the state. 
Dr. Jaclyn Luckstone, president of the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association, recommends walking pets during cooler times to avoid risks.
“If you’re going to take them for a walk, check the pavement with your hand and feel how hot it is, because pets can easily burn their paws on it,” Luckstone said. “If you put your hand on the pavement, and you can’t leave it there for more than a few seconds, then it’s too hot for them to walk on.”
Claudine Wilkins has worked in the animal advocacy world for 37 years. As the executive director of The Animal Protection Society, as well as co-founder of the Georgia Pet Coalition, Wilkins regularly works to fight against animal cruelty. 
“Georgia is well known to have lots of problems when it comes to summertime with animals and heat stroke,” Wilkins said.
With the exception of fish and most pests, animals are legally protected in Georgia. This means that leaving animals in hot vehicles can lead to a criminal charge. Wilkins urges bystanders to call local police for assistance if they encounter an animal trapped in a hot car during the heat wave or any warm day. 
“Our habits stay the same, and we get used to our air-conditioned cars, houses and workplaces (so) we don’t think about the animals as much,” Wilkins said.
Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper also encouraged Georgians to look out for their pets and livestock.
“With extreme heat expected for the remainder of the week, I am encouraging all Georgians to take steps to protect their pets and livestock from heat stress,” Harper said. “GDA has resources available to help you identify signs of heat stress in your animals and how you can prevent it.”
Much of the East Coast and Midwest joined Georgia underneath a heat dome encompassing large parts of the country this week. As of Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Atlanta was one of 62 major cities with forecasts showing dangerous levels of heat.
After a long week of sweltering temperatures Georgians can look forward to some relief with forecasts showing highs in the 80s through the entirety of next week.

Ned Lamont’s veto of HB 5002—a housing bill aimed at encouraging modest, statewide growth —sent a loud message: we will wait for local consensus, even if that means affirming the same local resistance that got us here. 
In doing so, Lamont breathed new life into what I’ve come to call the No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition—a powerful and persistent force committed to freezing Connecticut in place.
This isn’t a political abstraction. It’s a real, measurable cost. I know, because I’m paying for it.
My family and I moved to Woodbridge last July, from Hartford. We’re raising one child and are proud to have made a home in a town known for its beauty, its schools, and its promise of opportunity.
I didn’t grow up thinking I’d ever live in a place like this. I was born and raised in Waterbury, Puerto Rican, and poor— the kind of poor that teaches you how fragile opportunity can be. I worked hard. I had help. And I earned the chance to make a choice my mother couldn’t: where to raise my child.
We came to Woodbridge to build a future —and to believe that belonging wasn’t reserved for those born behind an invisible curtain of opportunity.
Moving here peeled back that curtain. Within months, we received a mailer from a local group pushing hard against modest local housing proposals —signaling loud and clear that, for some, growth is something to resist, not plan for.
That mailer pushed me to act. I joined the Woodbridge Democratic Town Committee because I wanted to fight back.
And what I found gave me hope: neighbors already in the fight —for fairness, for more housing, for a future that includes more families like mine. But they were swimming against a tide of organized resistance —too often drowned out by voices determined to keep the door closed.
That resistance doesn’t wear a party label. It doesn’t show up with signs. But it shows up in every delay, every deflection, every denial of change. It insists that any step forward is a threat, and any new neighbor is a burden.
That’s the quiet mission of the No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition: preserve everything, change nothing, and hope the math works out.
A few months after moving in, our property tax assessment shot up —a financial shock that felt less like a welcome and more like a warning. It didn’t take long to understand what was happening. And it’s happening across Connecticut.
Woodbridge isn’t failing – it’s choosing not to grow. Choosing to keep the door barely open. Choosing exclusion — quietly, structurally — and passing the cost onto the very people it claims to welcome.  
Some in our community love this town so much, they’ve tried to freeze it in time. But protectionism is exclusion. 
I don’t question the motives. I question the outcome. A town that refuses to grow doesn’t stay the same. It just shifts the burden—until fewer people can afford to stay, and fewer still can come at all.
Rejecting growth didn’t pause our bills. It blocked our ability to spread them fairly—across a broader, stronger, more diverse community already knocking at the door.
That’s not preservation. It’s exclusion. And it’s expensive.
I didn’t come to radically change Woodbridge. I came here because I believed in its promise – a promise now at risk. Not just for newcomers like me, but for longtime residents who want their kids nearby, for seniors who want to downsize without leaving, and for families who want a future here, not just a past. 
At a recent Democratic Town Committee meeting, I overheard someone share a story: their grown child had expressed frustration that they couldn’t afford to come back home —to buy a house in the very town they grew up in. That’s not just a loss for one family. It’s a quiet warning for us all.
To those who fear that growth will change the character of our towns, I ask: isn’t it already changing?
When longtime neighbors can’t afford to stay?
When their children can’t afford to return?
When young families can’t afford to come?
When tax hikes on a frozen grand list become the only tool left?
You don’t have to have all the answers. You don’t need to be an expert in zoning or budgets to know that this isn’t working for everyone. Even if you’re just starting to ask the questions—there’s room for you in our movement for a fair and affordable Connecticut.
The cost of exclusion is high, but the cost of letting it define our future is even higher.
The No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition may be loud. But they are not the majority. It’s time for those of us who believe in fairness, in inclusive growth, and in towns that welcome —not withhold— to speak up, to act, to lead.
Let’s build better Connecticut communities —169 united for growth and opportunity—so that working people, young families, seniors, and longtime residents alike can belong and grow together. That’s how we take down the invisible curtain of exclusion.
We can build a future that includes all of us. Everyone has a role, and I want to build with you.
And so should Lamont.",,,,2025-06-27 00:58:58.051514

Ned Lamont’s decision to veto the bill that would have extended unemployment benefits to workers engaged in a labor strike. 
We thank the Governor for recognizing the concerns of Connecticut’s business community and for prioritizing the long-term stability of the state’s economic and workforce systems.
Connecticut’s unemployment trust fund is funded entirely by businesses. Expanding eligibility to include striking workers would increase costs for employers across the state at a time when many are still recovering from the economic disruptions of recent years. These added costs would be especially difficult for small and mid-sized businesses, as well as other employers that already operate on thin margins.
Throughout this process, chambers of commerce, trade associations, and business organizations from across the state came together to express their shared concern about the bill’s impact. Our message was consistent and collaborative: any changes to the unemployment system must be made carefully and with full consideration of the economic ripple effects on local employers.
Governor Lamont’s decision reflects that understanding. By maintaining the integrity of the unemployment insurance program, his veto sends a signal that Connecticut is committed to a strong, stable economic climate that supports both workers and the employers who create jobs and opportunity.
The Greater New Haven Chamber remains focused on advancing policies that strengthen our region’s economy, support innovation and growth, and ensure that Connecticut is a competitive and welcoming place to do business. We look forward to continued dialogue with state leaders on ways to support our workforce, grow our economy, and build shared prosperity for the long term.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed four bills into law on Tuesday, including two related to child care, one addressing big-game hunting, and one that updates the state’s insurance laws.
Senate Bill 96 creates a tax credit program that rewards companies that offer child care programs for their workers. 
Senate Bill 95 raises the income limit for families eligible to receive state child care aid, expanding the number of people who may receive it. It also allows the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development to distribute grants to the highest-quality child care centers in the state, as determined by whether a center is part of the state’s ranked system.
The Legislature passed both bills last year, but each were stymied by a lawsuit that challenged the way that lawmakers combined bills in an effort to pass them more speedily. The Alaska Constitution limits bills to a single subject.
The governor’s signature on Senate Bill 97 creates a hunting concession program for big-game hunting guides. The federal government already sells hunting concessions on federal land, and SB 97, drafted with the help of the state’s Big Game Commercial Services Board, implements a similar system for state land.
Dunleavy also signed Senate Bill 132, the state’s omnibus insurance bill. That lengthy measure includes changes to the way the state handles pharmacy benefit managers, middlemen who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurance plans.
The bill also expands the types of health insurance that employers can offer their workers, requires financial reporting by insurers, includes consumer protection improvements and makes changes for nonresident insurance adjusters in Alaska.

Though Utah Sen. Mike Lee scaled back his public lands sale proposal, protesters gathered in Cheyenne to demand Wyoming's congressional delegation oppose the plan.
The post Public lands rally draws large, varied crowd to Wyoming statehouse appeared first on WyoFile .","Though broad pushback already drove Utah Sen. Mike Lee to scale back his public lands sell-off proposal for the Republicans’ big budget bill, a large and boisterous crowd still gathered Thursday evening in front of the Wyoming State Capitol to send the message “not for sale.”  
The group of hunters, anglers, snowmobilers, hikers, wildland firefighters and scientific researchers numbered well into the hundreds and was likely one of the largest protest groups to gather at the statehouse in recent years. The high turnout in Cheyenne showcased what Lee’s proposal has once again reminded the West — selling off public lands sparks fierce political opposition. 
Though organized by Democratic state representative Karlee Provenza and other well-known Wyoming progressives, a handful of attendees told WyoFile they were conservative voters outraged at the land sale. 
“I’d like to thank Sen. Mike Lee for bringing us all together,” Provenza told the crowd. “I’m just kidding,” she continued, “let’s boo that son of a bitch.” 
And so the crowd did, loudly.
After initially pushing a sale that could have topped more than 3 million acres across 11 western states, Lee stripped U.S. Forest Service lands from his proposal and refocused it on Bureau of Land Management parcels within 5 miles of cities and towns. Lee has described the sale as a measure to boost the construction of affordable housing. His bill language was light on enforcement requirements for affordability, however. Lee’s longtime crusade to trim down the amount of federal land in the country also made his suggestion that the sale could mitigate a housing shortage difficult to swallow for his opponents. 

Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, leads the crowd at a Thursday rally for public lands in a chant, while leaving a voicemail for U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman. 
Conservation groups, hook-and-bullet advocacy organizations and other opponents are watching this week to see whether Lee’s new language will pass muster with the Senate Parliamentarian, a legislative referee of sorts who has been ruling on what measures can and can’t go into the budget bill. 
The parliamentarian rejected Lee’s previous proposal.
In Cheyenne, rally goers listened as speakers described the bond Wyomingites have to public lands — whether that’s the iconic peaks and canyons or the parcels close to town that give the state its unique character. Those latter lands are the ones Lee now seeks to put on the chopping block, some speakers said. 
David Wilms, a former staff member for Republican Gov. Matt Mead who now works as an attorney for the National Wildlife Federation, said Lee would sell off plots of land where young kids catch their first string of trout and new hunters bag their first deer. Though Lee may have backed off the more drastic sale, Wilms urged public land advocates to keep up the fight both for the length of the current debate and beyond. 
“He only needs to win once,” Wilms said of Lee. “We need to win every time.” 
Among the crowd was James Schick, a Cheyenne pharmacist who said he considers himself an independent voter but leans more conservative than liberal. He criticized Lee for trying to ram policy with such intense public interest into law through a budget bill that Republicans in control of Washington, D.C. see as a must-pass measure. 
“We need to have these types of conversations in a reasonable and gracious manner,” Schick said. “Don’t try to force an agenda that is industry-based, it seems like, on our public land.” 
Another attendee held a sign that said, “if there was ever a hill to die on, it’s a public land hill.” He declined to share his name with WyoFile, saying he worked in government and did not want to face reprisal. But he described himself as feeling betrayed by Sen. John Barrasso after backing the Casper doctor in every campaign he’s mounted. 
“Apparently, Barrasso, [Sen. Cynthia] Lummis and [Rep.] Harriet Hageman back this,” he said, “because Hageman said ‘don’t worry your wildernesses, your national parks, your national monuments, you can still hunt and fish them.’ Well, who hunts on wildernesses but tourists? Outfitters take tourists into the wilderness. I’m not going to pack my kid 14 miles in for his first [deer]. This is Wyoming, are you kidding me?” 
Under Lee’s original proposal, designations like national parks and wildlife refuges were exempted from sale. Though Wyoming’s congressional delegation has not explicitly backed Lee’s proposal in public comments, they have not criticized it either, and all have expressed support for some level of federal land sell-off. 
At the rally, Provenza and other speakers called on Wyoming’s congressional delegation to push back explicitly on Lee to keep the public lands surrounding Wyoming towns intact.
“Why the hell is Harriet Hageman, or John Barrasso or Cynthia Lummis not with us here today?” she asked.

The state’s minimum wage increased to $11.91 this month and will rise to $13 in July. (Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The minimum wage will increase in 15 states and cities in July, though lawmakers in other states have worked to slow down wage hikes.
Wage floor increases beginning July 1 in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will benefit more than 880,000 workers by collectively raising their earnings by more than $397 million, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
In Alaska, the $11.91 minimum wage will increase to $13 per hour. Oregon’s $14.70 standard figure will rise to $15.05 (the state has separate rates for urban and nonurban counties). And the $17.50 minimum in the District of Columbia will move to $17.95.
Another dozen cities will see minimum wage increases this summer, including Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Currently, 30 states and D.C. have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
In many states, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted upward as inflation rises. But voters in several states last year elected to significantly increase their minimum wages.

The institute noted that lawmakers have pushed to “water down” some of those voter initiatives.
In Missouri, for example, voters approved a November measure to mandate paid sick time for many workers and boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026, with future hikes tied to inflation. But lawmakers in May eliminated the sick leave requirement and nixed the inflation adjustment, meaning the minimum wage will not automatically increase as voters approved.
“Our side of the aisle has great concern for the burden that this would place on businesses,” Missouri Senate Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican, said in May about the ballot measure, “and if we’re going to promote economic growth and jobs, we need to really be cognizant of that.”
Similarly, Nebraska lawmakers this year aimed to cap future wage increases approved by voters in a 2022 ballot measure. That legislation failed to advance.
Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a national network of business owners and executives, said in a Thursday news release that increased minimum wages are good for employees and businesses alike.
Steven Dyme, CEO of Flowers for Dreams, said higher base wages encourage low-wage workers to spend more locally. The flower store has locations in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.
“Building our business with living wages has ensured the best floral talent, a product quality that’s truly cared for, and a trusting customer base,” he said in the news release.

Jared Polis want his assurance that he will not ask state employees to comply with a subpoena from federal immigration authorities in light of a court ruling in their favor.
Denver District Court Judge A. Bruce Jones issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday that prohibits Polis’ office from forcing certain state employees to hand over records on 35 sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant children in the state to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The injunction only applies to employees of the Division of Labor Standards and Statistics within the state’s labor department, which is directed by lead plaintiff Scott Moss. 
The lawsuit alleged that disclosing the data would violate a state law against data sharing with ICE unless it is for a criminal investigation or under a judge-signed subpoena. Two unions that represent state employees, Colorado WINS and AFL-CIO, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

“Judge Jones has protected these state workers by blocking this order that would have implicated them in breaking a state law,” Diane Byrne, president of Colorado WINS, said at a press conference at the Colorado Capitol Thursday. “This protection is critical, especially when these orders come from your boss, and in this case, the governor himself.” 
Byrne said the union asked Polis in a letter Thursday “to confirm that he will not direct any state employees to assist with the search or production of personal identifying information” to comply with the ICE subpoena. 
“Once we get that confirmation in, we will celebrate this as a victory for all state workers and for all workers in Colorado, because it will demonstrate that the law can protect you, even when dealing with the biggest boss in the state,” Byrne said. 
The letter, written by Colorado WINS executive director Hilary Glasgow, says that while the “preliminary injunction pertains to employees of the Division of Labor‬ Standards and Statistics, it is clear that if it is a violation of the statute for these employees to comply with the subpoena, the same holds true for all state employees.”
“ICE is violating human rights every minute. The governor should be stopping this horrific behavior, not facilitating it,” Dennis Dougherty, executive director of the Colorado AFL-CIO, said. “We are disappointed that this had to go to court … to shed light on this illegal coordination. Had a brave state employee not come forward, these caregivers and children would have been rounded up, possibly violently, and had their lives destroyed while Coloradans didn’t know anything about it.” 
Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said in a statement that the governor’s office is reviewing the court’s preliminary ruling as well as the letter from Colorado WINS. 
“Governor Polis remains committed to fully and promptly cooperating with federal criminal investigations into child trafficking and exploitation, while protecting unaccompanied children in Colorado,” Wieman said. “We hope that if information is needed for criminal investigations, going forward, (ICE investigators) will provide subpoenas for state information consistent with this ruling to ensure prompt processing.”
Colorado in recent years has enacted state laws, including legislation Polis, a Democrat, signed in 2021 and earlier this year, that limit the sharing of data about immigrants with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Byrne said state employees are concerned about retaliation if they report that they were asked to comply with the ICE subpoena. Laura Wolf, a lawyer who represents Moss in the case, said it’s likely that other state employees were asked to produce records for the subpoena, and plaintiffs created a website where those employees can report their experiences, even anonymously if desired. 
Wolf said the governor’s office provided no notice to the people listed in the subpoena that their information would be turned over to ICE. 
“The court said that it would be ‘very problematic’ if they were to ever turn over this information to ICE without first notifying these individuals so they could assert their rights, and that is a huge victory,” Wolf said. “And we need to be sure everyone in this state knows and that the governor knows that he is required to notify these individuals and can no longer act in the shadows, behind the scenes, in darkness, and instead needs to inform people before he hands over personal identifying information for deportation efforts.”
The ICE subpoena, which was not signed by a judge, seeks personal information, such as addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and employment history, on the sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant children, purportedly in order to check on the children’s welfare and investigate any potential child abuse. Polis decided to comply with the subpoena in late May after some deliberation. His lawyers argued that complying with the subpoena was permissible under a criminal-investigation exception in state law, though the subpoena does not mention a specific investigation.
State Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat who sponsored both laws adding protections for immigrants, said Colorado law “has been tested,” so government employees around the state should say something if they see a potential violation. 
“This law is meant to ensure that prior to any personally identifying information (being) shared with any federal agency for the purposes of immigration enforcement, that they go talk to a judge,” Gonzales said. “That they go get a warrant. That the administrative subpoena that happened to mention the word ‘criminal’ or ‘crime’ doesn’t cut it.”
State Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat who sponsored the 2025 law strengthening protections for immigrants, said ICE’s job is not to ensure child welfare, so if there are actual child welfare concerns, the state should use the appropriate channels and state agencies to do so.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Australian company seeking to develop a large oil discovery on Alaska’s North Slope may be purchased by a consortium based in Abu Dhabi.
Santos Ltd. announced earlier this month that XRG PJSC, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., has made a buyout offer. Terms are still being negotiated.
The value of the proposed deal is $36 billion, including Santos’ debt.
Santos is one of Australia’s oldest and biggest oil and gas companies. It has operations in Australia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Timor-Leste – and in Alaska, where it owns 51% of the Pikka prospect on the western North Slope and is the project’s operator. Repsol, based in Spain, owns 49%.
Pikka, if developed, would produce up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day, according to Santos. The field holds about 400 million barrels of oil, and Santos in 2022 issued its formal approval to proceed to project development. The capital cost was estimated at $2.6 billion at the time.
Pikka is located near the ConocoPhillips-operated projects within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Pikka and ConocoPhillips’ huge Willow project, which is in development, are both connected to the Nanushuk geologic formation, a layer of oil-bearing rock underlying areas of the central and western North Slope.
Aside from its share of Pikka, Santos has part ownership of another oil property on the North Slope. It owns a 25% share of the Sockeye prospect on the eastern North Slope, where operator and 50% owner APA Corp. made a discovery that was announced in March.
If the acquisition by XRG PJSC goes through, the impacts to the Alaska projects are yet to be determined.
State officials have been following the process.
John Boyle, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, by email: “The Department of Natural Resources sees new entrants/investors into Alaska’s oil and gas sector as a positive development.”
There were reports last year about efforts by Santos and Repsol to sell some shares of their Alaska holdings. 
In Australia, the idea of Santos being acquired by an Abu Dhabi company has created some controversy. Government and labor union officials there have raised concerns about the takeover, with one regional government proposing some conditions on the transaction.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The minimum wage will increase in 15 states and cities in July, though lawmakers in other states have worked to slow down wage hikes.
Wage floor increases beginning July 1 in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will benefit more than 880,000 workers by collectively raising their earnings by more than $397 million, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
In Alaska, the $11.91 minimum wage will increase to $13 per hour. Oregon’s $14.70 standard figure will rise to $15.05 (the state has separate rates for urban and nonurban counties). And the $17.50 minimum in the District of Columbia will move to $17.95.
Another dozen cities will see minimum wage increases this summer, including Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Currently, 30 states and D.C. have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
In many states, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted upward as inflation rises. But voters in several states last year elected to significantly increase their minimum wages.

The institute noted that lawmakers have pushed to “water down” some of those voter initiatives.
In Missouri, for example, voters approved a November measure to mandate paid sick time for many workers and boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026, with future hikes tied to inflation. But lawmakers in May eliminated the sick leave requirement and nixed the inflation adjustment, meaning the minimum wage will not automatically increase as voters approved.
“Our side of the aisle has great concern for the burden that this would place on businesses,” Missouri Senate Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican, said in May about the ballot measure, “and if we’re going to promote economic growth and jobs, we need to really be cognizant of that.”
Similarly, Nebraska lawmakers this year aimed to cap future wage increases approved by voters in a 2022 ballot measure. That legislation failed to advance.
Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a national network of business owners and executives, said in a Thursday news release that increased minimum wages are good for employees and businesses alike.
Steven Dyme, CEO of Flowers for Dreams, said higher base wages encourage low-wage workers to spend more locally. The flower store has locations in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.
“Building our business with living wages has ensured the best floral talent, a product quality that’s truly cared for, and a trusting customer base,” he said in the news release.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Attorneys for the North Dakota Legislature on Thursday rebuked an attorney general’s opinion of a veto error and outlined possible next steps, which could include a special legislative session or legal challenges.
Lawmakers asked Legislative Council to research options after an error with a line-item veto Gov. Kelly Armstrong issued May 19 in the budget for the state Industrial Commission. 
Armstrong’s veto message said he objected to a $150,000 one-time grant for a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. But his staff also crossed out $25 million for housing projects and programs and $10 million to combat homelessness in a bill markup, which he later said he did not intend to veto.
Armstrong asked Attorney General Drew Wrigley for his office’s opinion on whether the veto message would be considered the official document instead of the marked-up bill.
Wrigley found that the unintentional markup does not change the substance of the veto because Armstrong’s written veto message was “clear and unambiguous” about what parts of Senate Bill 2014 he intended to cut.
Lawmakers and the governor agree that the $35 million should be spent, but legislators are worried about the precedent that would be set and possible future implications.
North Dakota governor’s veto ‘clear and unambiguous,’ attorney general says

Emily Thompson, legal division director for the Legislative Council, pushed back on the findings of the attorney general’s office in a new memo presented to the Legislative Management Committee Thursday.
The analysis called the attorney general’s opinion inconsistent with the state constitution, judicial precedent, a previous attorney general’s opinion and the practice of former governors.
Thompson pointed out that Wrigley’s opinion did not mention the most recent North Dakota Supreme Court precedent that involved a similar issue with former Gov. Doug Burgum. 
In that case, the court stated the governor may strike words or numbers while exercising a veto, but may not insert them. Thompson argued Wrigley’s opinion is in direct contrast to the court’s ruling.
She said the opinion sets a precedent allowing the governor and attorney general to come to an agreement on what the governor intended to veto. Thompson said future governors could write extremely vague veto letters.
“You have more or less two members of the executive branch determining what was or wasn’t vetoed based on the agreement on what that intent was,” she said.
The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to requests for comment Thursday on the new Legislative Council memo. Wrigley previously said Legislative Council has no role in determining the exercising authority of the governor’s veto.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said he and House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, plan to talk to Wrigley about the opinion.
“I assume there’s no prohibition on us going to the attorney general and saying, ‘Are you sure?’” Hogue said.
The $35 million in housing funds are set to be disbursed as soon as Tuesday when the new fiscal year begins. Armstrong said in a news release after Wrigley’s opinion was issued that the $35 million “will be disbursed as approved.” 
‘Prudent remedy’ for veto error is special session, Legislative Council advises

Lawmakers questioned how the full $35 million could advance when Armstrong said he intended to veto $150,000 of that.
“That’s a headscratcher,” Hogue said.
Lawmakers directed Legislative Council to do additional research over the next seven days to help them determine next steps. Thompson presented some options to legislators:

Lawmakers could petition the North Dakota Supreme Court to review the matter. 
Lawmakers could call themselves back into session and consider overriding the governor’s veto. That would require a two-thirds majority vote of elected members in each chamber.
Lawmakers could do nothing and allow Wrigley’s opinion to stand as precedent. Legislators said they could consider new legislation in 2027 to clarify the governor’s veto powers.

A special session of the Legislature costs about $65,000 per day, according to Legislative Council. However, members of the Legislative Council said attorney’s fees for a court case could rise to that level or surpass it.
Lawmakers did not make a decision Thursday but appeared inclined to take some kind of action.
“We’re dealing with the separation of powers, which is a really important thing,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said legislative leaders hope lawmakers won’t have to return to Bismarck for a special session. But he also recognizes the importance of protecting the Legislature’s authority.
“Some things were ignored in the opinion,” Weisz said. “It’s up to us to make sure that we keep our authority as the Legislature and we need to understand what the governor is vetoing and not have to rely on, ‘OK, what did he veto? Well, I guess the AG will tell us what he vetoed.’ It’s not the way it’s supposed to work.”

(Screenshot)The Republican primary for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat just got more crowded. 
Nate Morris, a Lexington businessman who founded waste and recycling company Rubicon, announced his candidacy in a 20-minute interview on Donald Trump Jr.’s “Triggered” podcast Thursday evening. 
“After careful reflection and prayer talking to my wife, Jane, I’ve decided to run for the United States Senate to replace Mitch McConnell here in Kentucky, and finally, bring this seat back to the people,” Morris said. 
Morris joins a Republican field that already includes U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and former Attorney General Daniel Cameron. They announced their candidacies earlier this year after longtime U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell announced he would not seek reelection in 2026. 
In his podcast appearance with Republican President Donald Trump’s son, Morris carved himself out as the total opposite of McConnell, who is also the longest serving U.S. Senate party leader. 
“Well, everyone has an expiration, Don, they have an expiration date, just like the things you find at the grocery store or anywhere else, and Mitch McConnell has hung around way too long,” Morris told the president’s son. “And I think your father put it best: The stench of Mitch has been something that you cannot ignore.” 
Morris added that McConnell is the “final boss” for the president to defeat. McConnell and the president have clashed in the past, but as the Senate Republican leader, McConnell paved the way for Trump’s federal judiciary appointments, including floor votes for three key Supreme Court appointments. 
 During the podcast, Morris tried to hitch his primary opponents to McConnell’s legacy. Cameron, who was often referred to as a McConnell protege during the 2023 governor’s race, “completely botched” that election, Morris said. As for Barr, Morris highlighted a recent TV interview in which he referred to McConnell as a mentor, and the podcast also aired that video clip. 
Barr quickly released Thursday evening statements attacking Morris’ campaign, saying he did not support the president in the 2024 presidential primary. 
“Nate Morris is pretending to be MAGA now, but he can’t run from all the liberal trash in his past,” Barr said. “Kentucky conservatives won’t fall for this fraud.”
Barr also tied himself to the president, pointing out that he was the state chair for Trump’s campaign in the 2024 primary.
“When I’m in the Senate, I’ll be President Trump’s biggest ally. Others in this race have opposed the President in the past and give lip service to supporting him now. I am the only candidate in this race who has a proven track record of actually delivering for President Trump and our America First movement.” 
Cameron’s campaign pushed a website it launched, FakeNate.com, to criticize Morris’ record, particularly on the 2024 primary and his business record. 
“Nate is an America First pretender trying to pull the wool over your eyes. Nate’s money might buy him likes on social media, but we’re not going to let him buy him an election,” the Cameron campaign said. 
The three Republican candidates have been courting President Trump’s endorsement for months. Cameron had the president’s backing in the 2023 governor’s race before losing to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Barr has repeatedly voiced support for Trump’s agenda. Morris himself has been included in a recent White House press release. 
Trump Jr. said Morris has “a very similar sort of life story to JD Vance,” the vice president from Ohio who has ties to Appalachian Kentucky. Morris’ family is from Morgan County, he was raised by a single mother and he looked up to his grandfather, who was the head of the local auto union, according to his website. Morris said that he and Vance became “very fast friends” because of their backgrounds. 
On the Democratic side, Kentucky House Minority Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, has mounted a campaign to run for U.S. Senate. In 2023, she was the Democratic nominee for attorney general but lost to Republican Russell Coleman.

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle Charges against a Spanish-language journalist who was arrested while covering a protest in metro Atlanta earlier this month have been dropped, though he continues to face potential deportation.
Mario Guevara, who is originally from El Salvador, was arrested at a June 14 protest held to demonstrate opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration policies. He was charged with unlawful assembly, obstruction of a law enforcement officer and improperly entering a roadway, all of which are misdemeanors. 
DeKalb County Solicitor-General Donna Coleman-Stribling announced Wednesday that her office has dismissed those charges.
A review of the video evidence showed that Guevara was generally in compliance with the directives of law enforcement agencies at the protest and did not appear to intend to disregard any of those directives, according to a press release from Coleman-Stribling’s office.
“After carefully reviewing the evidence, including video evidence surrounding his arrest, I have determined that while there was probable cause to support the initial arrest, the evidence is insufficient to sustain a prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said in a statement.
Guevara was wearing a vest marking him as a member of the press when he was arrested. He can also be heard on his livestream of the protest identifying himself as a reporter to law enforcement.
Guevara’s arrest and detainment has alarmed First Amendment defenders. The Committee to Protect Journalists and other free press advocates sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem urging her to facilitate Guevara’s release.
Guevara has lived in the U.S. for about 20 years. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported that Guevara has work authorization and the ability to gain a green card through his son, who is a U.S. citizen, but Guevara does not have permanent legal status here. 
He is currently being held at the Folkston Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center in South Georgia.
“This El Salvador national is in ICE custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement.
In the same statement, McLaughlin encouraged anyone here illegally to “take control of their departure.” The Trump administration is offering people $1,000 and a free flight to self-deport.
Guevara’s attorney did not respond to a message seeking comment Thursday. But the attorney, Giovanni Díaz, told Atlanta Civic Circle that he is optimistic Guevara will secure a bond when he appears before a federal immigration judge for a hearing set for Tuesday.
Diaz also told Atlanta Civic Circle that he is trying to get additional unrelated charges in Gwinnett County dismissed. Guevara was charged with distracted driving, failure to obey a traffic control device and reckless driving while filming ICE activity there, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.
Guevara was one of 29 people arrested at the DeKalb County protest on June 14.
DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson issued the findings from an internal review done on the handling of the protest. She noted the protest was one of three held that day in DeKalb County as thousands of Georgians turned out for “No Kings” events, though the protest where Guevara and others were arrested was not affiliated with the national movement.
“We’ve heard from residents over the past week, especially members of our immigrant community, who are hurt, angry, and scared,” Cochran-Johnson said in a statement. “I want to acknowledge that pain. The right to protest, to speak out, and to be treated with dignity. In DeKalb County, we remain deeply committed to those values.”

Increasing egg imports, enhancing biosecurity, researching vaccine options and providing financial relief to farmers were all elements of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ plan to combat HPAI and lower the cost of eggs. 
Rollins said her five-pronged plan “has worked,” noting a 64% drop in wholesale egg prices and more than 900 completed biosecurity assessments at poultry farms across the country. 
Rollins announced the $1 billion plan to combat the bird flu in February after three years of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu had eliminated nearly 170 million poultry birds and caused domestic egg prices to skyrocket.

From January 2024 to June 2024, the U.S. imported around 2.36 million shell eggs and just over 9.2 million egg products, according to an egg markets report from USDA. 
The USDA release said the U.S. had imported more than 26 million shell eggs, by the dozen, from Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, Turkey, and South Korea and imported an additional 14 million egg products, measured in dozen shell-egg equivalents since January 2025. 
A USDA egg market report from May showed the majority, 57% of imported shell eggs came from the nation of Türkiye. 
The USDA press release said the efforts to increase imports have helped to “bolster domestic supply” and said by comparison, domestic egg production in 2024 totaled 109 billion eggs. 
Iowa remains the top egg producing state in the country and to date has lost more than 29 million birds associated with commercial table egg production impacted by HPAI, according to data from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
Biosecurity improvements 
As part of Rollins’ plan, producers could have free biosecurity assessments at their facilities and receive USDA assistance for biosecurity improvements. 
According to the release from USDA, nearly 1,000 facilities have received the assessments, including 162 facilities in Iowa. 

Producers can email poultry.biosecurity@usda.gov or call 844-820-2234 to request these assessments.

Iowa ranked second on the list of states with the highest number of biosecurity assessments, behind Ohio at 214 assessments and above Pennsylvania at 144, Indiana at 129 and Missouri at 80 assessments. 
Of the assessments completed, 372 have looked at wildlife biosecurity according to APHIS.
Rollins encouraged poultry producers to utilize the free assessments before the fall when wild bird migration will increase the potential for bird flu outbreaks. 
“While we are proud that over 900 biosecurity assessments have been conducted to date, resources remain available, and we are urging poultry farmers of all sizes to get your assessments done today before a potentially challenging fall,” Rollins said in the release. 
USDA has paid farmers more than $70 million to replenish their flocks since February when USDA increased the indemnity values available to producers with layer flocks affected by HPAI.  
The department also announced a grant challenge opportunity in March for research projects to support HPAI prevention, therapeutics, and potential vaccines. The Thursday release said the department received requests for more than $793 million in funding and the awards will be finalized in the fall. 
“When President Trump entered office, the cost of eggs was at a record high, seriously denting consumers’ wallets after years of awful inflation,” Rollins said in her statement. “On my first day as secretary, we got to work to implement a five-pronged strategy to improve biosecurity on the farm and lower egg prices on grocery store shelves. The plan has worked, and families are seeing relief with egg prices driving food deflation in the April Consumer Price Index.”

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)A political committee that helped defeat last year’s ballot measure to repeal a Washington climate law was fined $20,000 on Thursday for not disclosing how it spent $1 million until after the election.
The state Public Disclosure Commission levied the civil penalty on Green Jobs PAC, which admitted to the violation and two other breaches of Washington campaign finance laws as part of an agreed upon settlement.
On a 4-0 vote, commissioners imposed the civil penalty of $20,000. It suspended half the sum as long as $10,000 is paid in 30 days and the group does not commit any more violations in the next four years. 
“This was a serious error,” said Dmitri Iglitzin, attorney for the political committee whose major donors were bp America and Amazon. But, he told commissioners, there was no “intent to deceive. It was the classic definition of a ministerial screw-up.”
Green Jobs PAC opposed Initiative 2117, which sought to repeal the Climate Commitment Act. That’s the state law that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by requiring companies and others to buy allowances for their air pollution. 
The repeal measure was the handiwork of Let’s Go Washington, a conservative political committee founded and funded by hedge fund manager Brian Heywood. In November, nearly 62% of voters rejected the initiative.
Green Jobs raised and spent $3.2 million during the campaign. Its largest donors were petroleum giant bp America, which gave $2 million, and Amazon, which put in $1 million.
It was one of four major committees that collectively shelled out $26 million to oppose the statewide measure.
Three weeks after the election, Let’s Go Washington filed a complaint alleging Green Jobs violated disclosure rules.
The commission investigation found that in mid-October, as campaigning crescendoed, the political committee spent nearly $1.1 million on mailings and commercials. But a report detailing the expenditures due Oct. 29 did not get filed until Nov. 13, days after the election. That was the major violation.
Staff also concluded Green Jobs did not provide requisite information on its sub-vendors and did not make clear on six monthly reports that its purpose was to oppose the initiative.
Assistant Attorney General Susie Giles-Klein told commissioners the violations were serious because they deprived voters of important information before the election. But she said there was no evidence the actions were intentional and noted the committee’s leaders amended the reports to comply without prompting from the commission.
The fine imposed Thursday is the same amount levied against Let’s Go Washington last fall after the commission concluded that the group failed to report spending by sub-vendors involved in gathering signatures for Initiative 2117 and five other statewide measures in 2023.
Before voting on the settlement with Green Jobs, Commissioner Douglass North voiced concern that the fine, while sizable, was becoming “a cost of doing business for large campaigns” whose employees should know how to follow the state’s campaign finance laws.
In recent months, the commission has fined Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW for late reporting of contributions to candidates and AARP for not disclosing contributions it received for its campaign against a statewide initiative to make a long-term care benefit program voluntary.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ballots-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 20:04:28.714674

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Republicans in the House and Senate narrowly passed the New Hampshire budget Thursday, overcoming weeks of disagreement with Gov. Kelly Ayotte over spending priorities and sending her an amended document that resolved some of her concerns.
The budget, passed in two bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, would spend $15.9 billion over two years, a $700 million increase from the last biennium. Republicans hailed it as a responsible reaction to a difficult environment for state business tax revenues. Yet it fell short of the spending Ayotte had originally proposed in February and reduced funding to some programs championed by Democrats. 
Ayotte praised the final package Thursday and said she would sign it.
“Today, we delivered on our promise by protecting our most vulnerable, creating an even brighter future for our children, and standing up for those who have made our state the safest in the nation,” Ayotte said. She raised the budget’s continued funding of Medicaid and the developmental disability waitlist, the “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban in schools, reforms to speed up state permitting of housing construction, and the universal expansion of education freedom accounts to all income levels. 
But Democrats condemned it, pointing to a series of “back-of-the-budget” cuts to state agencies and some layoffs, the introduction of premiums for Medicaid recipients, and the expansion of education freedom accounts, which they said were unnecessary and expensive.
“It raises costs on everyday Granite Staters while padding the pockets of the privileged few,” said House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson, at a press conference after the votes. 
The process laid bare some divisions among New Hampshire Republicans over fiscal policy at a time of tighter economic conditions. 
In order to head to Ayotte’s desk, the two-year spending agreement first had to overcome a challenge from a faction of conservative House Republicans that nearly doomed it. HB 1 was initially voted down by the House Thursday afternoon, prompting the body to pass a continuing resolution to keep government running, before it was resuscitated. The dissenting Republicans, led by Rep. Mike Belcher, of Wakefield, objected to the increases in state spending over the previous year’s biennium.
Other Republicans said it was the best package possible.
“This bill is too huge to please everybody,” said Rep. Ken Weyler, a Kingston Republican and the chairman of the House Finance Committee. “There’s things I don’t like in it. There’s things I love in it. That’s the way every budget bill has been in all of the 15 budget bills I’ve worked on.”

A pivotal compromise
The final budget agreement came after both chambers passed a compromise amendment designed to address concerns by Ayotte — and to smooth over a public disagreement between the governor and Senate President Sharon Carson. 
The compromise satisfies two out of three of the issues Ayotte raised last week, when she vowed to veto the budget if it weren’t changed. It restores funding to the Manchester School District for the next two years by pushing back the start date of a cap on that funding to 2027. It brings back much of Ayotte’s preferred changes to retirement benefits for a group of police officers and firefighters whose benefits were reduced in 2011 to address a deficit in the state’s pension fund.
Carson, who as a senator helped craft the 2011 change, argued it was a necessary reduction to move the retirement system toward solvency and prevent “spiking,” in which employees are incentivized to work more overtime in the final years of their career to boost their retirement income.
Ayotte said the change had shortchanged people who were relying on a certain level of retirement benefit and that those people should be made financially whole.
In the end, the compromise agreement included some provisions to prevent spiking while also improving benefits for those eligible by instituting a more generous calculation method for employees’ compensation. 
“Certainly, we all want to recognize the contribution our first responders make to the state,” Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican, said on the Senate floor. “But we also want to do it responsibly. I believe that this amendment accomplishes those goals.”
The compromise does not, however, take out a $51 million back-of-the-budget cut to the Department of Health and Human Services. That cut requires the commissioner of the department to choose which programs or personnel might be reduced or eliminated in order to adjust for the funding decrease, and it was one that Ayotte had opposed.
While the Senate passed the compromise bill easily, some in the House had qualms with the increase in spending for retirees. 
Speaking to his colleagues, Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican, sought to assuage those concerns. McGuire said that while he does not like the additional spending that goes to Group II in the compromise, he saw it as necessary to save the underlying budget, which he said was a good agreement.
“I prefer the Group II language in the committee of conference report on House Bill 2,” McGuire said. “But I know that in order for House Bill 2 as a whole to pass, this bill is going to have to pass as well, and House Bill 2 and House Bill 1 are $15 billion and lots and lots of policy. And this bill … it’s important, but it’s not everything.”

A rebellion over spending
Democrats raised a host of objections to the budget. They argued the Medicaid premiums amounted to an income tax on low-income families, that the budget did not send enough to public schools, and that it cut out potential funding to child care and affordable housing initiatives. 
“Granite Staters have asked us for housing, for child care, to lower their monthly health care bills and utility bills, and this budget does almost nothing for any of this,” said Senate Minority Leader Rebecca Perkins Kwoka at a press conference after the budget passed. “It’s going to make life less affordable in New Hampshire.”
Meanwhile, some of the sharpest disagreements within the House Republican caucus centered on accusations it spent too much. In a speech urging fiscal conservatives to vote down the budget, Belcher said the increasing spending would eventually lead to authoritarianism.
“Does this bill continue to increase spending another 7% over the last biennium, which itself was about a 20% increase over the one before it, inevitably spending us down over time toward that decline to tyranny? Yes, it does so,” Belcher said. 
House representatives initially voted down House Bill 1, the spending bill, 183-182. Anticipating the spending proposals to no longer be viable, the House also passed a continuing resolution that had been proposed by the Senate. 
Had that continuing resolution taken effect, state agencies would have been authorized to continue operating at 90 percent their current spending rates for the next six months. And lawmakers would be forced to negotiate through the summer on a new spending package.
Weyler, a fiscal conservative, urged his colleagues against that outcome, and said those on the right should not destroy the budget to achieve their aims.
“There were three things that I really wanted in the times I’ve spent in this Legislature,” he said. “Each of them took 10 years, and that’s what you have to do. You have to have patience and you have to have persistence. If there’s something you really want to get changed, it doesn’t happen the first time it’s filed. So if there’s something in this budget you didn’t like, don’t kill the budget over it.”

Their accounts raise potential legal questions about the government’s operation.,"The masked agents pull up quickly. They jump out of unmarked vans or trucks. They wear blue jeans or battle fatigues. They approach Latino men, at times yelling and carrying assault rifles. When someone runs, they’re taken. When they don’t answer a question, they’re taken. When they can’t produce papers, they’re taken. 
Their families won’t know what happened to them. They’ll be shackled, whisked away to another state, forced to subsist for days on potato chips, apples, water, and the occasional cold sandwich. They’ll sleep on the floor with mylar blankets, without access to showers or even working bathrooms. These are not enemy combatants in a war zone, but people living and working in America’s second largest city.
In the last three weeks, federal agents have swarmed Los Angeles County, rounding up 1,600 people where they work, where their children play, where they shop for food. They have driven entire families into hiding. Videos of these encounters, shared on social media, have offered quick, shaky glimpses of the chaos. 
But few details have emerged about what happens to those who are taken. CalMatters spoke with a number of men who were detained on the streets of Los Angeles during the first weekend of the raids. These are the stories three of them told about how they were arrested, how they were treated in government detention and, ultimately, how they were pressured to voluntarily leave the country. 
***
At 3:10 p.m. on Sunday, June 8,  Mauricio Oropeza was waiting for the 33 bus on the corner of Lincoln and Venice boulevards, in Santa Monica. He was headed back from his job cleaning apartment buildings for a maintenance company. It was a two-bus commute, and he was halfway home. 
There were a few other people – three men, a woman and her daughter – waiting for the same bus. No one seemed to know what to make of the truck that suddenly pulled up in front of them, or of the men in jeans and baseball caps that stepped out of the vehicle. One of them was holding a photo of a Latino man with the word “BUSCA” – Spanish for “WANTED” – printed across the top. 
“Have you seen this person?” he asked.  
When two of the commuters began to run, Oropeza did the same. That’s when several Border Patrol vehicles stopped in front of them, he said, and armed men in tactical gear jumped out. One of the agents tripped Oropeza and pinned him to the ground. 
“Don’t resist,” he told him.

The agents took his cell phone and Mexican passport. He was loaded onto one of the vehicles along with the other men from the bus stop, all of them struggling to adjust to their new reality. They would not be going home that night. They would not get to call their families to explain. 
As they drove away, the agents spotted two Latino men walking on the sidewalk. Oropeza said they got on their radio, said “two more,” and then another vehicle peeled off to pursue them. 
***
Less than two hours later and exactly a mile away, Omar Sanchez Lopez left his apartment on Rose Avenue and Lincoln Boulevard, in Venice, with his apron draped over his shoulder. He was on his way to work bussing tables at a nearby Italian restaurant when a Honda Civic pulled into the apartment complex parking lot. Lopez thought the driver, who was in jeans, t-shirt and baseball cap, was there to visit one of his neighbors. But then the man stepped out of the car and approached him. He was holding a piece of paper with photos of four Latino men, and he asked Lopez, in Spanish, “Do you know these people?” 
Lopez, 27, didn’t answer. But the man continued: “Do you speak English? Where do you work? How old are you? Are you a citizen? Do you have papers?”
When Lopez asked, “why are you asking me these questions,” the man pulled out his badge and said, “ICE.”
Lopez thought about turning around to go back inside, but a masked Border Patrol agent got out of the vehicle and told him to put his hands behind his back. Within minutes he was handcuffed and sitting in the back of the car.

“What are you doing in the United States?” he said the agent asked him as they drove away. “It’s not your country.”
Lopez didn’t answer. He looked out the window at the traffic as the sedan pulled him farther and farther away from his home, his family, his life. 
***
By the time Lopez and Oropeza were taken, Juan Flores Morales had been under arrest for more than 24 hours. He had been taking a lunch break on Saturday with three other men on his construction crew, eating a pizza outside the restaurant they were renovating in Inglewood, when masked Border Patrol agents rolled by in a truck.  
Morales felt, for an instant, as though he was paralyzed. “The fear is crazy,” he said. 
Then two agents got out of the vehicle, and Morales, 27, ran into the restaurant. He searched frantically for an escape, but a Border Patrol agent burst through the door and pinned him down.
“Tranquilo,” the agent told him. “Don’t move.”
They handcuffed him and asked whether he had participated in the immigration protests that had started the night before, following the first raids. 
“I don’t get involved in that,” he told them. “You got us at work. You got us while working.”
They took his cell phone, he said, and plugged it into a device that unlocked it, which allowed them to look through his contacts and communications.
Morales thought his lack of a criminal record would help him. But it didn’t. “I don’t know why they don’t want us in Los Angeles,” he thought.  
The agents drove him away, leaving his tools at the restaurant. 
***
Lopez, Oropeza and Morales are now in Chiapas, Mexico City and Puebla, respectively, and we spoke to them by phone. Their accounts of their arrests, detention, and rapid removal suggest federal agents are working from a new playbook, one that dispenses with the longstanding practice of targeted arrests and relies on only the thinnest pretext, like a wanted poster, for approaching people who appear Latino. 
In April, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring the Border Patrol from conducting warrantless raids in the Central Valley. “You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston said, finding the warrantless stops likely violated the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable searches.
The man who led that operation, El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, is now in charge of the operations across Los Angeles.

The men’s stories also suggest that agents are pushing people to sign removal forms before they can call home or speak with an attorney. Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law, said those tactics would be “blatantly illegal.”
“You can’t condition phone access on anything,” Arulanantham said. “They have a right to call their family. They have a right to call a lawyer.”
He also raised concerns about the treatment the men described in government facilities. “It’s not permissible to manipulate the conditions of detention to encourage people to give up their rights,” he said.
Migrants can challenge the legality of their arrest and detention, he said, but they usually have to be in the country and be able to call a lawyer. 
The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Immigration detention centers are well above capacity, and the men we spoke with were almost immediately moved to an ICE tent camp in Texas and, within days, across the border to an immigration facility in Ciudad Juárez. 
Before the Trump administration began its mass deportation campaign, many immigrants arrested away from the border were released on bond with a notice to appear in immigration court. Those with criminal histories were typically held in detention facilities. 
Now, Bovino has made clear, he considers anyone who crossed the border without documents – the farm worker, the day laborer, the paletero – a criminal. 
“Bad people,” he called them during a press conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this month. 
New Immigration and Customs Enforcement data from June 1 to June 10, analyzed by the Los Angeles Times, shows that 69 percent of the people detained in the LA area had never been convicted of a crime. 
A criminal records search in Los Angeles and the California state prison system for Oropeza, Lopez and Morales returned no results. Oropeza and Lopez said they had been caught at the border and deported years before.
***
From the bus stop on Venice Boulevard, Oropeza was taken to a parking lot in Santa Ana where the agents put him in shackles. He had chains on his wrists, his ankles, and around his waist. Then they loaded him onto another vehicle and drove him to a place he described as a kind of jail. There were no beds, he said, and everyone slept on the floor. Lopez and Morales were there as well. 
At 5 am the following day, all three were taken to an airfield near the Mojave Desert, where they boarded a plane to Texas with around 35 other men from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.

For the next few days, they were detained in an ICE tent camp in El Paso. Lopez said he was given a small bottle of water, potato chips and an apple. The cells were kept uncomfortably cold, he said, and the detainees were given only mylar blankets. When he asked to make a phone call, he was told he would need to share detailed information about the person he was calling – their name, address, place of work. He decided against it. 
He said the agents told him that if he tried to talk to an attorney, he would be stuck there, under the same conditions, for eight months to a year. On Wednesday, just two days after he arrived in El Paso, he agreed to sign the voluntary deportation papers.
“How they treated you there, I would rather leave,” he said. 
Oropeza signed the voluntary removal forms that day as well. Thirty minutes later, he was allowed to make his first call. 
“I have a family, I have to provide for them,” he said. “I didn’t want to be stuck there.” 
The next day, Lopez, Oropeza and Morales were driven across the border to Juárez, they said, along with dozens of other men from their cells who agreed to sign the forms. There, at a shelter set up by the Mexican government, they were able to shower, eat a hot meal and call their families.
They were also given 2,500 pesos – the equivalent of around $130 dollars – to make their way to somewhere else.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062625-Juan-Flores-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 20:04:28.714674

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Providence’s budgeting season won’t conclude in time for the July 1 start of the new fiscal year. But city officials have found a way to lessen the pain of increased taxes — at least for residents who own multifamily homes.
A revised fiscal 2026 budget seeks a proposed tax levy hike of 5.85% instead of the 7.5% proposed in April by Mayor Brett Smiley and the maximum cap of 8% authorized last week by the Rhode Island General Assembly. The change was announced Thursday by Providence City Council President Rachel Miller and Finance Chairwoman Helen Anthony after negotiating an agreement with Smiley.
The legislature had to get involved because state law caps municipal tax levy increases at 4% annually. Providence officials needed more than that to comply with a $15 million settlement last November between the city and the state education department over funding of the city’s public schools. About $11 million of that settlement needs to be accounted for in the 2026 budget, which is why Smiley proposed increasing the levy — and absorbing as much tax revenue as possible — to cushion the blow without affecting city services too severely. 
Smiley’s original proposed budget drew ire from residents and some Providence lawmakers, who argued it unevenly distributed tax rates, and would disproportionately affect small landlords more than commercial properties — the latter would still see a slight reduction in taxes under both versions of the budget.
“We heard residents loud and clear: protect city services and limit the impact of increased taxes, especially on those who can least afford it,” Anthony said in a statement. “Our negotiated agreement with Mayor Smiley does just that.” 
The revised budget reduces the average property tax increase on owner-occupied, multifamily homes from 16% to 6%, aligning it with the average increase for owner-occupied single-family homes. City officials estimate the revised structure would save property owners in this category about $400 on their tax bills, compared to the mayor’s original plan.
Tax bills delayed
Providence’s revised fiscal year 2026 budget is not yet finalized and is pending final approval by the City Council. A public hearing on the revised budget will be held Monday, June 30, at 5:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers. Spanish translation and free child care will be available. Residents can also submit written testimony by emailing the city clerk.  
Once the budget moves out the Finance Committee, it needs to pass the full City Council twice. The two votes are tentatively scheduled for July 7 and July 14. Until then, tax bills for the new fiscal year will be delayed, said Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for the mayor, in a Thursday email. 
“If FY26 property tax bills are not issued by mid-July the City will need to delay payments to vendors, grantees and the School District in order to fulfill the City’s debt service, payroll, medical and utility financial obligations,” Estrella wrote. “We have already delayed issuing $15M in pension payments and anticipate we will be unable to make the July PPSD appropriation on time.”
Both Smiley’s original proposal and the newly amended version actually lower tax rates across property types, but the readjusted rates are nullified by dramatic increases in property assessments during the recent revaluation.

“Revaluations are sky high and Providence is making up for decades of underfunding schools in just one year,” Miller said in a statement. “But that doesn’t mean working families should carry the burden. These revisions make the system fairer, protecting homeowners, renters, and small local landlords.”  
Non-owner-occupied properties with two to five units will still see the highest increase of all, at an average of 13% — a reduction of only 3%, compared to Smiley’s rendition of the budget.
Owner- and non-owner-occupied single-family homes will see a slight increase compared to Smiley’s plan, from 4% to 6%. 
“This was a very difficult budget to develop and an even more difficult budget to vet with financial uncertainties at the state level,” Smiley said in a statement Thursday, noting that he respected the City Council for helping to distribute the burden more evenly among the city’s residents. 
“Together we developed a streamlined, cost-effective budget that addresses the city’s severe budget shortfall and lessens the burden on our taxpayers,” Smiley continued. “As a result, I am happy to support a budget that underscores my administration’s continued commitment to responsible financial management while supporting the evolving needs of our neighbors.”
In addition to the levy bill passed by the General Assembly and signed by Gov. Dan McKee on Tuesday, state lawmakers also OK’d legislation with a more surgical approach to the city’s tax code: S1116, sponsored by Sen. Jake Bissaillon, and H6394, sponsored by  Rep. Rebecca Kislak.   
Unlike the blanket increase in property tax revenue, these bills allow for finer detail in how the city defines and taxes properties, allowing them to shift more of the burden onto commercial property owners. The city’s tax assessors will be allowed to target investor-owned or pricey industrial properties by breaking them off into separate categories.
The legislation does rely on the one-year levy cap exemption to absorb any extra revenue that would be generated, but its provisions for tax code are more lasting and could allow the city to more accurately target pricier properties in future taxation schemes. 
McKee allowed the legislation to become law, albeit without his signature, on Thursday.

States that choose to receive these funds would be required to pause enforcement of any laws or regulations related to AI models or systems. The enforcement ban would last 10 years.

According to the committee, the moratorium will prevent states from “hindering AI deployment through needless” regulation. 
Utah has passed a number of AI-related laws in the last two years, perhaps the most significant being SB149. Passed in 2024, the bill created the Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy, intended to be a regulatory sandbox where the private sector works with the state’s Department of Consumer Protection to identify ways in which AI can be used for good, and bad.
In 2025, lawmakers built on that initial law and passed HB452, which regulates mental health chatbots that use AI. Lawmakers also passed bills that regulate how police departments use AI in writing police reports; require upfront disclosure for AI chatbots that offer financial and legal advice; and target the use of AI in creating deepfakes or edited images that use a person’s name or image without their consent for commercial purposes. 
Utah lawmakers say the moratorium would effectively make these bills obsolete.  
“This federal moratorium would freeze this kind of forethinking work. It would prevent Utah and other states from responding to new developments, refining guardrails and learning through hands-on policy innovation,” said Rep. Doug Fiefia, R-Herriman. 
Deepfakes, policing, mental health and more: Lawmakers look to further regulate AI

Fiefia, a freshman lawmaker and former Google employee, worked on a number of tech-related bills during his first legislative session. Speaking during a press conference with other state lawmakers on Thursday, Fiefia said a 10-year moratorium could permanently handicap states’ ability to regulate AI. 
“That’s a lifetime in technology and would really hurt not only states and states’ rights to act, but at the end of the day, I think would hurt consumers,” he said. 
Fiefia is one of many Utah lawmakers and public officials who oppose the moratorium. Earlier this month, the Herriman representative penned a letter to Utah GOP Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis, asking them to oppose the provision in the budget bill. The letter was signed by most of the state House, including Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper. 
Utah Attorney General Derek Brown also signed on to a letter in May with dozens of other state attorneys general opposing the moratorium, calling the policy “wholly destructive.” 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox acknowledged the intent of the moratorium during his PBS news conference earlier this month, telling reporters that different regulatory approaches across 50 states could stifle the technology. But Utah’s laws, he said, are different. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“There’s this misunderstanding, I think, of what the Utah law does,” he said. “Our law does not impact the development of AI … this is just normal consumer protection.” 
Cox said he has concerns about the moratorium — he’s hoping Utah’s congressional delegation will create some kind of a carveout for laws that take a lighter touch to AI regulation. 
“Our hope is that the last version of this bill that passes, whatever that looks like, will allow for the kind of regulation that we’re doing in Utah and prevent the bad type of regulation that would stop AI from reaching its fullest potential,” he said.  
Sen. Heidi Balderree, R-Saratoga Springs, who also spoke during Thursday’s news conference, said the proposal goes against the idea of federalism. 
“I’m baffled how this even made it into the big, beautiful bill,” she said, noting that Utah’s AI bills mostly received unanimous approval. “In the state of Utah, this is a nonpartisan issue.” 
Balderree likened AI to a dam that’s about to burst — “a moratorium isn’t a reinforcement, it’s turning your back on the water and hoping it holds,” she said.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041025_UND-Capitol_27-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 19:05:24.226906

May 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Lancaster County District Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit seeking to void Nebraska’s medical cannabis laws on the grounds that they violate federal laws against marijuana.
Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong, in a 16-page opinion Thursday, ruled that John Kuehn, a former state senator and longtime marijuana opponent, could not prove injury to sue, the legal term of art known as “standing.” 
Strong, citing past case law, said such injury would need to be “concrete,” “distinct and palpable” and “actual or imminent.”
“Plaintiff admits that he has not suffered an injury-in-fact resulting from defendants’ actions, and the court finds that he lacks standing under any of the exceptions to the rule requiring an injury-in-fact,” Strong wrote.

Instead, Kuehn sought to get his foot in the courthouse door arguing that any Nebraskan should be able to challenge ballot measures (even after an election), that he has standing as a taxpayer to prevent the “illegal expenditure” of public funds and that he should have standing because the laws constitute a “matter of great publicconcern.”
Strong ruled against Kuehn on all three points.
More than 71% of Nebraskans approved legalizing medical cannabis, and 67% approved a regulatory system.
On the election-related challenge, Strong said Kuehn isn’t challenging the legal sufficiency of a ballot measure. Strong ruled over a separate Kuehn case last fall where she upheld the legality of the measures to legalize and regulate medical cannabis after Kuehn, and later top state officials, accused campaign workers of fraud and malfeasance. She rejected those claims.
“It is much too late to stop the secretary of state from putting the medical cannabis initiatives on the ballot,” Strong wrote.
Nebraska Supreme Court appeal pending
Kuehn had targeted Evnen and the trio of ballot sponsors of the 2024 medical cannabis campaign in the earlier case and again added them to this one.

Despite being a defendant, Evnen and his state attorneys, including Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, all but embraced Kuehn’s arguments and sought to overturn Evnen’s placing of the ballot measures on the 2024 ballot just months before. 
That earlier case, Kuehn v. Evnen et al., heads to the Nebraska Supreme Court this fall on appeals from Kuehn and Evnen.
This time around, Kuehn also targeted Gov. Jim Pillen, initially seeking to stop the governor from ceremoniously declaring the ballot measures successful. Strong did not let Kuehn do so, and Pillen certified the new laws, effective Dec. 12.
In January, Kuehn added CEO Steve Corsi of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, State Treasurer Tom Briese, Tax Commissioner Jim Kamm and the members of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that voters overwhelmingly approved creating in November to regulate the medication.

Among Kuehn’s main contentions in the federal preemption case was that Nebraska shouldn’t be able to create a medical cannabis program because of federal law classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug. A Schedule I drug is one that the federal government says has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical uses. A bipartisan swath of advocates has called for rescheduling the drug for decades. 
Nearly 40 states, including Nebraska, have laws on the books for medical cannabis.
‘A clear message’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, one of the three ballot sponsors targeted in the Kuehn cases, said she appreciated Strong’s “thoughtful decision.” She said the ruling “should send a clear message to the opposition that they have lost.”
Eggers said Strong’s dismissal upholds many years of hard work and hints “that we will finally see the day that we, and all Nebraskans, have fought for.”

Daniel Gutman, who represented the ballot sponsors in both Kuehn cases before Strong, said her order was consistent with other dismissals nationwide on procedural and substantive grounds.
“This is yet another failed attempt to undermine the will of Nebraska voters,” Gutman said in a statement.
The AG’s Office, representing all state defendants except for the Medical Cannabis Commission members, as well as a separate attorney representing the commission, declined to comment on the dismissal.
Kuehn’s attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.
An ‘exception’ vs. a ‘rule’
Strong called Kuehn’s allegations of “taxpayer standing” “remarkably broad,” ranging from allegations that Briese or Kamm would illegally be expending funds by collecting sales taxes on medical cannabis or by issuing guidance or investigating complaints against doctors who recommend cannabis. Medical cannabis would be sales tax exempt under current law. DHHS had not issued guidance or investigated complaints as of earlier this week.

Strong did say that Kuehn’s “strongest case” for taxpayer standing is against the commission itself, though Strong she noted none of the members are compensated for their duties and that the voter-approved laws did not give specific funds to the Medical Cannabis Commission. 
The Legislature set aside an additional $30,000 in spending authority for Liquor Control Commission employees who might take on joint duties with medical cannabis regulations. Strong’s ruling noted that the new state budget didn’t earmark any specific funding for the Medical Cannabis Commission.
Strong said that if “employee time” was enough for taxpayer standing, it would no longer be an “exception,” which attorneys for the Medical Cannabis Commission and ballot sponsors had argued.
“It would be the rule anytime a statute requires a government employee to do anything,” Strong wrote. “That result would be inconsistent with the principle that ‘[e]xceptions to the rule of standing must be carefully applied in order to prevent the exceptions from swallowing the rule.’”

On standing for a “matter of great public concern,” Strong said it’s unclear whether the Nebraska Supreme Court has applied the exception since it was created in 1979.
“If the proliferation of gambling and harm to the state’s natural resources are not matters of great public concern, then the court is hard-pressed to say that the legalization and regulation of medical cannabis is,” Strong wrote, citing cases from 2000 and 2015.
No shortage of ‘strong political opinions’
Strong said it is also relevant that other people could challenge the medical cannabis laws in court, one of which she said “obviously” is the federal government to enforce the federal Controlled Substances Act.
Nebraska commission approves emergency medical cannabis regulations

Others could sue, too, such as a landowner near a registered cannabis establishment if property valuation, use or enjoyment is impaired or someone fined by the Medical Cannabis Commission, Strong said.
Another party that has voiced intentions to sue if establishment licensing begins by an Oct. 1 deadline, as required under law, is the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Hilgers and his staff, including in this case, have repeatedly said they plan to sue if licensing begins, part of why his office supported dismissing Kuehn’s latest case.
Strong said she does not decide in the present lawsuit whether Hilgers and his office would have standing to challenge the medical cannabis laws.
“Nebraska, like other states, has no shortage of citizen-taxpayers with strong political opinions. That is not necessarily a bad thing,” Strong wrote. “But it would be bad if all those citizens could sue whenever a law requires a government employee to do something.”

The board voted Thursday to approve a joint agreement to resolve and dismiss lawsuits with two school districts that sued over similar transfer issues. 
Its agreement with Jenks Public Schools, which the district provided to Oklahoma Voice, states both parties agree the board’s decision is unenforceable because of a procedural error. 
Jenks and Bristow Public Schools filed nearly identical lawsuits after the state board voted June 27, 2024, to overrule the districts’ refusal to keep two boys enrolled as transfer students. About half of the board’s membership has changed since the decision.
Both students live outside of Jenks and Bristow boundaries. The districts denied the boys’ requests to continue as transfer students because of behavioral issues. 
State law allows districts to deny a transfer request for disciplinary reasons, as well as for poor attendance and because of a lack of school capacity.

The student attending Jenks High School had been suspended for possessing drugs on school property, the district’s lawsuit states. The Bristow student was arrested and suspended after claiming multiple times to have a bomb in his backpack while in a crowded classroom, according to court documents.
The families of both students appealed the denial to their local school boards and, when rejected again, raised the matter to the state Board of Education.
After speaking privately with district officials and the students’ families, the state board voted to uphold the students’ transfers to stay in Jenks and Bristow. Both districts contend the board’s “arbitrary and capricious” decision violated Oklahoma’s open transfer law and proper administrative procedures.
“Jenks Public Schools is pleased to reach this conclusion and will continue to act in accordance with the law regarding transfer applications and transfer appeals,” district spokesperson Rob Loeber said in a statement.
Bristow schools’ superintendent did not return requests for comment, nor has the district provided documents of its agreement.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who leads the state board, declined to comment on the details of Thursday’s vote until more documents are filed in court, but he acknowledged in a statement that “yes, there is an agreement in place to resolve those two lawsuits.” 
Jenks filed its dismissal agreement in Tulsa County District Court on Thursday, Loeber said.
It’s not immediately unclear whether Bristow’s has been filed in Creek County District Court. It’s also not clear where either student involved attended school over the past year while the cases were pending.

Members of Teamsters Local 728 in Cumming say their employer, Republic Services, is forcing them to work in dangerous conditions for too little pay. Along with Republic employees at several locations around the country, they’re demanding a new contract with better pay – 7% for the first year – and more benefits and protections. If they don’t get it, there could be a strike – which could mean trash piling up in metro Atlanta yards just as the summer heat is broiling the state.
The teamsters represent just under 400 Republic drivers in Georgia, according to Chuck Stiles, director of the Teamsters’ waste division. If a strike does take place, residential customers in Alpharetta will be the most affected.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists refuse and recyclable material collectors as the occupation with the third highest rate of fatal work injuries, below only fishing and hunting workers and roofers.
Sanitation workers say the risk often comes from faulty equipment, like trucks with brakes that don’t hold on hills or without functioning air conditioning in the sweltering heat. Stiles said if managers come in under budget for repairs, they get a portion of the money they didn’t spend, incentivizing them to put off necessary fixes.
Workers also have to deal with physical wear-and-tear from heavy lifting and repetitive motions as well as all sorts of hazardous refuse, from exploding paint cans to used needles and other medical waste.
“They look at workers no more than they look at a hydraulic hose or a tire,” Stiles said. “When it’s wore out, we’ll get another one. They don’t care about maintaining stability long term. It’s all about profit. If they hire a guy and he works six months and says ‘to hell with this, I’m out,’ they’re happy. They don’t care. They just keep churning. They keep churning workers.”
Charles David has been in the industry for 29 years and with Republic for 24, and he said the pay has not kept up with inflation.
“I live by myself and I go grocery shopping once, maybe twice a month and I spent $450 by myself. That’s one person,” David said. So if you got four people in the household, five people in the household, it gets rough, especially when it’s depending on one income.”
David said it’s even harder for younger workers just starting a family.
Stiles declined to comment on when a potential strike might come, though the Teamsters say it could be any day.
“It’s on the company. They’ll be the one that decides whether there’s a strike or not,” he said.
In a statement, Roman Blahoski, Republic’s director of external communications, said the company takes care of its workers and is negotiating in good faith.
“We have a best-in-class safety program and quickly address any concerns that may arise,” he said. “We respect the rights of our employees to engage in collective bargaining, and we will continue to meet with the union to reach a fair and competitive contract that is beneficial to our employees, our customers and our company.”

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin announced the settlement share Wednesday, and said the state would begin receiving the money next year. The annual payments will continue until 2040.
“I am pleased to see Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family held accountable for their actions that perpetuated the opioid crisis across the country, including here in Arkansas,” Griffin said in a press release. “These funds will further opioid abatement in Arkansas and will help provide treatment, research, and prevention.”
Arkansas receives first payment in $26 billion national opioid settlement

A third of the award will go to the state. The remaining funds will be evenly split between Arkansas municipalities and counties, and managed by the Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership.
Purdue Pharma is the producer of OxyContin, a painkiller that public health experts and government officials say was the catalyst for the broader opioid epidemic that began in the 1990s. The Sackler family is the owner of Purdue, but would be forced to give up their ownership under the settlement agreement.
The settlement is the latest in a years-long saga that started in 2019 when Purdue, facing thousands of lawsuits over OxyContin’s role in the epidemic, filed for bankruptcy protections. The agreement resolves these lawsuits, but does not shield the Sacklers from opioid lawsuits in the future. 
A previous settlement that included such protections was scuttled last year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the family couldn’t be protected by a settlement in bankruptcy court since the family itself hadn’t filed for bankruptcy.
Arkansas has the second-highest opioid dispensing rate in the nation, according to an Arkansas Department of Human Services report published in 2024. Arkansas’ rate was 72.2 per 100 people in 2022, according to the report. The national average was 46.8 per 100 people.
“Rates of opioid misuse in Arkansas were consistently in the top ten highest rates in the country among all age groups,” the report said. “4.1% of adults reported misusing opioids in the past year…Arkansas ranked 15th for individuals who reported being diagnosed with opioid use disorder in the past year.”
Particular disparities were noted in counties with greater income inequality, where “overdose death rates for Black individuals more than double those in counties with less income inequality,” according to the report.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)At least $100 million in federal grants have been canceled for North Dakota state agencies under the Trump administration so far, according to an analysis presented Thursday to state legislative leaders.
The analysis may not be a complete picture of the state impact, but it’s the first time such a list has been compiled since the Department of Government Efficiency began cutting costs.
“It is constantly changing and no guarantee that it is comprehensive,” Grant Gader, fiscal analyst for Legislative Council, said during a meeting of the Legislative Management Committee.
Health agencies scramble as North Dakota loses federal grants

The state Department of Health and Human Services has seen the bulk of the federal funding cuts with 12 grants that were canceled in March.
The agency lost about $69.5 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was awarded for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, vaccines for children and grants to address COVID-19 health disparities for underserved populations. 
Another $6.3 million in grants to address mental health and substance abuse also was canceled.
Those funding cuts have affected public health agencies and other organizations statewide.
The next largest cut was the loss of about $20 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency grants that were designated for various North Dakota infrastructure projects. Lawmakers during the session approved a Bank of North Dakota loan of about $9.7 million to fund wastewater projects in two communities after the grants were canceled.
The analysis, which Gader said comes from federal sources, shows about $8 million has been canceled for various state agencies as of this month, including:

$4.5 million to the state for digital equity planning and capacity
$2 million for the University of North Dakota for a school safety grant
$990,000 for the Department of Environmental Quality for radon awareness, testing and mitigation to reduce radon impacts to low-income homes
$580,000 to the Department of Agriculture for local food purchase agreements
$105,000 National Institute of Health grant to UND for an undergraduate training initiative

Gader said his analysis does not include federal grants awarded directly to local agencies.

Also this week, the Budget Section of the Legislature approved spending nearly $190,000 in contingency funds to cover an education-related grant that was no longer available after the funds had been spent.
The dollars were part of Governor’s Emergency Education Relief funding authorized by Congress through the COVID-19 stimulus package. It supported initiatives such as the North Dakota Commission on Juvenile Justice and the Teacher Retention and Recruitment Task Force. 
The deadline to spend the funds was extended through March, but the state was notified in March that the funds were not available, said Joe Morrissette, director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
“We’re somewhat of a victim here of the federal Department of Government Efficiency efforts,” he said.
Morrissette told lawmakers Thursday that staff tried repeatedly to get in touch with the U.S. Department of Education to inquire about the grant, but they usually received responses that the employee no longer worked at the department.
“So, we have not gotten any resolution from the feds on this and as we get close to the end of the biennium now, we’re a little bit stuck in how we handle this,” Morrissette said. 
Lawmakers on Thursday asked the Office of Management and Budget to also start tracking federal funding cuts. There’s a possibility lawmakers could reconvene in a special session to consider state funding to replace lost federal dollars.
“We’re going to need a big picture,” said Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
Hogan also asked legislative staff to research more details about the impact of the funding cuts.
“If you cut $75 million, somebody’s going to be impacted by that,” Hogan said. “And I don’t think we know exactly who that is yet.”
Lawmakers also are preparing for a state impact from the “big, beautiful bill” under consideration in Congress.
North Dakota could lose about $1.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding over 10 years, if the U.S. House version of the legislation is signed into law, according to a Legislative Council memo presented Thursday. Medicaid enrollment in North Dakota would be reduced by an estimated 18% by 2034, with some of the reduction attributed to mandatory work requirements.
The memo analyzed reports issued on the bill by the Congressional Budget Office and the Kaiser Family Foundation. The analysis does not take into account changes to the bill as it’s being debated in the Senate.
The bill as approved by the House also would force states to contribute to a cost-sharing formula for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beginning in 2028. Under current law, the federal government pays the benefits for the program and states only cover the program’s administrative costs. 
The North Dakota impact of that legislation is unclear as the details are still being debated. Legislative Council projects that the state would have to pay an additional $18 million every two years to administer the program. However, that doesn’t take into account changes to the program that may require additional staff to implement.
Donna Aukland, chief financial officer for the state Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers the agency may have to hire additional people or delay other work to accommodate the new eligibility requirements for federal programs.
Lawmakers saved six legislative days of the 80-day limit in case they need to reconvene to address impacts of federal funding cuts. 
“This is something we need to keep our eye on,” Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said. “I suspect when the final ‘big, beautiful bill’ project emerges, there will be more updates.”

The Vermont Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in the appeal of Aita Gurung, who was found guilty by a jury following a trial of first-degree murder and attempted murder stemming from the 2017 attack at his home.

The attorney for a Burlington man sentenced to serve at least 27 years in prison for killing his wife and seriously injuring her mother with a meat cleaver in 2017 argued Thursday that the convictions for murder and attempted murder against him should be thrown out. 
Rebecca Turner, a public defender for Aita Gurung, contended during an hourlong hearing before the Vermont Supreme Court that the jury selection process in her client’s trial was flawed.
Turner also told the five justices that the trial court’s interpreter who provided Nepali translation throughout the trial for Gurung, who is Bhutanese, did not adequately perform that service. 
“The right to challenge prospective jurors runs deep in our common law tradition,” Turner said at the start of her roughly 30 minutes of arguments. “As our United States Supreme Court has confirmed in the late 1800s, it is a necessary part to ensure fairness of a jury trial.” 
Turner told the justices that during the jury selection process leading up to the trial in 2022, Judge John Pacht held a portion of the proceedings — in which attorneys raised concerns about certain jurors being assigned to the case — in his chamber, away from public view.

“Mr. Gurung, without explanation, was excluded, as were the public,” Turner said, adding that the alleged errors violated her client’s rights to an open and fair jury selection process and warranted a reversal of his convictions.  
Assistant Attorney General Sophie Stratton, one of the prosecutors in the case, countered in her argument to the justices Thursday that the issue did not meet the standard requiring the tossing out Gurung’s convictions.
Stratton said that Gurung’s defense team during the trial did not object to that portion of the jury selection process taking place outside of the courtroom. 
Additionally, Stratton said that the part of jury selection that took place in the judge’s chambers was limited to about 90 minutes out of the entire roughly four-day process it took to seat in the jury in the case. 
Gurung was found guilty by a jury in November 2022 of first-degree murder in the death of his 32-year-old wife, Yogeswari Khadka, at their home in Burlington on Oct. 12, 2017. He was also found guilty of attempted second-degree murder for seriously injuring his mother-in-law, Thulsa Rimal, in the same attack.
Pacht later sentenced Gurung to 35 years to life, with 27 years to serve and the remainder suspended on probation.
Gurung’s mental health has played a critical role in the case. 
In 2019, Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George dropped the charges against Gurung, as well as two other defendants in high-profile cases, when she said she could not rebut insanity defenses based on expert opinions.
Gov. Phil Scott called on then-Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan to review each of the cases, and the state’s top prosecutor refiled charges in all three cases, including the one against Gurung.
During Gurung’s trial, his defense attorneys argued that he was not guilty because he was insane at the time of the attacks on his wife and her mother. 
The prosecution disputed that contention, maintaining it was a case of domestic violence, saying Gurung was fueled by anger after his wife would not get him a beer.
Despite rejecting the insanity defense and finding Gurung guilty of the charges against him, following the verdict nine of the 12 jurors signed a letter to the judge stating that it was their unanimous opinion that his mental condition significantly influenced the events leading to the charges against him.
Turner, one of Gurung’s appeal attorneys, cited during Thursday’s appeal hearing several other reasons why her client’s convictions should be thrown out in addition to flaws she alleged in the jury selection process.
Among those reasons, Turner pointed to the court’s Napali interpreter who translated the trial as it was happening to Gurung, who listened to the interpreter’s voice through headphones.
Turner said the issue with the court interpreter during the trial was raised by Gurung’s attorneys with the judge during that proceeding.
“The counsel told the court that the interpreter was not completing sentences, missing entire sentences, putting words together that are not exact,” Turner said. 
In addition, Turner said, the interpreter included English words in the Nepali translation for legal terms, such as “defense” and “testimony.” 
“When the trial court heard these concerns, the trial court was hostile and immediately dismissive,” Turner said. 
The Vermont Supreme Court took the arguments Thursday under advisement and are expected to issue a written opinion. The justices gave no timeline for when that decision would be issued. 
Gurung, 42, is serving his prison sentence at the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield.

The 105-page plan submitted by Hazelett Strip-Casting Corporation outlines five “cottage-style” buildings for “a 20-room inn” with a restaurant and event space at the lakefront site of a former motel.

An $8 million lakefront proposal for a hotel with a fitness center, restaurant and event space currently under town review has some Colchester residents concerned.
Named The H at Malletts Bay, the development would be out of scale for the area and could exacerbate traffic and environmental issues on West Lakeshore Drive, residents said at a packed Development Review Board public hearing June 11 that ran almost four hours. 
“Any development on the water’s edge will cause more damage to the bay. It’s just common sense. Any development like this will increase traffic problems on West Lake Shore Drive. Any development like this will negatively affect our visual access to the bay,” said resident Jeff Spengler at the meeting.
Nothing like it exists anywhere on the bay, resident Kelly Baker wrote in an email to VTDigger this week. She is particularly concerned about the project’s potential impact on the water quality of Malletts Bay and fears it would change the look and feel of that scenic stretch.
Others told VTDigger they were not aware of or didn’t grasp the scale of the development planned at the site until recently.
“I only learned of this proposed development by chance. Very few people know what’s going on, even now,” said resident Jeanne Welch, adding that the amount of information filed so far is “daunting.”
The 105-page site plan submitted by Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp. outlines five “cottage-style” buildings for “a 20-room inn” (plus a manager’s room), a standalone rental building, a 48-seat restaurant and a 60-person event space at 166 and 180 West Lakeshore Drive.
The project plan includes a 1,536-square-foot maintenance building and a 67-space parking lot at 135 West Lakeshore Drive across the street. It also has space for a future building that could sleep six to be approved in a separate process.
Built on a slope, the buildings would appear as two stories from the road and three stories from the bay side. The main building would include a restaurant on the lower level, an event space on the ground floor and a fitness spa on the top level, according to consultants that represented the plan for the developer at the meeting.

The town board is reviewing the application for the proposed  plan — which is about the mid-stage of the review process. The developer “updated the submission extensively” since April 9, said Zachary Maia, development manager for the town, by adding a new building, a fire hydrant and adjusting shoreland encroachment, among other changes.
Because the developer added “critical review items” late on the day of the meeting, town officials had not had the time to review it, he said at the meeting.
Benjamin Avery, principal at Greenfield Growth Consulting LLC (and formerly a developer with Black Rock), who represented the developer with a team of four other consultants, gave a brief overview of the changes.
He said they addressed some of the town’s concerns from the last hearing such as reducing some encroachment items, realigning the “cottages” and adding the fifth building “just so the project you’re reviewing is in its totality.”
“Where the alignment of the original five buildings has moved around, those buildings have not changed from an elevation standpoint,” Avery said.
Growing concerns
About 45 residents packed the continued public hearing on June 11 and questioned consultants about the height, density, stormwater and wastewater capacity and took issue with a filed winter day traffic study that does not account for summer vehicular traffic nor bicycle or pedestrian traffic.
“Why wasn’t a study done in the summer?” resident Julie Collins said.  “As it is now, it’s hard to get home in the summer with all the campers and the boaters and the swimmers.”
Jennifer Conley, director of transportation in Vermont for VHB, an engineer and planning firm, said they added new counts from April, in addition to the ones submitted from January. They “followed the typical steps of a traffic study,” considered peak times and provided a conservative analysis, she said.
Tom Berry said he would like to know more about the new easement set aside for the bike path.
“I think it’s the most significantly needed piece of infrastructure in Colchester right now and what’s, you know, probably the most dangerous piece of road for a bicyclist between Colchester village and downtown Burlington.”
While the plan may meet regulations for the amount of stormwater that must be treated for the size of the project, it would still allow untreated water to flow directly into the bay, according to Baker. 
“I’m also concerned about wastewater,” she wrote. “They are accounting for the minimal amount of numbers in their projection.”
She said she believes the new building has been counted as one unit when it is a two-bedroom addition that could easily house six or more. 
“That is a big discrepancy as far as the amount of waste water that could be created from just that space alone,” she wrote in the email.
Consultants at the meeting said they have provided accounts of the wastewater capacity for the project which meet the town’s limits for the parcel. Board members said it amounts to a little over 4,000 gallons per day.
Several residents have submitted letters to the review board since the meeting, outlining their growing concerns regarding the proposed development.
“In no way does the proposed development of five large buildings along the lake in the small area preserve or enhance views of the bay,” Faith Brown wrote to the Development Review Board, referring to language in the 2019 Town Plan that serves as a guiding document for land use. “Driving by people will see the buildings and be bothered by the foot traffic across the road to those buildings, not enjoying the magnificent views of the bay.”
The developer is looking to merge two lots. Several residents at the meeting expressed concerns that that would allow more intense development on the merged parcel.
“For instance, sidewalk setbacks would go away. They’d be able to build a building right on top of the property line,” said John Louchheim. “So my question for the development review board is, in light of the 2019 town plan, why would you approve that murder of the parcels that’s going to increase development?”
The property owned by the developer currently has a marina and recreational space for Hazelett employees that would remain after the proposed buildout. Residents wondered if it would expand in use as a commercial marina once the development is approved, and whether moorings would be used by guests or available to the public.Resident Jeanette Berry asked in an email to the board whether the use of the marina, which has historically operated as a small private facility for Hazelett employees and become “essentially a commercial marina,” would be reviewed for compliance in light of the project.
Some residents criticized language used by the developer to describe what they said looks like a resort-style hotel that belongs in a city rather than an “inn” with “cottages” in a bedroom community. They wondered how much access the public would have.
Consultants at the meeting said the marina would remain as it is, the restaurant would be open to the public, the rooms and meeting space would be up for rent and the spa would be available for guests only. They offered no details about marina use nor cost estimates of what bookings could cost.

Residents have also expressed concern the proposed development could circumvent local regulations.
“It would behoove the town to close these loopholes that are being exploited,” Welch wrote in an email to the Development Review Board.
“It’s already a David and Goliath situation: developers with the will, unlimited financial resources, time and manpower deluging a very capable yet understaffed small town planning and zoning with 100+ page applications,” Welch wrote. “Just tell them if it’s not in the regs they can’t do it!”
Some residents said they are worried the details are murky.
The developer’s filing estimated 47 sleeping spaces in the rooms, 48 seats in the restaurant, 69 in the spa and meeting space for an estimated total of at least 164 people at capacity plus six more in future for the sixth building planned.
“By blending modern hospitality offerings with a deep respect for the natural landscape, ‘The H’ is poised to bring fresh energy, innovation, and year-round activity to this iconic waterfront location,” the filing reads.
The public hearing will continue on July 23 at 7 p.m. If approved by the town, the project would also have to pass the Act 250 process that governs statewide development review.

[…]","A Pennsylvania mail ballot envelope (Capital-Star photo)A federal judge sentenced a Delaware County elected official who admitted his role in an ultimately unsuccessful scheme to steal a mayoral election to nearly two years in prison.
Sentencing for Md Munsur Ali, 48, of Millbourne came about a week after U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III sentenced his two co-conspirators to federal prison.
In addition to 21 months behind bars, Bartle ordered Ali to serve a year of supervised release and pay a $2,500 special assessment. Ali, who remains a member of Millbourne Council, pleaded guilty in April to 25 charges against him — one count of conspiracy, 12 counts of giving false information in registering to vote, and 12 counts of fraudulent voter registration.
According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia, Ali and co-conspirators Md Nurul Hasan, 48, and Md Rafikul Islam, 52, also of Millbourne, agreed to fraudulently submit write-in votes to elect Hasan mayor, after he was knocked out of contention in the 2021 Democratic primary election. Hasan and Islam also pleaded guilty in April.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bartle sentenced Hasan, the former council vice president, to three years behind bars and Islam, a former member of council, to one year in prison.
“These defendants sabotaged the democratic will of their fellow citizens in deciding Millbourne’s next mayor,” U.S. Attorney David Metcalf said. “Public trust in the electoral process is critical, and my office is committed to ensuring that our elections remain free and fair. As this case shows, should we find instances of fraud, we won’t hesitate to prosecute those responsible.”
Hasan also faces prosecution in Delaware County Court for 16 counts each of unlawful voting, voting fraud and obstruction of government.
“Free and fair elections are the bedrock principle that defines American democracy. I appreciate the partnership between my office, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to bring these criminals to justice,” Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said in a statement.
The investigation began after the winner of the race, Mayor Mahabubul A. Tayub raised concerns about non-residents who had registered to vote in Millbourne before the election, Stollsteimer said.
Stollsteimer said in March that his office has investigated and filed charges in four election fraud cases since he took office in 2020.
“In each case the fraud was aided by failures in our current election system,” Stollsteimer said. “I understand the desire to allow people easy access to participate in our democracy through the use of modern technology, but in my opinion our legislature should be putting safeguards in place to address the issues raised in these prosecutions.”
According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office: After his 2021 primary loss, Hasan decided he would run for mayor as a write-in candidate in the November election. Ali and Islam agreed to support him, prosecutors said. 
To do this, all three worked to obtain the personal information of people who did not live in Millbourne and used it to fraudulently register them to vote in the borough at various addresses using the commonwealth’s online voter-registration system, prosecutors said.
They then used the voter registration website to request vote-by-mail ballots that were sent to the addresses used to create the fraudulent voter registrations. Hasan, Islam and Ali retrieved the mail-in ballots from mailboxes at the addresses, completed them with write-in votes for Hasan and returned them to the county board of elections to be counted, prosecutors said.

Hasan and Ali persuaded acquaintances who lived outside Millbourne to provide their personal information to carry out the fraud and assured them they would not get into trouble if they didn’t try to vote anywhere else. They also obtained personal information from other sources, including Hasan’s business, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. 
Islam allowed Hasan to use his email addresses to submit fraudulent voter registrations and request ballots through the state website.
In total, Hasan, Ali and Islam conspired to falsely register and submit ballots for nearly three dozen non-Millbourne residents as Millbourne voters. Hasan lost the election by a vote of 165-138, prosecutors said.

Through a press release, Ruud expressed deep appreciation for the Carroll community and said he was grateful for the warm welcome and support he received throughout the search process. However, he is “stepping away to focus on personal matters that will require his full time and attention.”
Carroll College’s 18th president, John Cech, retired at the end of the school year.
The Carroll College Board of Trustees has appointed Jennifer Glowienka, Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, and Bishop Austin Vetter, Bishop of the Diocese of Helena, to serve as interim co-presidents for the 2025–26 academic year.
“Carroll is entering a new chapter,” said Rev. Patrick Beretta, Chairman of the Carroll College Board of Trustees. “Dr. Glowienka and Bishop Vetter offer strong, complementary leadership and a deep understanding of our mission. This is a pivotal time for the institution, and their combined experience positions us well to meet the challenges ahead. We are confident in their ability to lead Carroll with clarity, compassion and strategic focus.”
The co-presidency model, college leaders said, reflects Carroll’s commitment to collaborative leadership, institutional stability, and thoughtful stewardship during a year of significant institutional work.
Carroll College said it will provide further updates in the future, including developments related to presidential leadership beyond the interim period.
According to the release, in the year ahead, Carroll College will remain focused on strengthening academic excellence, advancing financial sustainability, and supporting long-term accreditation goals.
Glowienka has served in her current position since July 2021. A member of the Carroll faculty since 2003, Glowienka brings over two decades of experience in academic leadership and teaching. She holds a doctorate in evolutionary botany from the University of Colorado at Boulder and a bachelor’s degree in biology from Boise State University. Her previous roles at Carroll include Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs, Assistant Dean of Instruction, and Chairwoman of the Department of Life and Environmental Sciences. She was named the James J. Manion Endowed Chair in the Biological Sciences in 2018 and received Carroll’s Distinguished Scholar Award in 2008.  Glowienka has helped secure more than $1.5 million in external grants, served as the college’s accreditation liaison officer, and remains deeply committed to Carroll’s Catholic, liberal arts mission.
Vetter has been the Bishop of Helena since 2019. He earned a bachelor’s in Philosophy from Cardinal Muench Seminary and continued his theological studies at the Pontifical North American College and the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. Ordained a priest in 1993, he has served in numerous leadership roles, including Rector of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Bismarck and Director of Spiritual Formation at the Pontifical North American College in Rome (2012–2018).

Miguel Angel Lozada-Dominguez, 36, pleaded guilty in May 2025 to one count of illegal reentry.
According to a Wednesday U.S. Attorney’s office press release, law enforcement made contact with Lozada-Dominguez in St. Regis in April.
In court documents, the government alleged that Lozada-Dominguez appeared to be soliciting money from individuals while holding a notebook with handwritten phrases in English. He told officers he was a Mexican citizen and did not possess valid immigration documents and had no legal authorization to enter the country.
Law enforcement arrested Lozada-Dominguez who later stated he had entered the United States by crossing the border undetected through Del Rio, Texas.
Lozada-Dominguez’s records showed he was convicted for illegal entry and ordered removed from the U.S. in 2019, and he did not seek or receive authorization from the Attorney General to reenter the United States.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association. (States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector)

The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.”
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”


Moran’s communications director, Angela Lingg, said “the Senate is continuing to negotiate any changes to Medicaid, and Sen. Moran is working to make certain Kansas hospitals are at the forefront of those discussions.”


Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.”
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.”
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association president and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients.
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation.
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent.
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.”
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”

(Photo via U.S. Bureau of Reclamation)Just a little more than 12 months ago, the huge St Mary Siphon, more than a century old, which delivers water to thousands of ranchers and residents along Montana’s Hi-Line and eastern part of the state failed. On Wednesday, the United States Bureau of Reclamation announced the reconstruction project had been completed, thanks to an expedited review process by all levels of government, and emergency funding from Congress.
Montana’s senior Senator, Steve Daines, cheered the completion.
“The St. Mary Siphon provides vital water to Montana communities along the Hi-Line, and the failures last summer were catastrophic. I’m beyond thrilled to hear that Reclamation has completed repairs on the siphons and is resuming operations on the Milk River Project,” Daines said.
The siphon, is one of three siphons along the St. Mary Canal which diverts water from the St. Mary River to the Milk River  delivers a supply to more than 110,000 acres of farmland and municipalities across Montana.
“Getting this siphon back online within a year is a remarkable accomplishment and a reflection of our commitment to the people who rely on this water every day,” said Montana Area Office Manager Ryan Newman. “Reclamation, working shoulder to shoulder with the Joint Board, the Blackfeet Nation, and the State of Montana, ensured this project remained on track under extraordinary circumstances.”
The “catastrophic failure” of the siphon happened on June 17, 2024, and jeopardized the farmland as well as 18,000 people who rely on the system for water. Without the siphon and water supply, the Milk River would run dry six out of every 10 years.
Jennifer Patrick, project manager for the Milk River Joint Board of Control, had originally estimated the project at more than $70 million, and said the board was hopeful that a new siphon would be operational by Fall 2025. Despite a brutally harsh winter, which included temperatures dipping farther than -20 Fahrenheit, work continued ahead-of-schedule throughout the project.

“Bringing water back through the St. Mary Canal isn’t just a milestone—it’s a testament to what can be accomplished through strong partnerships and relentless hard work. The teams from Sletten Construction, NW Construction, and Pro-Pipe, with support from the Blackfeet Tribal Employment Office, have been nothing short of amazing. This project reflects what’s possible when local, state, Tribal, and federal partners come together with urgency and purpose to protect a lifeline of the Hi-Line,” Patrick said.
Though it has been called the “St. Mary Siphon,” the system is really two separate siphons, St. Mary and the Hall Coulee Siphon.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association. (Photos by States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector)The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.” 
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”
Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.” 
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.” 
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association President and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients. 
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation. 
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent. 
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.” 
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BeshearKelly16x9-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-26 18:14:00.270234

(Photo courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s key vaccine panel has voted 5-1 to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, in what critics say is a nod to vaccine skeptics who have fixated on the chemical’s use. 
The move rescinds recommendations for flu vaccines containing thimerosal for children, pregnant women, and the general public. The CDC’s research shows no adverse impacts caused by the chemical.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted 5-2 to approve a monoclonal antibody shot manufactured by Merck to protect infants younger than eight months from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 7-0 to add RSV to a program that provides free vaccines to children whose families can’t afford them, and 6-0 to approve the annual flu vaccine for everyone older than six months.
The committee, which was established in 1964, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations also play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible immunizations are for the public to access. They also help guide global immunization practices.
This week’s meeting is ACIP’s first since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, several of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.

Though certain members of the committee have embraced the label of anti-vaxxer, committee Chair Martin Kulldorff has objected to the characterization, and emphasized the need to build public confidence in the CDC’s recommendations. 
“Our central duty is to protect public health, and we understand that we must answer the call for re-establishing confidence in the scientific examination process,” the committee members said in a joint statement. 
“We came to this meeting with no predetermined ideas, and will make judgments as if we are treating our own families.”
The votes also offered insights into individual members of the committee’s stance on vaccines. Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of Medicine who has served as a past committee member, cast the sole “no” vote on the thimerosal ban. 
“The risk from influenza is so much greater than the nonexistent, as far as I know, risk from thimerosal,” he said.
Vicky Pebsworth, a registered nurse and board member of the National Vaccine Information Center, which advocates for vaccine exemptions, abstained from voting.
A controversial ingredient
Thimerosal, a mercury-derived antiseptic, has been used since the 1930s to guard against harmful fungi and bacteria in vaccines. The chemical was removed from all childhood vaccines in the U.S. by 2001 and today, only 4% of flu vaccines administered — those used in multi-dose vials — contain the compound. However, antivaccine activists have seized on thimerosal, citing unfounded arguments that link the chemical to autism and other adverse health outcomes.
Thursday’s vote to ban thimerosal from flu shots came shortly after Lyn Redwood, the former head of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, delivered a presentation to the committee centered on the ingredient. Redwood, who has long echoed conspiracy theories about vaccines, was recently hired by Kennedy to help oversee vaccine safety at the CDC, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services directory now lists Redwood as an employee.
Redwood’s presentation argued that thimerosal has been shown to cause autism, though there is no scientific evidence to support the claim. An early draft of her slides claiming that thimerosal can cause “long-term consequences in the brain,” cited a study that does not appear to exist. The draft was later removed and replaced with a version that does not include the fabricated citation.
The CDC’s own research has shown no connection between thimerosal and autism or any other potential harm. The chemical is not frequently used in U.S.-administered vaccines, but remains common in most vaccines around the world.
Jodie Guest, who serves as the senior vice chair of Emory University’s epidemiology department and as a faculty member on the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program, criticized the committee’s emphasis on “revisiting settled science” in an effort to appease vaccine skeptics.
“Revisiting [thimerosal] and taking it out of the very few vaccines that’s left in is really scientifically not a huge problem,” Guest said. “But from a communication perspective, it continues to propagate the concept that there is a relationship between it and neurological disorders.”
There are certain situations in which using a vaccine that contains thimerosal may be a more practical choice, Guest said. Multi-vial doses of vaccines are cheaper to produce, and are more likely to be used in rural areas where vaccines are administered less frequently. 
“Our underserved communities are the places where we are more likely to see the multi-dose vials for the flu vaccine, and that’s where thimerosal still exists,” Guest said. “It was put into multi-dose vials in order to not have bacterial infections inside of the vaccine vials that were then given to patients. So it’s a protection and it’s scientifically sound to continue to use it.”
Georgia, which has a large rural population, rural health care shortages and low vaccination rates, could be disproportionately impacted by any messaging that casts doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, Guest added.
“Anything that makes it harder to find a flu vaccine or to get one — or makes you question how safe they are — will drive our numbers down,” she said.

Court filings in Gardener’s Supply Co.’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case reveal how a combination of its employee-ownership model and ill-timed investments following a surge in Covid-19-era profits ultimately led to the company’s financial collapse. They also paint an uncertain picture for the future of its employee ownership and ability to repay mounting debts.The documents trace the decline of Gardener’s to what had once been a banner period for the Vermont-based gardening company — the pandemic. Like many companies in the home and garden sector, Gardener’s saw a dramatic boost in sales as Americans took up gardening during lockdown. The company reported “significant sales and growth” in 2020, 2021 and 2022, with revenues hitting $110.3 million in 2021 and $105.4 million in 2022. The boom benefited the business and employees, whose stock values “skyrocketed,” according to the court filings. However, Gardener’s was unable to maintain this financial bloom. The company’s revenue dropped to $89.6 million in 2023 and $71.5 million in 2024 as the gardening trend wilted. These losses in revenue were compounded by several factors.

Firstly, longtime employees who had enjoyed lengthy tenures at Gardener’s retired and cashed out their employee stock. This meant the company had to pay out a five-year retirement plan for the employees who had left when stock values hit record highs, causing “significant liquidity issues” and damaging its “future projections to pay out the retirement obligations in coming years,” the filings stated. Gardener’s employee stock ownership plan is also expensive to maintain — it’s managed by an outside trust, and incurs “higher than typical annual reporting, compliance, valuation and audit costs.”Secondly, the company made a series of poor investments. Gardener’s spent heavily on  “numerous one-time systems and process improvement[s],” including a $500,000 enterprise resource system — a software suite designed to streamline business operations. But the implementation did “not go smoothly,” court records indicate. Issues with the system ended up costing the company between $5 million and $10 million in revenue.Gardener’s also invested in a new Warehouse Management System that led to significantly delayed deliveries during the company’s peak spring season. More than 60% of customer orders in May 2024 were delayed by 15 to 30 days, according to the filings.These problems lead to Gardener’s falling out of compliance with its lender, Bank of America, which provided the company’s credit line. Gardener’s entered an agreement with the bank to delay loan payments until the second quarter of 2024, and reshuffled leadership in an effort to stay afloat.
But the changes were unsuccessful. Bank of America offered a final loan extension set to expire on June 29, and ultimately ended its relationship with the company. According to court documents, the bank’s analysts noted that “cash generated during the Pandemic surge—when AGR’s [America’s Gardening Resource] ESOP-fueled share price tripled—was primarily paid out as equity to shareholders,” in reference to Gardener’s employee stock ownership plan.The company then launched a “series of strategic actions” to stabilize operations, including staff layoffs, hiring a new marketing firm and making changes to its shipping partnerships. These actions failed as well, and it “became clear” to Gardener’s leadership that the way forward “was to engage in a sale process,” the bankruptcy filing states. Gardener’s engaged the investment bank Tower Partners, which reached out to 1,115 potential buyers.Competitor Gardens Alive Inc. is now poised to purchase the Gardener’s assets for $9 million. Notably absent from the deal, however, is the employee stock ownership plan.Gardener’s ESOP trust owns the company’s stock, with employees as the beneficiaries. Since filing for bankruptcy, Gardener’s has stopped making contributions to the trust, citing its “current financial condition.” It remains unclear whether there will be any money left in the trust for current or retired employees after the deal closes.“If the company is sold … [the ESOP] is basically a plan that has no assets and gets wound down,” said Matt Cropp, executive director of the Vermont Employee Ownership Center.It’s also unclear whether Gardener’s has the money to repay most of its creditors. As it stands, the company owes over $4.5 million to 30 unsecured creditors — creditors without collateral — including four Vermont vendors. 
A Gardener’s spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on the future of the ESOP and whether the company would be able to pay back its creditors.“It goes secured debt, administrative debt, and then unsecured debt. So, [unsecured creditors] get whatever’s left over,” said Christopher M. Condon, an adjunct bankruptcy and corporate law professor at Vermont Law and Graduate School.Gardener’s currently has just $4.2 million on hand and owes $8.2 million to banks, according to court documents.Condon said there’s a chance the unsecured creditors could recoup their money if it is found  Gardener’s owes less than anticipated as the bankruptcy case continues.
“The numbers aren’t necessarily accurate on day one because the books and records change all the time. It depends on when you get the invoice, what the billing cycle is, all that stuff,” he said.Another buyer could also emerge and submit a higher bid for the company’s assets, increasing the pool of money available to pay back creditors.“It’s theoretically possible that somebody else bids and the purchase price goes up,” Condon said.However, bankruptcy documents indicate that Gardener’s wants to expedite the sale process, which may limit other bids.“[Gardener’s Supply Co.] believe that expediting approval of the Bid Procedures is unlikely to prejudice any party in interest or impair the competitiveness of the sale process,” Gardener’s lawyers wrote.“They don’t really wanna get into a bidding war… The buyers want to be in as much control as possible,” Condon said.

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Industrial Commission is looking for ways to help farmers who lost storage and other infrastructure in last weekend’s severe storm prepare for harvest season.
“Harvest is coming, and some of these farms may only have one or two bins left,” Agricultural Commissioner Doug Goehring, who sits on the commission, said during a Thursday meeting.
A storm on Friday and Saturday generated multiple tornadoes, high winds and hail that was devastating for agriculture producers across the state. A tornado near Enderlin in eastern North Dakota claimed the lives of three residents. A fourth death in Stutsman County was linked to a power outage that resulted from the storm.
Farmers have reported lost crops and destroyed grain bins, irrigation systems and sheds. 
The impact to grain storage could amount to a loss of tens of millions of bushels, according to Goehring.
The Industrial Commission asked the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to “develop disaster program alternatives” and present them to the commission within the next two weeks, according to an email from the bank.
Governor pledges state support for storm victims while touring eastern North Dakota damage

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the commission, suggested during Thursday’s meeting that the state can provide bridge loans to farmers so they can get started replacing lost infrastructure until they get insurance claims processed.
Bank of North Dakota Chief Lending Officer Craig Hanson said during the meeting that community bankers have reported that farmers’ corn crops are mostly OK, but that they are “thinking about reseeding options” for bean crops.
“There’s some discussion on insurance versus some seed options, on how things are covered and what costs are there as well,” Hanson said.
Armstrong said the state should also think about ways it can support small businesses in communities hit by the storm.
“If a small town business closes down, the chances of it reopening are zero,” he said.
The commission indicated it would reconvene soon to take official action on the matter.

LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee), a member of the Joint Finance Committee, urged Republicans to work to ensure families have access to child care. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Joint Finance Committee is planning to return to its work on the state budget Friday. It will  be the committee’s first meeting since early last week when work halted due to a breakdown in negotiations between Republican Senate and Assembly leaders and Gov. Tony Evers.
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said then that his caucus objected to the amount of spending being considered in the budget negotiations. Two members of his caucus — Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) — have both publicly expressed their concerns about the budget being negotiated by Evers and Republican leaders, presenting a challenge in the Senate where Republicans hold an 18-15 majority. To pass a budget without winning Democratic votes, as they did last time, Senate Republicans can only lose one vote.
Assembly Republicans have been calling this week for their Senate colleagues to come back to the negotiating table and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said he was still in conversation with Evers and, according to WisPolitics, is optimistic the budget could be completed next week. Assembly and Senate Republicans met in a joint caucus Thursday.
The committee plans Friday to take up 54 sections of the budget, including ones related to the University of Wisconsin system, the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the Department of Children and Families, Department of Health Services and the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Tourism as part of its work wrapping up the budget. The budget would then need to pass the Senate and Assembly before it could go to Evers for consideration. 
Child care is a critical piece, as Evers has said he would veto the budget without investment in the state program to support child care providers known as Child Care Counts. The COVID-era program was launched using federal funds to subsidize child care facilities and help them pay staff and keep costs down for families, but the funds will run out in July and the program would end without state money. Republican lawmakers have said they oppose “writing checks out to providers.” 
Democratic lawmakers joined child care providers Thursday morning to echo calls for investing state money to continue the Child Care Counts program. 
Brooke Legler, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), said Republican lawmakers’ proposals are inadequate to meet the crisis and Republican arguments opposing subsidies don’t make sense. 
“They subsidize farmers. They subsidize the manufacturers,” Legler said. “Last [session] when they denied the funding for Child Care Counts … they gave $500 million to the Brewers, so I have an issue with them saying they can’t subsidize.”
Legler said that if lawmakers don’t make the investment in child care, they need to be voted out of the Legislature next year.
“The $480 million needs to happen, and if it doesn’t, then we need to help Sen. [Howard] Marklein and Rep. [Mark] Born find new jobs in the next election,” Legler said. “This is not OK, and we need to stop this from happening.”
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee), a member of the Joint Finance Committee, urged Republicans to work to ensure families have access to child care, saying the state’s economy relies on parents being able to work and that children are better off when they have a reliable, safe place to stay and learn.
“We cannot allow these critical centers to close their doors and opportunities to be lost to our children forever,” Johnson said. “If the families don’t have quality, dependable child care, if they have to remain at home, or even worse…  these are all options that we don’t want to face… and these are all options that our children don’t deserve.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said her caucus is prepared to work on the state budget and she has “continually” been in conversation with Evers and is open to conversations with LeMahieu. 
“As of right now, I have not heard from Sen. Devin LeMahieu yet, but my phone is on,” Hesselbein said. 
When it comes to negotiations happening behind closed doors, Hesselbein said it’s “probably normal.” 
“I’ve talked to other majority and minority leaders in the past, and this is kind of how it’s happened in the past,” Hesselbein said.
In order for Democrats to vote for the budget, she said, they would need to see significant investments in K-12, special education funding, child care and higher education.
“These are the three things we’ve talked about — improving lives, lowering costs for everyday people,” Hesselbein said. 
The UW system with the support of Evers has requested an additional $855 million in the budget. Vos said last week his caucus was instead considering $87 million cuts to the system, though Evers recently said that they were discussing a “positive number” when it comes to the UW budget. 
Democrats were critical of the K-12 budget that the committee approved earlier this month for not investing in a 60% reimbursement rate for special education and for not providing any general funding increases to schools.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), a member of the Joint Finance Committee, told reporters on Wednesday that a budget agreement between Evers and Republicans won’t necessarily guarantee Democratic votes.
“I think all of us are going to have to make our own decisions about whether or not the budget is one that we can support or that meets the needs of our districts, and that’s as it should be,” Roys said.
The committee will also take action on the nearly $50 million for literacy initiatives that has been stuck in a supplemental fund since 2023 and withheld by lawmakers because of a partial veto Evers exercised on a related law. The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday the partial veto was an overstep of Evers’ powers, striking it down and restoring the language in the law passed by the Legislature. The money is set to expire and return to the state’s general fund if not released by Monday.

The board approved the drilling of up to two test wells for roughly $25,000 apiece to determine the existing availability of water for the site, as well as the possibility of using local municipal water sources.
“We may just need water there to support the construction, at which time we do get more adequate water to maintain the site until we get water from Fort Smith or an alternative,” Board Chairman Benny Magness said.
Fort Smith officials have been considering providing water for the prison, which could require between 300,000 and 500,000 gallons per day, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Magness said he had been told that it would take too long for Fort Smith to be able to provide adequate water infrastructure, and “we’ve got to start moving forward on this site.” He floated the possibility of the city of Ozark providing water.
Officials at Vanir Construction Management, the company hired to oversee the prison’s construction, told the corrections board that the two existing wells on the proposed site were not working when contractors assessed them for depth and water flow.

Wells surrounding the site provided the desired data, but “the variability was so ranging that there wasn’t anything we could necessarily count on,” making new test wells the best option for the project, said Sean Murphy, a Vanir assistant project manager.
If one test well yields “adequate water,” drilling a second one won’t be necessary, but an inadequate water supply after drilling both wells would require finding a new site, Magness said.
The state purchased the land in November for nearly $3 million, drawing ire from Franklin County residents and officials who said they weren’t consulted beforehand. Additionally, the indigenous Chickamauga Nation has said the project could have a negative impact on its burial sites in the area.
Arkansas corrections panel OKs design firms for new prison; next step legislative approval

In April, lawmakers opposed to the location helped kill a bill that would have appropriated $750 million toward the proposed prison. Vanir put the preliminary cost estimate of the project at $825 million in March.
The Legislature set aside $330 million for the project in 2023 that has not yet been appropriated. The Arkansas Department of Corrections does have the authority to spend an additional $75 million that was set aside in 2022.
In May, the Board of Corrections approved a general contractor for the facility, and earlier this month, the board greenlit a $57 million contract for the design team.
Thursday’s special meeting also included the board’s appointment of Lee Watson, with Grant Hodges as his alternate, to a new executive committee with input on the prison’s construction. The committee will also include Vanir officials and representatives of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ office, Magness said.
Expanding prison capacity has been a priority for Sanders since taking office in 2023. Proponents of the new prison have said it’s needed to alleviate overcrowding. More prison space is also likely to be needed as a result of the Protect Arkansas Act, which eliminated parole for offenders who’ve committed serious felonies.

,DC,2025-06-26 21:35:52+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin urges Democrats to refocus on middle-class issues,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/michigan-sen-elissa-slotkin-urges-democrats-refocus-middle-class-issues,,"U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin outlined a middle-class-focused economic agenda for Democrats on Thursday, urging her party to take more seriously the dissatisfaction voters feel with their personal finances.The Michigan Democrat was a CIA analyst and worked on international security affairs at the Defense Department before entering politics. During a wide-ranging speech to the liberal think tank Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., she drew on that background while presenting herself as someone willing to tell hard truths to her own party and defy political expectations, even as she often endorsed traditional Democratic positions.“I believe that the single greatest security threat to the United States is not coming from abroad,” the first-term senator said.“It's the shrinking middle class here at home… This is the existential threat. As a national security professional, what do you do when there's an existential threat to your country? You get to work on a war plan, you face up to what's not working, you change course, and you ruthlessly pursue the economic security that's critical to our survival.”The speech was the first of three this year Slotkin said she would give on the major priorities she believes voters want addressed. She would lay out visions for national security and democracy later, she said.Slotkin also gave the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this year.After defeating a Republican incumbent in a House race in 2018 and winning statewide last year in a state Trump carried in the same election, Slotkin positioned herself as someone who can speak to the disaffected voters who sent Trump to the White House and as a possible leader in the party’s response to the MAGA movement.“It's not just Trump voters who are frustrated with the government,” she said. “It's Americans across the board.”She called for action on a range of domestic policies to reverse a shrinking middle class and urged Democrats to modify their messaging on key issues.'That anger, that suspicion'Democrats should prioritize the economic issues that they “have, quite frankly, lost touch with,” she said.After decades of post-war growth, American middle-class life is now further out of reach than ever for many, she said. That has inspired anger, she said, implying that was a factor in Trump’s rise.“That anger, that suspicion among Americans, that right there is what I mean by an existential threat,” she said. “Because in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracy like ours, when people don't feel like they can get ahead, when the system is rigged against them, they start blaming people who don't look like them, or who sound different, or who pray different. It's how we begin to tear each other apart from the inside.”That veiled criticism of Trump and some of his supporters — that many Democrats explicitly make a centerpiece of their public personas — is insufficient, she said. The party must instead make a positive case for what it wants to do. And that should include a laser-like focus on growing the middle class.“In order to attack that threat, we need to get government back to the basics of what it was designed to do,” she said.Democrats should build a policy platform around the goal of expanding middle-class opportunities, targeting job creation and education while restoring trust in government by installing guardrails against corruption, she said.Jobs, education, health care and moreTo create more middle-class jobs, the government should reduce barriers to small businesses, Slotkin said. Lawmakers should simplify regulations, taxes and licensing, she said.Regulatory barriers to housing construction should also be reformed, she said, to make buying a home more affordable.Certain industries critical to national security, such as rare earth minerals, microchips or batteries, should be protected with an array of policies including “targeted tariffs,” she said.And the immigration system should be reformed to allow immigrants to fill critical roles in the job market.On education, Slotkin said phones should be banned in classrooms and social media companies should face consequences for algorithms that lead to addiction in kids and teens.The national approach to workforce training should be completely rebuilt, she said. Forty programs across 14 federal agencies exist, she said.It would be more effective to “just blow it up right now,” and consolidate those programs, she said.To restore faith in government, Congress should also ban trading of stocks and cryptocurrencies by its members, she said. And it should end campaign contributions from corporate PACs.“The middle class doesn't have a lobbyist. They don't have a super PAC. They don't have a corporate PAC,” she said. “But they should have the Democratic Party.”‘Sacred cows’Slotkin, generally viewed as more moderate than most in her party, wanted to speak at the liberal think tank “frankly, because we haven't agreed on every single issue in the past,” she said, and said Democrats should “slaughter some sacred cows” in service of a ruthless pursuit of an economic agenda to grow the middle class.She had broad critiques of Democrats’ image and effectiveness.In the military and intelligence worlds, “if you see a problem, you don't just wait and let it fester,” she said during a question-and-answer session with Neera Tanden, the president and CEO of the Center for American Progress.“It's a bias towards action, right? And I think sometimes Democrats don't have a bias towards action. We have a bias toward navel-gazing,” she said. “Democrats have lost some of their alpha energy. I keep saying this, some of that bravado, some of that football-coach energy.”She voiced support for traditional Democratic issues like increased teacher pay, union membership, renewable energy and a public option for health insurance.She listed five Democratic “sacred cows” she would kill to advance her economic agenda, but she described them in relatively vague terms, instead criticizing her party’s messaging and legislative approach.“The first sacred cow I want to slaughter: Too often Democrats fail to make the distinction between small businesses and the largest multinational corporations,” she said. “And because of that, many Americans hear us as plainly anti-business. And while we're on the subject, too often as Democrats we have the habit of vilifying success.”Democrats also should update an “elitist” approach to climate change that allows some to use the issue as “a purity test,” she said.Immigration reform does not need to be “comprehensive,” a goal she said has dissuaded her party from accepting more incremental changes, but she said the country still needs “big, bold change to fix a broken system.”The party should be less focused on college as a destination for every student and instead invest in certifications and trade schools. And Democrats should acknowledge that overregulation can stymie what should be higher goals such as increasing the housing supply, she said.",,,,2025-06-26 18:14:00.270234

An unidentified man drowned in Lake Champlain near Red Rocks Park in South Burlington Wednesday, the third reported drowning in Vermont in the span of a week.
A park visitor noticed an unresponsive man underwater near the base of the Red Rocks cliffs Wednesday night and called 911. The South Burlington dispatchers received the call at approximately 7:43 p.m., and the South Burlington Fire Department arrived around 5 minutes later, according to a South Burlington Police press release. 
Fifteen fire department first responders helped locate and retrieve the man in water 10 to 12 feet deep. No form of identification was located when the man was recovered, according to police. 
The South Burlington Police Department is seeking information regarding the man’s identity and events leading up to the drowning. There is no evidence of foul play, according to the police press release.

“The deceased is described as a white male, bald with hazel eyes and a husky build, wearing a grey T-shirt with a white-over-black stripe pattern, navy blue athletic shorts, grey socks, and Cloudrunner grey running shoes with white soles,” the press release stated. 
The South Burlington Police Department, the Burlington Fire Department, University of Vermont Rescue, Colchester Technical Rescue and the U.S. Coast Guard aided in the search and recovery. The Saint Michael’s Fire Department and off-duty South Burlington personnel monitored the city of South Burlington during the crew’s absence. 
In the press release, South Burlington police reminded the public to practice water safety, including learning and refreshing swimming skills, learning CPR and water rescue techniques, wearing U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets and supervising inexperienced swimmers. 
A Burlington High School senior Eljak Menjwak drowned at Bartlett Falls in Bristol on Saturday, and Darren Kemp, 30, drowned in Lake Champlain on Tuesday night. 
Amid a heat wave in Vermont this week, people have likely sought relief from extreme temperatures in bodies of water. The Department of Health maintains a list of more than 400 places to cool off this summer.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is running for governor as a Democrat, is previewing her plan to bring Michigan’s education system from being one of the bottom 10 in the country to one of the top 10.
Benson laid out key goals during a roundtable Wednesday in Saginaw with educators, students, parents and school administrators.
She said her plan would include transitioning to a weighted school funding formula that is decoupled from property wealth, adding that “a child in Alpena has different funding needs than a child from Grand Rapids.”
Funding priorities would include infrastructure in school buildings and investing in dual enrollment and Career and Technical Education programs.
Benson said she would conduct a full audit of “outdated” school financing systems and make transparency a key focus “so that we can know where the money is going and ensure that we all, as a community, have confidence those funds are being invested strategically, wisely, with an eye towards what’s best for our schools, our educators and our kids.”
Another priority would be funding wraparound support services focused on mental health, after school programs and summer programs.
“It’s clear that families who benefit so much from the support they get from the schools in their community during the school year then lose that support during the summer, and that sets them and their kids back significantly when they start in the fall again,” Benson said.
To address that need, she said her plan would include a universal, full-day, five-day-per-week early childhood education system called MiCare that would be modeled on successful programs from other states and countries.

Benson said she also wants to expand access to ongoing training for teachers with a goal of increasing Michigan’s early literacy rates, which rank in the bottom third of the nation.
“I know it’s easy for folks to come in and have these big ideas for education, but I’m ready to get it done,” Benson said.
She added that “every day that we don’t spend trying to make Michigan one of the top 10 states for education in the country is a day where we’re falling behind.”
Concerns raised to Benson by educators and students include teachers paying out of pocket to provide supplies for students, parents not being able to be involved in their children’s education because they are working long hours or multiple jobs to make ends meet and training teachers to recognize when a student may need additional support rather than defaulting to penalizing them for outbursts or other signs of neurodivergent conditions.
Benson faces Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki in the Democratic primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Republican candidates include former Attorney General Mike Cox, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard (R-DeWitt), Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (Porter Township), former congressional candidate Anthony Hudson and William Null, who was charged and acquitted for plotting to kidnap and kill Whitmer.
Last month, independent candidate for governor Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan laid out his plan to invest $4.5 billion in Michigan’s schools.
Duggan warned that the investment would come with “punishment” for school administrators whose districts don’t show improvements.
But Benson said accountability measures should “uplift schools and put them in a position to succeed as opposed to pulling out when they don’t meet your needs.”

(Photo by Michael Swensen/Getty Images)The need for a special legislative session to address storm damage recovery in Kentucky hinges on the Trump administration’s decisions on pending disaster assistance requests, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear told reporters Thursday. 
Since February, Kentucky has faced three natural disasters, including two flooding events and a tornado outbreak. Beshear said Kentucky still has not received approval from President Donald Trump for public assistance to state and local governments for the April floods and May tornadoes. 
The president previously approved expedited disaster assistance for individuals and local governments for the February floods and individual assistance for the April floods and May tornadoes.

Beshear said the April floods could become a “$225-plus-million-dollar hit to the state and to the counties” if the federal government does not provide assistance to governments. Beshear raised concerns over the state’s ability to shelter Kentuckians following the disasters, saying without the public assistance “we may not be able to run our housing program as long as we have in the past.”
Beshear said other states that have faced natural disasters during the second Trump administration are also waiting to hear decisions about public assistance, the category of grants that go to state, local and tribal governments after disasters to help them recover cleanup costs and repair infrastructure. 
Shortly after Trump took office, he floated the idea of doing away with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and moving its responsibilities back to the states. The president said a couple of weeks ago that he wants to “wean” states off FEMA assistance after this year’s hurricane season. 
“We need the federal government to step up and to say they’re going to be there for our state, our cities and our counties in our toughest of moments, and they’re going to do what every other administration — Democrat or Republican — has done,” Beshear said. 
To Kentucky, FEMA has approved and dispersed nearly $2 million through individual and household assistance in response to tornadoes this spring, along with more than $1 million in other needs, Beshear said. As for the February floods, FEMA has dispersed more than $49.5 million in individual assistance and more than $18.1 million in other needs. For the April floods, FEMA has dispersed $24 million for individual assistance and $9 million in other needs assistance. 
The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is also still working on roads damaged from the April event. Beshear said 13 roads are still closed, mostly from mud and rock slides. Crews have assessed damage at 300 other locations, with the initial repair estimate topping $21.5 million. The governor stressed that assistance to local and state governments from the federal government could help with about 75% of that cost. 
The governor told the Lexington Herald-Leader in May that he would likely call a special session of the legislature to allocate more state funding for storm recovery. When asked about that possibility again Thursday, Beshear said his office is pulling together a final set of numbers, showing money needed both if federal funding is granted or not, and would meet with legislative leaders early next month to discuss it. A special session is still “certainly a possibility.” 
“If we’re not going to get public assistance, we’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars between the state and the city,” the governor said. “That throws all of our budgets out of whack and is just a major blow that would require some more significant action.”

Senate Republican leaders said on Wednesday during a press conference that it was still unclear if they would need to reconvene before the next regular legislative session begins in January. The next two-year state budget will also be deliberated at that time. 
Senate President Robert Stivers said that lawmakers would be ready to do a one-day session to approve funds if needed. He also said the legislators’ temporary structure, built to house meetings of the Senate and House while the Capitol is renovated, would be ready for use in July. 
According to a recent emailed FEMA update on disaster assistance, applications for support are being processed daily for all three natural disasters in Kentucky.

Philip Randolph Career and Technical High School on May 23, 2025 in Philadelphia and met with students, teachers, and legislators for public K-12 education. (Commonwealth Media Services)Following the U.S. military strike on Iran’s nuclear sites over the weekend, Gov. Josh Shapiro said he supports the action, but wants to hear from analysts about the bombing’s actual impact on the facilities.
“I want to see what the actual experts, military experts, and others, say about the mission that was carried out by these incredibly brave and courageous service members flying those B-2’s over Iran and, of course, those who planned this,” Shapiro said during an interview Thursday on the Mike Missanelli Show on 97.5 The Fanatic WPEN-FM in Philadelphia. 
“I don’t want to hear the BS that comes from Hegseth and some of these other folks,” Shapiro added, referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. “I want to see what actually happened there.”
Earlier this week, an initial intelligence report was leaked to some news organizations that indicated the strikes against Iran only set their nuclear program back by months and described the damage as limited, according to CBS News.
Hegseth and General Dan Cain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a press conference on Thursday to tout the effectiveness of the strikes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro described Iran as the “world’s largest state sponsor of terror” and as a “destabilizing force.”
“The last thing in the world we want is for Iran to get a nuclear weapon,” Shapiro said.
“If this mission was successful at knocking out their nuclear arsenal or their ability to develop a nuclear arsenal, that is really an important thing. That’s a good thing for the world, if we do not have a nuclear Iran. But I want to see what really happened,” Shapiro said.
He also called on President Donald Trump and what the governor referred to as “the experts” in the Trump administration to be honest and forthright about the military operation over the weekend, so “further judgment” can be made about the decision to bomb the nuclear sites.
Shapiro also praised the current ceasefire between Israel and Iran, noting everyone involved deserves credit.
“We do not want instability. We do not want war in the Middle East. We do not want innocent lives being lost,” Shapiro said. “We do not want Israeli citizens having to run in bomb shelters all the time when the Iranians target Israel.”
On Tuesday, Shapiro told reporters that the state was not facing any immediate threats following the attack on Iran, but the state would continue to work with federal partners to monitor the situation.
Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senators have both called the mission a success.
“Operation Midnight Hammer worked,” U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) posted on social media Thursday morning. “I’ve been calling for and fully supported those strikes, and it made the world safer. It should transcend partisan politics.”
U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said Iran having a nuclear weapon would be “very much against America’s interest” and called the military action “surgical, very targeted, perfectly executed mission,” during a telephone town hall on Wednesday evening.
“I think the way the President handled that in terms of giving Iran every opportunity for a peaceful resolution, and then supporting Israel, after Israel had taken out a lot of missile launchers with a targeted attack on the nuclear facilities, and saying, and this is not about regime change in an extended war,” he said. “I thought (it was) absolutely the right way to do that. I think that’s going to be a big move that introduces great stability in the Middle East.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/27810_gov_education_JF_028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 18:14:00.270234

(Photo by Julia Goldberg / Source NM)A panel of state lawmakers on Thursday questioned a Santa Fe official overseeing the city’s response to homelessness soon after its controversial cancellation of a long-standing overnight shelter’s contract.
Henri Hammond-Paul, City of Santa Fe director of Community Health and Safety, told lawmakers on the Legislature’s interim Health and Human Services Committee that the city intends to close Pete’s Place, a Cerrillos Road shelter with about 75 beds, within a year. 
The closure is part of the city’s effort to move away from a congregate shelter that sleeps large numbers of people and then kicks them out in the morning, Hammond-Paul said. 
That approach does little to tackle the root causes of homelessness and also leaves unhoused people to their own devices during the day, which “creates too much opportunity for riffraff,” he said. He also referenced complaints of business owners and residents near the shelter.  
New state study suggests homelessness far undercounted in New Mexico

“We don’t want folks just kind of loitering around throughout the day. We have to have a way for people to be somewhere and to engage them productively,” he said. 
The solution, he said, is to focus more on “micro-communities,” particularly tiny homes. Those allow unhoused people to have a place to store their belongings, “shut their door, be safe from kind of predatory and other influences in the community,” Hammond-Paul said. The city intends to establish between 30 and 50 tiny homes at a city-owned site in the near future, he said. 
The pivot away from congregate shelters happens as the city lacks as many as 1,300 beds for homeless residents, according to Hammond-Paul’s calculations based, in part, on a new state Health Department study suggesting a big undercount of homelessness across the state. 
The city now has 280 beds, he said. 
Lawmakers questioned Hammond-Paul about the city’s new contract with Urban Alchemy, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that provides street outreach and other services aimed at reducing homelessness. 
Earlier this month, after hours of debate, the Santa Fe City Council terminated the Interfaith Community Shelter’s lease at the city-owned building and approved a $1.5 million, one-year contract for a San Francisco-based group called Urban Academy to run it instead. The Council also approved a nearly $8 million, four-year contract for street outreach for the same group. 
Hammond-Paul touted the contracts as the city “killing two birds with one stone,” noting that Urban Alchemy is hiring 40 people locally and only hires formerly unhoused or incarcerated people. That makes it effectively a “job program,” he said.

New hires, paid $19 an hour, will be sent to two “hot spots” in the city to try to connect people with services, as well as provide first aid, de-escalation, harm reduction and other services, according to Hammond-Paul’s presentation. 
Hammond-Paul described the city’s strategy to move away from congregate shelters as an emergency response to quickly improve the lives of unhoused people and also residents and business owners. He stressed that it should not be considered a solution to the city’s long-standing challenge of chronic homelessness or lack of affordable housing. 
“It’s a set of emergency actions that we’re talking about making progress on that really affect the street conditions and the felt experience of being a resident of a city,” he said, “to make it so that  residents and businesses aren’t feeling the pain and also that individuals who are experiencing homelessness have services and access to positive pathways.”
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

State lawmakers also asked Hammond-Paul what the state could do to help. Legislators earlier this year approved more than $100 million to address the state’s housing crisis on various fronts, including funding aimed at improving housing affordability and also tackling homelessness. 
While Hammond-Paul didn’t mention new funding during his presentation, he did say the city is “constrained” in its ability to provide tiny homes and called on Santa Fe County and the state to help. He also asked lawmakers  to consider incentives to bring counties to the table to discuss anti-homelessness strategies. 
Santa Fe’s homelessness emergency reflects others across the state, particularly in larger cities. Homelessness has continued to increase in recent years, in both Albuquerque and the rest of New Mexico, according to recent point-in-time counts conducted by the New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness.

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

During a Thursday news conference at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced, alongside State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues and university leaders from Texas and South Carolina, that the states are developing a Commission for Public Higher Education.
DeSantis has focused heavily on “woke” ideologies by pushing legislation to ban state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and remaking state higher education institutions to be more conservative. 
In the way of his higher education initiatives, he has said, are accrediting agencies that may require a commitment to those values or other expectations for a university to be recognized. 
In order to “shape institutions in a positive way,” DeSantis said, “You gotta go two or three levels down sometimes. And we’ve identified this accreditation cartel as an issue for a long time.”
Florida is establishing the commission with the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, which DeSantis said will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
The layers, for example, can be shown by a 2023 law, SB 266, which outlawed state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but allowed for DEI initiatives to continue if required to maintain accreditation. 
DeSantis, who used to own an LSAT prep company, said during the “woke era” “institutions really became corrupted by ideology, and they were putting ideology ahead of the pursuit of truth during COVID.”

Timeline
DeSantis did not lay out a timeline for when the commission would be up and running, acknowledging that it has to meet federal requirements before the U.S. Department of Education can approve it. 
“We’re establishing it. You kind of got to go and actually do it for, you know, some period of time,” DeSantis said, adding, “I think U.S. DOE wants to be quick on this.”
DeSantis said he nudged Rodrigues shortly after Trump won the presidency. 
“We didn’t really have the prospects of launching anything like this successfully during the Biden years, but it’s a new day, and I think this is going to make a big big difference,” DeSantis said, adding that if it gets established during the Trump presidency, “then it’s almost impossible for a future federal administration to try to upend the apple cart.”
As recently as 2020, the year after DeSantis took office, the State University System of Florida created a workgroup that, in its final report, concluded that the universities’ “Board of Governors is making a clear and steadfast commitment to prioritize and support diversity, racial and gender equity, and inclusion.”
In 2022, Florida lawmakers approved and DeSantis signed SB 7044 to provoke institutions to seek accreditation from accreditors approved by the State Board of Education or Board of Governors.
Expecting favorability
“I think almost all the states in our region are going to be favorable to this,” DeSantis said. 
“All those states have done good stuff in higher ed anyways but, you know, it’s been more difficult when you have this accreditation cartel nipping at you all the time,” he said. “You know, now I think it’s going to be really, really smooth sailing.”
Florida’s and other southern state institutions are members of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. DeSantis and Rodrigues made jabs at SACSCOC, saying Florida institutions have problems with the accrediting organization and that its member schools’ performance has not been impressive. 
“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens. These reforms will benefit our faculty, our students, and the hardworking taxpayers who fund our public systems,” Rodrigues said.
In an emailed statement to the Phoenix, SACSCOC said, “We welcome any new accreditor as they go through a rigorous approval process. Accreditation is central to quality education; thus accreditors are held to high standards and must themselves be reviewed.”
“As for SACSCOC, we know we currently accredit institutions that serve the largest number of students in the country (approximately 5M),” the organization said. “As such, we will work with our partnering institutions to ensure and strengthen a high standard of accreditation that reflects the needs of students, our institutions, and the workforce.”
DeSantis complained that Florida law schools “should not be captive to having to bend the knee to get accreditation from” the American Bar Association, which he said “mandates explicit DEI compliance as a condition of accreditation” and “has now become a far left activist group.” The association has suspended its DEI standard until at least 2026.
The commission “will create a first-of-its-kind accreditation model for public higher education institutions that will offer high-quality, efficient services prioritizing academic excellence, student outcomes, and achievement,” according to the State University System. 
“​​Together, we are leaving behind the legacy systems and failed institutions of the past, while charting a new course in higher education, that puts student success at the forefront of everything that we do,” said Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner, who was recently named to that position following outcry from students who feared he would politicize the position. 



The commission’s announced core principles:

It is appropriate and necessary to introduce competition, aligned with state and institutional needs, into the existing marketplace of university accreditation.
It is in the best interests of all interested parties, including students, to launch an accrediting body comprised of true peer institutions focused on public colleges and universities and their governing university systems.
It is imperative to reduce bureaucracy through a more efficient and focused accreditation process, which will result in lower costs and significant time savings for member institutions, and which will translate into lower tuition prices for students and families.
It is critical to ensure that this new accrediting body is accountable to the states of the member institutions.
It is necessary for the new accrediting body to become and remain recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for the purposes of Title IV participation by its accredited institutions.

I certainly have and I try to have good answers for my grandchildren when they have been bullied. It happens to all of us and we are taught to turn the other cheek, try to make a friend of the bully, figure out why they are so angry and as a last resort, fight back.
I feel like my home, Nashville, is being picked on. I get that people outside of Nashville may not like us, however it appears a lot of folks want to visit us. The Nashville economy creates revenue that benefits the great state of Tennessee as well as Metro Nashville. 
In May, Nashville had a visit from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The fallout was fear, anger and for some, satisfaction. ICE arrived and stopped people going to and from jobs in our community and families were immediately separated. Many who were taken are scared of living in the country they came from and so many are looking for safety and economic opportunities — as a result of ICE, many Nashville businesses are now short staffed and closing early. 
House Speaker demands Nashville mayor ax order to report federal immigration interactions

In a perfect world, everyone would follow the law and enter the U.S. legally. I do not have the answer of making things fair and just but what happened in Nashville is upsetting, especially since our ancestors arrived here the same way. 
 The government — federal and state — are going after our mayor. He’s not perfect — no one is — but I defer to the legal community to explain exactly what happened.  Now our elected federal and state officials are investigating O’Connell and this Angry Grandmother thinks the conflict is all about who in the U.S. gets “due process.” 
What is “due process,” and why is my mayor requesting it for immigrants being detained by ICE agents?  It is the basic guarantee that every person is entitled to a notice and hearing about the evidence when the government claims they have done something wrong. When Congress debated the 14th Amendment after the Civil War, they did not want there to be any confusion about who the amendment protected.  Instead of applying it to “citizens’ Congress applied it to “persons” to make it universal, according to my husband, Larry Woods, who teaches Constitutional Law. 
In my opinion, that means when someone is arrested or cited for breaking the law, they have a right to go to court. I have been pulled over by law enforcement for speeding and had the right to go to traffic court, which I did. I pleaded guilty for going over the speed limit and was assigned to take a refresher case or attend “traffic school.” What would have happened if I had not had the chance to go to court? No due process for me. 
Instead of helping rural hospitals stay open, feeding the hungry, bringing jobs to the state or fixing roads, some of our leaders are holding media events to announce they are launching investigations of O’Connell. We could save a lot of time if our leaders would work together to solve the regional transportation problem. 
Appeals Court upholds state law halving Metro Nashville Council

I disclose that I have known O’Connell for more than 25 years. He visited the bookstore Larry and I owned, BookManBookWoman, frequently, because he is an avid reader. He was a great interviewer when he hosted a local radio show and he was one of the first people I knew in this century who took the bus or biked to work because of the cost of a car. When he was elected to the Metro Nashville Council he represented a large portion of our downtown and neighborhoods nearby. I served with him on a Metro government commission and he was calm and always prepared. Y’all, he makes his children’s lunch for school and volunteers as a disc jockey in Music City. 
Several qualified candidates ran for mayor when O’Connell was elected almost two years ago — but he was easily elected for a reason. When he was a council member he voted ‘no’ on the city financing a new football stadium for the National Football League and he said he wanted people who love our city to stay. Turned out that the majority of Nashville agreed with O’Connell because he easily made the runoff and won the general election. 
I roll my eyes and grit my teeth when Nashville is attacked again. State Republican lawmakers want to reduce the size of Metro council, even though we voted to keep it the size that it is. 
Just stop showing off and if you want to be in office then do the work and stop throwing hatefulness at us.  In the words of that great philosopher Charlie Brown I say: “good grief.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Freddie-OConnell-2-1024x676.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

Situated in the Mancos Shale formation in the San Juan Basin, Chaco Canyon holds paramount spiritual and cultural significance to several New Mexico Pueblos, the Hopi Indians of Arizona and the Navajo Nation.
Federal efforts to revoke buffer zone around Chaco Canyon prompt delegation letter

Since the Trump Administration took office, the federal government has moved to reverse a Biden administration policy — Public Land Order No. 7923 — that banned further oil and gas development on federal lands within 10 miles of the historic site for 20 years. This includes a Republican-backed bill in Congress to terminate the order.
On June 17, The National Congress of American Indians, a congress of American Indians and Alaska Natives, adopted a resolution calling on Congress to ratify federal legislation from the  New Mexico’ delegation to make the withdrawal permanent. The resolution further called on the U.S. Interior Department to complete a study looking at the area’s resources and consult with tribal governments before any final decision is made.
The buffer zone policy was hard-won, said Pueblo of Acoma Governor Charles Riley, who carried the resolution in the National Congress of American Indians.
“Over a thousand years ago, our Pueblo ancestors called Chaco Canyon and the Greater Chaco Region home, creating one of the most magnificent civilizations in North America,” Riley said in a written statement this week. “Today, we stand at a crossroads where we must choose between short-term energy profits and the permanent preservation of our most sacred ancestral homeland. The choice is clear – we cannot allow the desecration of this World Heritage Site for minimal energy gains.”
A coalition of more than two dozen conservation, Indigenous and historical preservation groups and 38 members of local and state government also this week submitted letters to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, urging him to reverse course on removing the buffer zone.
“Chaco Canyon transcends politics—it is a place of reverence that is beloved throughout our
nation,” the letter reads. “The 20-year mineral withdrawal represents years of careful tribal consultation, a triballyled ethnographic study, collaborative design, and thoughtful balancing of multiple uses. It provides essential protection for sacred sites and cultural resources while respecting Tribal sovereignty and development rights.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/50862D84-0799-8331-80F9D4BE18B29C20-1024x299.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

Jim Pillen gives his final green light. 
State law requires him to do so by Tuesday.
The emergency regulations, unveiled for the first time minutes before the 10 a.m. meeting, largely mirror a legislative proposal that lawmakers stalled on last month. The regulations would take effect for up to 90 days, pending Pillen’s approval. The two medical cannabis-related laws that voters approved mandate that applications must start being accepted no later than July 1.
  Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. June 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, an addiction prevention specialist through Heartland Family Service, affirmed that commissioners want public feedback on the emergency regulations through July 15, to inform future, formal regulations.
Public comments may be submitted to lcc.frontdesk@nebraska.gov, the repository for the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, which will forward the messages onto the state’s new Medical Cannabis Commission.
“The input that the public provides on these emergency regulations will help us immediately begin drafting the regular regulations,” Mueting said Thursday.
Emergency regulations process
Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist who chairs the commission, will send a letter to Pillen relaying the emergency regulations and stating that the “failure” to adopt them by the deadline “would force Nebraskans to seek medical cannabis or similar products from unregulated and potentially harmful sources.”
Pillen’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the emergency rules.

Licensing of new establishments must begin by Oct. 1, according to the  laws. The emergency regulations would allow licenses for, at minimum, cultivators, product manufacturers, dispensaries and transporters, and someone could be awarded only one type of license.
Justification for emergency regulations under state law can include “imminent peril” to public health, safety or welfare.
Mueting and Oldenburg will head up a subcommittee to work on the regulations in the meantime.
Commissioners also voted 4-0 to enter a legal partnership with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and Pillen’s Policy Research Office, which allows the commission to contract with DHHS for “legal services.”
Dispensary restrictions
Legislative Bill 677, which fell 10 votes short of the 33 votes needed to change a voter-approved law last month, 23-22, would have provided additional guardrails around the ballot measures that voters overwhelmingly approved in November. Up to 30 dispensaries would have been allowed under that bill, up to 10 in each congressional district.

Under the emergency regulations, no more than one dispensary would be allowed in each of the state’s 12 District Court Judicial Districts. Douglas County (Omaha) and Lancaster County (Lincoln) are the only counties that occupy a single district. Multiple medical cannabis advocates asked the commission to reconsider that specific restriction.
No dispensary could located within 1,000 feet of any school, daycare, church or hospital. At least 51% of an applicant’s business or organization would need to have resided in Nebraska and be a U.S. citizen for at least the past four years. Applicants also would need to pay to submit two legible sets of fingerprints to the FBI and the Nebraska State Patrol for a criminal background check.
Qualifying conditions and allowable products
Unlike LB 677, the emergency regulations do not specify qualifying medical conditions. LB 677 would have outlined 15 conditions eligible for the medicine. That list excluded post-traumatic stress disorder.

Nebraskans in November overwhelmingly legalized up to 5 ounces with the recommendation of a health care practitioner. 
The emergency regulations would require that a recommendation (from any provider nationwide) specify the product being recommended, the recommended dosage and potency, the number of doses, the directions for use and the name of the patient.
The regulations would allow dispensaries to sell: 

Oral tablets, capsules or tinctures.
Non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, gelatinous rectangular cuboids or lozenges in a cube or rectangular cuboid shape.
Gels, oils, creams or other topical preparations
Suppositories.
Transdermal patches.
Liquids or oils for administration using a nebulizer or inhaler.

Dispensaries could not sell raw plant or flower, food or drinks with cannabis infused into it (edibles), any products containing artificial or natural flavoring or coloring and any products administered by smoking, combustion or vaping.
LB 677 would have mandated testing of all products before they could be sold, one of the strictest testing regimes in the country. However, without a legislative change, the commission lacks the explicit authority to regulate testing under the medical cannabis laws. Instead, the emergency regulations say products “may” be submitted for testing or research for development purposes.
Packaging would need to be able to show it had been tampered with, child-resistant, resealable and protected from contamination.

Similar to 2024 restrictions on vaping products, cannabis products could not depict cartoon-like fictional characters or mimic characters primarily aimed at entertaining minors, trademarks or trade dress or products that imitate or mimic products primarily marketed to minors, symbols primarily used to market products to minors or the images and likenesses of celebrities.
Shari Lawlor of Valley told the commission that her 32-year-old daughter, Brooke, has faced severe seizures for the past 31 years but “nothing in modern medicine has helped her,” including brain surgery in 2024.
Shari Lawlor said her daughter has 11 bottles of medications and takes “handfuls” of pills.
“They’re going to kill her. If it’s not one organ, it’s another,” Lawlor said. “I would just like the option to have complete access for the patients, and that’s only by letting all different products on the market.”
Pharmacist concerns
Jim Wilson, a clinical pharmacist speaking on behalf of the Nebraska Pharmacists Association, said he has seen positives and negatives of cannabis. He asked the commission to seek input from pharmacists because of possible side effects with other drug interactions.

Wilson advocated for adding medical cannabis to the state’s prescription drug monitoring program used for other medications, which LB 677 would have done, too.
“We are not interested in the politics or any particular party or any of that,” Wilson told the commission. “We’re interested in the patient and what might happen to them.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who helped advocate for LB 677 in the most recent legislative session, said the commission has no legal authority to restrict the forms of cannabis available to patients.
“To disallow by regulation what is clearly allowed by statute is a slap in the face to the patients and families who need this medicine and the voters of Nebraska who approved it by an overwhelming majority,” he said in a text.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who introduced LB 677, had no immediate reaction.
‘A long ways to go’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the campaign that ushered the laws through the 2024 election, said the ballot measures clearly legalized medical cannabis in all forms, including flower. She said it’s also unclear where completed applications should be sent.
Speaking with reporters after the meeting, Eggers said there are good components to the regulations and that she viewed Thursday’s meeting as productive, while it had some drawbacks. She said that includes the commission voicing an intention to listen to the public and seek feedback.
“Today was a positive day, and I believe that we are moving in a forward direction,” Eggers said. “We’re not there. There’s a long ways to go. But a good foundation today.”
  Commissioner Bruce Bailey of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. June 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Bailey, who chairs the Liquor Control Commission, told Eggers that he and other commissioners had seen the regulations about 12 hours before Thursday’s meeting and hope to tie down and clear up the regulations more about the regulations over the next month.
“We’re asking for public feedback such that these things could be made whole,” Bailey said. “The best we have right now is what’s in here.”
The eventual formal regulations the commission advances this summer must include at least 30 days notice of what’s being considered before a public hearing.
The commission set its next meeting for 1 p.m. Aug. 4, with a location to be determined. If there are no meetings before then, the likely public hearing on the more lasting regulations would be in September.



The Open Meetings Act
Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Lorelle Mueting of Gretna and Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln as the at-large members of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. They join the three governor-appointed members of the Liquor Control Commission: Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, retired District Court Judge J. Michael Coffey of Omaha and Kim Lowe of Kearney.
This was the first meeting for Mueting and Coffey, whom Pillen appointed last week. Pillen did not reappoint Commissioner Harry Hoch, Jr., to Coffey’s seat, even though he applied for reappointment Feb. 2. Three other people applied for the seat.
Hoch withdrew his reappointment application May 20 at the Governor’s Office’s request for more “cannabis experience,” he told the Nebraska Examiner.
State law requires commissions to publish rules or regulations on a commission website, but the Medical Cannabis Commission does not yet have one.
It costs $70,000 to create a website through a specific state vendor, but commissioners can’t collect fees or levy any taxes on medical cannabis and thus have no funds available, unless they “borrow” funds from the Liquor Control Commission. 
The medical cannabis commissioners also don’t have separate state emails or a set state address or phone number.
Asked by commissioners how to remedy that situation, or if they would violate state law without a website, Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Swanson said: “I understand that that’s the position that you’re in. I unfortunately can’t — I don’t have any information for you on how to fix that problem.”
The commission entered closed session multiple times Thursday, often to discuss regulations and/or pending and potential litigation against the commission. 
Commissioners did not state whether a closed session was “clearly necessary” for “the protection of the public interest” or “prevention of needless injury to an individual, if such individual has not requested a public meting” before any of the three times, as required under the Open Meetings Act.
Asked by the Nebraska Examiner whether it was for either of those overarching reasons, Bo Botelho, chief legal officer of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, who is now working with the Medical Cannabis Commission, said, “No.”

Senate President Ty Masterson said the Republican-dominated Legislative Coordinating Council, which conducts state business when the Legislature isn’t in session, would consider an extension of the one-year STAR bond deadline enacted in July 2024. Masterson didn’t indicate how lengthy the extension could be.
Masterson said Mark Donovan, president of the Chiefs, asked Kansas officials to alter the deadline “in light of substantial progress the Chiefs have made in discussions” with the Kansas Department of Commerce on an NFL development on the Kansas side of the border with Missouri.
Those discussions have included building of a stadium, headquarters, practice facility and related business developments, Donovan said.
“The letter from Mark Donovan indicates that the drive to bring this historic project to Kansas is moving down the field,” Masterson said. “Now that we are in the red zone, this extension will provide stakeholders sufficient time to ensure the ball crosses the goal line.”
Missouri or Kansas? Business leaders don’t care as long as Chiefs and Royals stay near KC

Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill last year authorizing issuance of bonds that would cover up to 70% of stadium construction, but the law set the deadline for making a deal at June 30, 2025.
Last month, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed legislation that would finance up to 50% of the cost to renovate or build new stadiums for the Royals and Chiefs. Missouri’s commitment of tax revenue would be capped at $1.5 billion.
The NFL and MLB franchises play at facilities in Kansas City, Missouri, that were built in the early 1970s. Owners of the teams have encouraged formation of public funding packages that would support replacement of those stadiums. Debate about the future of both franchises has rekindled the economic border war between Missouri and Kansas.
The Legislative Coordinating Council would take up the measure altering the deadline at 2 p.m. July 7 in Topeka.
“The complexity and scale of the project, and the importance of crafting a structure that works for all stakeholders, make it clear that more time is needed to bring the effort to full fruition,” Donovan said in a letter to Masterson.
He said the Chiefs had engaged in multiple rounds of dialogue about stadium proposals with the state Department of Commerce. The Chiefs hadn’t received a response to the franchise’s latest proposal in six weeks, he said.
“Extending the secretary’s authority will allow that process to continue productively and will preserve Kansas’ ability to secure the most significant economic development initiative in its history,” Donovan’s letter said.

(Photo by Getty Images) An Iowa lawmaker who pushed for the passage of a bill to create a state program allowing the medicinal use of psilocybin said Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to veto a bill pertaining to the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms was a “great decision.” 
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, said rather than focus on rescheduling a synthetic version of the drug, the state should instead prioritize creating a state program legalizing the psychiatric use of naturally occurring psilocybin. 
House File 383 would have allowed for the prescription and distribution of synthetic psilocybin immediately following federal approval of the drug, and mirrored a similar bill, which was signed into law, in Colorado.

The bill dealt with crystalline polymorph psilocybin, a compound commonly known as COMP360, which is a treatment developed by the biotechnology company Compass Pathways to help patients with treatment of resistant depression, post traumatic stress disorder and anorexia nervosa.

Shipley said he “condemns Compass Pathways” for its approach at creating, and patenting, a synthetic version of the “natural psilocybin that God has given us that everyone knows and loves.” 
Compass Pathways declined to comment on the veto of the bill, which it lobbied in support of, and on Shipley’s comment. 
Shipley’s emailed statement also apologized for his vote in favor of the bill, which passed unanimously in both the House and Senate. 
“The proper legal framework is to reschedule psilocybin to schedule IV or III, and allow the relevant state regulatory boards to make it available as medicine,” Shipley said. 
Reynolds, in her explanation of the veto, similarly said the state should have time to review any federal action on the synthetic version of the drug before it legalizes it at the state level. 
Shipley was a vocal supporter of House File 978, which would have legalized the use of psilocybin for psychiatric treatment through a state program. The proposed program would have operated similarly to the state’s medical cannabis program. 
The bill passed the House with an overwhelming majority in late April, but was not taken up by the Senate. 
“It’s my hope and prayer that the Governor’s office and the Iowa Senate will agree to take up … HF978 as an immediate priority next January,” Shipley said.

But most of the proposals failed to make it over the finish line during the 2025 legislative session, even though seven political operatives, campaign workers and elected officials are currently facing charges for allegedly manipulating Bridgeport’s absentee voting system.
One measure would have banned anyone who is convicted of an election-related crime from passing out candidate petitions or absentee ballot applications to voters for 12 years.
Maria Pereira, one of the defendants who is accused of mishandling absentee ballots during the 2023 election, is already passing out absentee applications for Bridgeport’s municipal primary in September.
Records reviewed by The Connecticut Mirror show Pereira, a member of the city council, obtained 300 absentee ballot applications in late May to distribute to voters ahead of that upcoming election.
Callie Gale Heilmann, one of the founders of Bridgeport Generation Now, said Pereira’s ongoing involvement in the absentee process in Bridgeport is evidence of why the legislature needs to act.
That prohibition against passing out petitions or applications, which was requested by Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas, was a direct response to the ongoing criminal cases stemming from Bridgeport’s 2019 and 2023 Democratic mayoral primaries.
But even with Thomas’s backing, neither the House or Senate took up the legislation before the session closed on June 4. The measure was initially in a Senate bill and was later repackaged into a different House bill that involved several other election reforms.
The Secretary of the State’s office called the measure a “commonsense improvement” to the state’s election laws and vowed to introduce similar bills in future legislative sessions.
“It’s not uncommon for good bills to die on the calendar — it happens every session. In years without a presidential election, election-related legislation can struggle to gain attention amid other priorities,” Roger Senserrich, a spokesperson for the Secretary of the State, said. 
But advocates in Bridgeport, who have repeatedly called for reforms to the state’s absentee ballot laws, were less accepting of the legislature’s failure to take up the measure this session. 
Heilmann and Gemeem Davis, the founders of Bridgeport Generation Now, said they felt like there was finally momentum this session to address the wave of alleged absentee ballot crimes that have taken place in the city in recent years.
But they said that optimism faded as the final days of the legislative session ticked by and most of the election reforms stalled.
“We were very disappointed this session, because despite having people arrested and trials about to begin, our state legislature chose not to move any of the bills forward,” Davis said. “That’s incredibly disappointing because Bridgeport residents and voters across the state deserve to have this issue settled and deserve a democracy that works for all of us.” 
“If we want changed behavior, we have to do things to make sure that that behavior is changed,” Davis added. “It needs to be codified in the law.” 
Lawmakers did approve funding through the state budget to authorize an election monitor in Bridgeport through the end of 2026. But Davis and Heilmann said that is unlikely to prevent the people who have been criminally charged from continuing to influence the city’s elections. 
Heilmann said she would prefer that the state ban every political operative from distributing absentee applications, but she said the 12-year ban for people who are convicted of an election crime would be a start.
“I guess we just expected that the governor, the Secretary of the State and the leaders of the legislature to all prioritize protecting the voters of Bridgeport, given that it’s the largest city in the state of Connecticut and that this scandal has made international news,” Heilmann said.
Several lawmakers, including Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, told CT Mirror that there was bipartisan support for implementing the 12-year ban on anyone who pleads guilty or is convicted of an election crime.
But that was not enough to get the bill to a vote as lawmakers raced in the last week to pass a mountain of other legislation.
Blumenthal said there was a bipartisan agreement in the House to pass the election bill “expeditiously,” but he said the House leadership wanted a similar commitment out of the Senate before they would spend the time to pass it.
Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Duff said he and his colleagues were waiting on the House to pass the final version of the bill, since it originated in that body. 
“As Senate Majority Leader, I am in charge of bills that are before the Senate,” Duff said in a written statement. “I cannot pass a bill that never passed the House and was never before the Senate.”
Sampson, who is the ranking member on GAE, said he intended to offer up more than 15 amendments to the bill, including proposals to implement ID requirements and signature verification for absentee voting. 
But he said that would not have prohibited the House and Senate leadership from passing the legislation, since he didn’t intend to filibuster a bill that he supported. With no other election-related bills coming up for a vote during the session, Sampson said it was his only opportunity to offer up various election policies favored by Republicans. 
As a member of the Republican minority, Sampson said he does not have the power to decide what bills get called up for a vote, and he said it was on the Democrats, who have a supermajority in both chambers, to explain why the election reform wasn’t prioritized. 
“That bill, had it been brought to the floor, I suspect, would have passed unanimously,” Sampson said. “It was their choice whether or not they were willing to potentially pay the price of having to debate some other election-related issues in order to get it across the finish line. But I was not going to filibuster for hours at a time, certainly on bills that I supported.”
“The fact is that when bills do not pass, that is on them,” Sampson said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1107_SR_BridgeportBallots_033-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

About 4,000 physicians signed a letter from the Committee to Protect Health Care, an advocacy group, urging the U.S. Congress to stop cuts to Medicaid included in the “big, beautiful bill,” saying slashing the initially proposed hundreds of billions of dollars would mean taking health care away from millions of Americans who need it the most. 
“Whether by simply slashing funding, or by imposing block grants, per capita caps, work requirements, or other arduous rules that make it harder for eligible patients to maintain coverage, your efforts will have the same result: fewer Americans with access to the care they need all so that billionaires and big corporations receive a tax cut,” the doctors wrote.

As the U.S. Senate reviews it, the bill will change, especially now after the Senate parliamentarian’s Thursday ruling establishing that the proposed Medicaid changes don’t comply with the rules to advance a reconciliation package. 
That means that the Finance Committee leadership must rework or completely eliminate nine changes to health care programs it included in the bill. Republicans won’t be allowed to reduce federal matches to state funding for Medicaid coverage for immigrants lacking proper documentation, among other proposals. 
US Senate GOP mega-bill suffers major blow with ruling on Medicaid cuts

It’s still uncertain how the final plans will look like after the Senate-mandated adjustments. However, on a Wednesday virtual call, physicians from North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine and Utah were bracing for the original Medicaid cuts, which they said would be devastating and affect at least 8.6 million Americans and raise health care costs for millions more.
Dr. Addison Alley, an OB-GYN in Salt Lake City, said that Medicaid is often the only way some of his patients have access to prenatal, postpartum, preventative and lifelong care.
“Thanks to Medicaid I’ve been able to catch life-threatening complications early during people’s pregnancies. My patients have been able to get mental health support while suffering from postpartum depression because of Medicaid,” Alley said. “And women (with) chronic conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes can safely carry their pregnancies to term and deliver healthy babies.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Alley can’t count the number of times Medicaid has made a difference in his practice, he said. One of his patients discovered issues with her baby early in her pregnancy and was able to receive specialized care. Another, also on Medicaid, found out during a routine visit that she had started developing high blood pressure in the third trimester.
“We were able to safely monitor both her and her baby, and deliver her before she developed complications such as a stroke or kidney injury, and were able to prevent negative impacts to her child, including loss of a pregnancy,” Alley said.
Under the initial proposal, about 80,000 Utahns were at risk of losing health care coverage with the state losing an estimated $381 million.
Analysis: Upwards of 80K Utahns could lose health insurance under ‘big, beautiful’ bill’

That scenario, Alley said, doesn’t just mean fewer doctor visits, but more medical crises because when people don’t have health care, they often skip or delay care.
“Women will skip prenatal appointments and miss warning signs. They’ll give birth without ever having seen an obstetrician. Postpartum depression will go undiagnosed, untreated. Cancer screening will not be performed,” Alley said. “And also, the children of these women will suffer as well.” 
“We’re talking about real people, coworkers, neighbors, loved ones, who will face the consequences of legislation that treats health care as optional,” he said.
Some of the most vulnerable to the cuts are in rural areas. In Utah, Alley said, 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees live in rural parts of the state where access is limited and some hospitals, which are already at risk of closing, could completely shut down. 
“That’s why I’m asking Senators Mike Lee and John Curtis on behalf of my patients and their families to protect their health care and reject this dangerous attack on Medicaid,” he said. “I’m hoping our senators will do the right thing, protect Medicaid, protect women, protect babies and protect the communities that rely on this care every day.”
The Senate Parliamentarian is still reviewing whether other health care provisions meet the reconciliation rules. That includes a proposal that would ban using Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services. 
However, other Planned Parenthood-related prohibitions were also unveiled Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a case out of South Carolina that Medicaid recipients won’t have a right to sue to visit the doctor of their choice. That means states may remove clinics from their lists of approved Medicaid providers, including abortion clinics.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 20:39:43+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven pilot seeks to test CT baby bonds program — and close the racial wealth gap,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/wealth-accelerator-ct-baby-bonds-new-haven/,"Through a new pilot program, advocates hope to take another nation-leading step in CT's effort to create wealth in marginalized communities.","In 2023, Connecticut became a national leader when it launched its “baby bonds” program, an experiment that seeks to help vulnerable communities and close the state’s racial wealth gap.
Two years later, advocates in New Haven hope to take another nation-leading step in the state’s effort to create wealth in marginalized communities, by launching a pilot program that will test what happens when the first baby bond recipients turn 18.
Supporters gathered at the Connecticut Center for Arts and Technology on Wednesday for the launch of the Wealth Accelerator, a program that aims to test new approaches to wealth building and economic justice. The ultimate goal of the initiative, supporters say, is to promote economic equity in Connecticut.  
“We want to see intergenerational wealth transfers come from this work,” said Yaw Owusu-Boahen, the Accelerator’s inaugural director. 
The accelerator employs strategies similar to the tech industry, focusing on a model that Owusu-Boahen described as “ideation, incubation and scale,” and will formally start its first program, called “Cash Catalyst,” in August. 
The Cash Catalyst program will serve as the nation’s first “accelerated baby bonds” program, giving financial education and over $500,000 in direct cash to participants between the ages of 18 and 30. Those are the same ages that Connecticut baby bonds participants will be when they are allowed to access their money. 
The effort will stick closely to the conditions laid out in the state’s baby bonds program in the hopes of providing insights into future distributions. By tracking the outcomes and headwinds participants face, the program should offer valuable data as other states — and the federal government — consider similar investment programs. 
The Cash Catalyst program could also have immediate economic impacts in New Haven. Advocates anticipate the money, given directly to participants, will help more people in the region start down the path toward economic stability.
“We’re going to prove that building wealth in Black and brown communities, in low income communities, in historically excluded communities, is not only possible, it’s necessary,” said Karen DuBois-Walton, the president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Greater New Haven, and a member of the Wealth Accelerator’s steering committee. 
A $564,000 test
The Cash Catalyst program will provide a close simulation of the state’s baby bonds initiative, which was first launched on July 1, 2023. Babies born to households enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, HUSKY, on or after that date receive $3,200 in an investment account.
Over time, that money will grow, and when recipients are between ages 18 and 30, they’ll be able to withdraw from their accounts. The money may then be put toward a variety of approved expenses, including starting a business, making a down payment on a home, paying for college, or making other financial investments.  
To model what this distribution — which will begin when the first baby bonds recipients turn 18 in 2041 — will look like, the cash catalyst program will also focus on giving money to people between the ages of 18 and 30. Eighty-two participants have been selected for the program, each will receive $2,000 to pay off debts, start a savings account or make other investments. 
In addition, 20 of the participants will be randomly selected to receive a separate $20,000 “cash injection” that will be subject to the same spending requirements as the baby bonds. 
In total, the pilot program is expected to distribute $564,000 to participants. The money has been provided with the support of M&T Bank, Edward Jones and the Connecticut Project. Other local and national partners provided additional research and planning support. 
By structuring the program in this way, Owusu-Boahen explained in an interview, the program aims to show how the future baby bonds participants might spend the invested money.
The program will also include a financial education component. Prior to receiving any money, all participants will go through a series of eight financial literacy classes that will teach skills like budgeting, investing, and long-term financial planning. They will also have sustained access to MoneyByrd, a financial planning app that will help them maintain the skills taught during the program. 
“We want folks to come through the program to walk away feeling more confident about their finances,” Owusu-Boahen said. 
Each participant has been selected after completing a workforce development or educational program or other training provided by the Connecticut Center for Arts and Technology (ConnCAT). The program will release the first round of funds, the $2,000 payments, later this year. Those selected for the $20,000 payment will receive the money in two installments, the first half will be distributed in January 2026, and the second in January 2027. 
‘We are doing this work for those who have yet to be born’
At the launch event, speakers noted that the pilot program could help reverse historic inequities in New Haven and the state more broadly. 
“When communities are in the driver’s seat, when they’re truly heard, meaningful and lasting change becomes possible,” said Arden Santana, the chair of the Wealth Accelerator’s 10-member resident council, a group of community advisors who will support the program and provide insights from the area. 
The pilot program comes as baby bonds initiatives receive national attention, and as the Trump administration is pushing its own version of the concept. Known as “Trump Accounts” that proposal would give newborns a $1,000 savings account from the federal government that parents could add money to over time. There are no income restrictions on entering the program, and children born between 2025 and the end of 2028 would be eligible. 
But that proposal, which comes after years of more targeted baby bonds initiatives failing at the federal level, has faced criticism for likely helping wealthier families more than poorer ones, making it unlikely to have an effect on the wealth gap. 
In Connecticut, supporters of baby bonds stressed the importance of focusing on disadvantaged groups. 
“I know the sting of poverty, I know the psychic pain of poverty, and I know what it does to one’s confidence,” said Erik Clemons, the founding CEO of ConnCAT and the Connecticut Community Outreach and Revitalization Program. “We are doing this work for those who have yet to be born.” 
Owusu-Boahen said the Cash Catalyst program will have at least one more cohort in the future, this one pulling from neighborhoods beyond New Haven in the hopes of understanding different conditions in the state. He hopes the pilot will provide insights that will help across the country, encouraging other states and communities to develop their own baby bonds initiatives.
In the coming months, the Wealth Accelerator will look toward finding new programs it can launch, all aimed at pulling communities out of poverty. 
“As an institution, we’re saying you matter,” Owusu-Boahen said. “You’ve been historically excluded. You’ve been historically not given opportunities. This is us giving you that opportunity and validating that you can do it — you can build wealth, you can change your economic circumstances.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OwusuBoahenWealthAccelerator-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

DeSantis' office in 2019. (Photo by Mitch Petty/Florida Phoenix).Among the new laws that will go into effect in Florida on July 1 is one of the most controversial of the just completed legislative session — HB 1205, which will make it much more challenging for citizen-led constitutional amendments to get on the ballot.
That’s why there’s an effort taking place this weekend for a petition signature “surge” for the various campaigns working to get initiatives on the 2026 ballot.
Although the effort is statewide, it’s focusing on seven of the biggest counties in the state — Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Lee, Orange, Hillsborough and Duval — because they touch the 14 congressional districts being prioritized by a new campaign for a proposed amendment to overturn the new law.
There will also be an intense focus on collecting signatures this weekend in St. Petersburg, where hundreds of thousands of people are expected to participate on both Saturday and Sunday at the St. Pete Pride Festival.
Sponsors of citizen-led initiatives need to get approval from the Florida Supreme Court on the clarity of any amendment summary, gather 880,062 valid signatures from at least half of the state’s 28 congressional districts to appear on the ballot, and win at least 60% voter approval to pass. Those efforts are expected to become much more challenging once the new law takes effect next Tuesday.
Sending a message 
“We’re obviously urging them to sign the petitions, help us get to the threshold that we need for the total number of petitions across the state, but it also sends a message that in every corner of this state folks are waking up to the fact that [Gov. Ron] DeSantis is trying to crush our constitutional amendment petition rights — and we the voters, across party lines, Democratic, Republican and independent, are not going to allow him to crush those rights without a fight,” said Chris Wills, with the Florida Constitutional Amendment Network.
That particular group is working to get three separate constitutional amendments on the 2026 ballot: one that would overturn the new legislation on citizen-led constitutional amendments; another that would provide constitutional protections for any individuals or businesses that purchase an insurance policy in the state; and a third that would allow all voters to sign petitions electronically.
Among the active campaigns to qualify for the 2026 statewide ballot are proposals to:

Establish a right to clean water.
A return effort by the group Smart & Safe Florida to legalize recreational cannabis for adults 21 and older.
Expand Medicaid by the group Florida Decides Healthcare.

The latter two groups are involved in a federal lawsuit aimed at overturning the petition-gathering restrictions. They have claimed in court documents that the new law is “legislative gaslighting” not designed to block fraud in the initiative process as claimed by DeSantis and members of the Legislature, but to “effectively destroy the people’s right to invoke the citizen initiative.”
The Republican Party of Florida has since joined the lawsuit, defending the state law.
The Miami-based Wills has worked with both Republicans and Democrats for nearly three decades. He was former district secretary for Miami-Dade County Republican state Rep. Carlos Lopez-Cantera before joining with him as a staffer when he was appointed by Rick Scott to serve as lieutenant governor.
But he quit the GOP in 2016 after Donald Trump won the party’s presidential nomination and now works with Democrats. He says voters of all political affiliations should be outraged by the decision of DeSantis and the Legislature to restrict the power of the citizenry to effect change at the state level.
“As we talk to folks in a nonpartisan way, we have lots of folks that are realizing that no governor or legislator, whether they’re a Democrat, Republican, or independent, should be empowered to rip away the constitutional rights of the citizens’ initiative process,” he said. “It’s our process. It’s protected by our Constitution. It’s enshrined in our Constitution, and no politician should be able to rip it away no matter what party they are. And so we’re getting lots of support across the entire state.”
Restrictions to go into place
Starting on July 1, the state will require people collecting signatures and petitions to register with the Secretary of State. People convicted of felonies who haven’t had their voting rights restored, non-U.S. citizens, and non-Florida residents could no longer collect signatures or petitions. The law will require signed petitions to be returned to the supervisor of elections office within 10 days after the voter signs them, a much quicker turnaround than the existing 30 days allowed. Fines will accrue by $100 for each day those petitions are returned after 10 days.
Other new restrictions target people who collect, deliver, or otherwise physically possess more than 25 signed petition forms in addition to his or her own signed petition form or a signed petition form belonging to an immediate family member, and who is not registered as a petition circulator. They’d be liable to a third-degree felony.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 20:28:07+00:00,CT Mirror,Audit finds more kids missing from CT foster care,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/ct-kids-foster-care-dcf-report/,"Children went missing from DCF care about 3,700 times from fiscal years 2021 to 2023, and the number of incidents increased by 42%.","As the number of foster children who ran away and went missing increased, the state Department of Children and Families didn’t do enough to make sure it didn’t happen again or make sure the kids were safe, according to a new audit.
The Connecticut Auditors of Public Accounts on Wednesday released a report about children who went missing from foster care from fiscal years 2021 to 2023. 
Children went missing from DCF care about 3,700 times from fiscal years 2021 to 2023. Over that time period, the number of incidents increased by 42%, the audit found.
The audit also found that DCF hadn’t followed the law in some cases and had failed to implement internal controls to make sure children stayed safe.
“The findings in this audit, in my opinion, are serious, and I think they deserve serious attention, and no child in the care of our state should ever fall through the cracks,” said Children’s Committee co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.
In the audit documents, DCF said that it had implemented several measures to treat the needs of the kids who go missing and to reduce the number who run away from care. Many of the children have trauma and complicated needs, and one of the responses may be to run away.
The report says that running away can expose children to other adverse consequences like human trafficking, involvement with the criminal justice system, substance use and falling behind in school.
The kids who go missing from care tend to do so multiple times. Less than 5% of the total number of foster children go missing, and one child went missing 100 times. Most of the kids who went missing were teenagers, and they were more often girls.
On average, they were missing for eight days, although the longest period was more than two years. Two of the children were still missing when auditors received data from DCF. One was still missing as recently as April. A DCF spokesman said all the children in the report are now accounted for and safe.
Auditors found that DCF didn’t properly analyze the instances of children going missing and had squandered an opportunity to ensure it didn’t happen again.
“Given that over 50% of the youth who are missing from care are older youth being served in congregate care settings, many with high acuity and complex needs, the Department has implemented several enhancements to its continuum of care for this population,” the agency’s response said.
DCF has since added new guidance and protocols to keep kids safe and is doing further research on the topic.
“It’s also important to understand that some youth are coming into care in their late teen years without any prior/current DCF involvement following an arrest when placement by the court in a juvenile residential center (detention) or return home is not an option,” the agency’s response said. “However, unlike detention, DCF does not (and should not) operate or contract for locked placement settings for children.”
Paris agreed that DCF is making progress.
“I truly think that this isn’t necessarily a story of inaction, that this is a story of a system under strain and trying to evolve, and trying to evolve in the 21st century, and making some meaningful strides in doing so,” Paris said.
The report also examined the cases of six teenage girls and said DCF hadn’t met their needs. Social workers and service providers said they needed more care to stay safe and that the appropriate level of care wasn’t available.
The six girls went missing a total of 341 times over three years.
Most of the children who ran away were also in congregate care settings, according to the report.
In 2023, allegations of abuse and neglect emerged from a congregate care home in Harwinton that served teenage girls. After the reports, DCF announced reforms to the Short Term Assessment and Respite Homes to ensure kids were getting more trauma-informed treatment.
Service providers said what happened at the Harwinton house was, in part, the result of a strained mental health care system for children. Increased need left the state without enough placements for kids with complicated therapeutic needs.
The audit also found that in 94% of the cases auditors examined closely, DCF didn’t document whether they screened children for sex trafficking after they’d been returned to care. This violates federal laws around foster care programs for states.
In the audit documents, DCF disagreed with the finding, saying they had developed protocols for screening.
Auditors said that DCF should establish clear protocols for reviewing cases of missing children to ensure they get the treatment they need after the incident and prevent these types of incidents from occurring. The report included more than a dozen recommendations.
Paris said there needs to be more placement options for kids who have been through trauma, especially in smaller settings like therapeutic foster care.
“We talk a big game in our state about kids being our priority and kids being the future,” Paris said. “If we want to combat poverty, if we want to combat challenges and generational traumas, the only way that we can do that for this key demographic of marginalized folks, is by actually giving more resources to agencies like DCF.”
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, said she needs to check in with DCF to learn more about their current practices, pointing out that the data is about two years old.
“I know from my work with them that they are addressing what were failures, and they’re working to be more proactive,” Maher said.
Children’s Committee ranking member Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, issued a statement Wednesday calling for DCF officials’ “immediate attention” to the issue.
“The audit points the way toward corrective measures which can prevent future tragedies involving vulnerable Connecticut children,” the statement said.
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said in a written statement that although some of the findings were already known, they are troubling.
“Children in these situations are among the most vulnerable in our state and deserve nothing less than a system that intervenes swiftly and effectively,” Dauphinais said. “The commissioner must take these findings seriously and act on the recommendations without delay. We cannot allow this to become another case where auditors return years later with the same findings.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0216_SR_DCFCommissioner_058-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Politicians and several nonprofits that advocate for those affected by poverty Thursday urged Alabama’s congressional delegation to vote against the budget reconciliation bill under consideration in the U.S. Senate.
Speaking at a press conference at the Alabama Statehouse, representatives from Alabama Arise and the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign said proposed reductions to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would make it more difficult for state residents to have access to food and health care.
“This budget is not just a spreadsheet of numbers, it is a moral document,” said Rev. Valtoria Jackson, Montgomery lead organizer for the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign. “And in its current form it will deepen poverty, strip vital support from our most vulnerable neighbors and cost lives right here in Alabama.”

The House of Representatives passed the measure by the narrowest of margins in May. The Senate has taken it under consideration. President Donald Trump has said he wants it passed before the July 4 holiday.
The proposed legislation requires that individual states bear more of the cost for funding both SNAP and Medicaid. The legislation increases the administrative costs of SNAP borne by the states from 50% to 75%. It also shifts a greater percentage of the cost for providing the benefit itself, based on a state’s error rate.
Alabama’s error rate of 7% is one of the lowest in the nation, according to Michael Ledger, president and CEO of Feeding the Gulf Coast, but would still not be exempt from the penalty because the cutoff is a 6% error rate.
“Based on Alabama’s most recent error rate, we would have to cover around $86 million in food assistance each year,” said Carol Gundlach, a policy analyst with Alabama Arise, in a fact sheet presented to the media after the meeting. “The total of the two cost shifts is $121 million per year which would, presumably, come from the Alabama General Fund.”
Speakers said the legislation would reduce the state’s economy by $1.14 billion and potentially cost almost 200,000 people their medical coverage. Speakers also said it could cost 800,000 Alabama residents access to food subsidies.
Opponents of the bill gained a slight victory on Thursday after the Senate parliamentarian stated that some of the measures that targeted Medicaid violated rules for moving forward with the reconciliation process. But even before that, however, GOP senators were having trouble coming to an agreement on the comprehensive budget bill.
The legislation would also expand an 80-hour per month work requirement to more classes of people, placing an additional burden to submit paperwork to prove they met that eligibility criteria.
“By increasing these work requirements, there is more administration, which increases the odds of error rates, which then, insidiously, makes the penalty that we pay go up while eliminating the benefits for people who are working,” Ledger said.
As for Medicaid,the bill does not renew financial subsidies made available by the Biden administration set to expire at the end of the year for those who purchase Affordable Care Act plans through the health care market exchange.
That would increase the price of health insurance and increase the coverage gap for people who generate incomes that make them ineligible for Medicaid and other social service programs.
“There is the provider tax freeze that we are unsure if that is going to remain that will impact Alabama for up to $400 million per year,” said Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise.
The legislation prohibits the state from levying new provider taxes. Currently, the state imposes provider taxes on hospitals and nursing facilities that generate revenues that Alabama uses to fund a part of the state’s share of Medicaid, while the rest is supplemented by the federal government.
Advocates were already concerned with the state’s health care infrastructure amid rural hospital closings. The bill, which reduces people’s access to health insurance, could exacerbate the problem as more physicians and medical providers hemorrhage patients.
“The late Congressman Elijah Cummings had a wonderful saying, ‘Our children are the living message we send to a future that we will not see,’” said Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery at the news conference. “If we are continuing at this pace, even our babies will not get a chance to see that. And they will not certainly be able to partake in our society in a way that their parents and grandparents were able to inherit and do better.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250626_110028-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
How 2 words could decide whether SC can remove Planned Parenthood from list of Medicaid providers

The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.

Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.

If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”
What does this mean for Indiana?
Planned Parenthood’s chapter in Indiana painted the ruling as “paving the way for other hostile states to attack” the organization, which provides health care to thousands of Hoosiers, according to a news release. 
“Abortion is already illegal in Indiana, making today’s ruling a vehicle that paves the way for hostile elected leaders to discriminate against Planned Parenthood and our patients based on care not even provided in this state,” said coalition CEO Rebecca Gibron. 
Hoosier lawmakers approved an abortion ban with narrow exceptions and eliminated state licensure of abortion clinics in 2022. A small number of procedures still occur in Indiana, but they must be performed by hospitals or hospital-owned outpatient centers.

Planned Parenthood indicated the ruling doesn’t directly impact its participation in Medicaid outside South Carolina unless other states like Indiana take action — which the news release said was “fully expect(ed).” 
Anti-abortion advocates with Indiana Right to Life celebrated the move, pointing to a 2011 Indiana law that sought to do the same as South Carolina but was blocked by courts. 
“Today’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling has been a long time coming. Indiana’s right to stop using Medicaid dollars to fund Planned Parenthood, and its business of abortion, is finally validated,” CEO Mike Fichter said. 
“Today is a new day,” he added. “With this SCOTUS ruling handing Indiana this victory, we are asking Attorney General Todd Rokita to immediately move to have the 2012 injunction vacated and for the State of Indiana to terminate all Medicaid contracts with Planned Parenthood.”

(Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)This story originally appeared on Stateline.
Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
In Alabama, the under-18 population remained flat from 2020 to 2024, at about 1.13 million people, according to the bureau. The over-65 population grew from about 861,000 in 2020 to nearly 956,000 in 2024 (11%).
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

(Photo illustration by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Corrections has lost access to more than $25,000 in federal funding meant to aid in the investigation and prevention of sexual assaults in prisons and jails.
The state Bureau of Finance and Management publishes a rundown, updated weekly, of dollars lost to the state through Trump administration cuts. The latest list includes a loss of $25,332 in “strategic support” money for compliance with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act.
The act requires prisons and jails to document sexual assaults behind bars, protect victims who report incidents and ensure adequate safeguards are in place to prevent assaults.
The lost money would have been a second-year award in a two-year grant. The state already received $28,419.
The finance bureau’s newest spreadsheet lists $23.7 million in total federal funding lost across various state agencies and projects since the start of the Trump administration.
DOC: State facilities in compliance
The DOC says it doesn’t actually need the lost federal dollars to comply with the federal law on sexual assaults in prisons. As of this week, the agency hadn’t spent all the money from the first grant award.  
Corrections spokesman Michael Winder told South Dakota Searchlight that the agency spent about $16,000 from the first year’s funding for “educational literature and training.” 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


That material included wall posters instructing prisoners on how to report sexual assaults, which listed addresses for anonymous reporting and the number to dial from inmate tablets to report an assault. The department also printed “no means no” posters, six-step staff procedure cards outlining what to do when an inmate reports a sexual assault, and pamphlets on the rape elimination act for inmates and their friends and family members.
The grant was awarded to help the department comply with the law, and Winder said it now does. He said South Dakota’s facilities are “continuously audited” for compliance with the federal statute. The remaining $12,000 from 2023, he said, will be used “to provide continued training and advancement for staff who respond, investigate, and provide continued care for victims of sexual violence within the correctional facilities.”
The state penitentiary’s most recent federal audit was finalized in January. The report found no deficiencies. Audits of each state correctional facility since 2019, as listed on the department’s website, showed no deficiencies.
In 2023, the most recent year for which data are available, there were 22 substantiated sexual assault reports in South Dakota prisons.
That was 22 out of 148 investigations tied to the Prison Rape Elimination Act. The department declined to offer details on the substantiated incidents, citing exemptions in South Dakota open records law for law enforcement records or records that could endanger others, as well as a provision in the act that bars the release of information on individual incidents.
That most recent annual report notes that the department “began tracking and reporting investigations in a consistent and efficient manner” in 2023.
Broader impact of federal funding cuts
The loss of the remaining $25,332 for South Dakota was part of the fallout from a decision by the Trump administration to cancel a host of grants related to the Prison Rape Elimination Act  Resource Center. 
The cuts effectively shut down the resource center for a short period of time. Until the change, the nonprofit organization had dozens of employees, laboring under a collaborative agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Overdose deaths, gang violence draw charges in some — not all — recent prison incidents

Many of them worked to review the audits required of every correctional facility in the U.S. every three years, and served as a resource to connect prisons and jails nationwide with partners who could help them do things like train officers on how to handle sexual assault reports.
A California-based nonprofit called Just Detention International is among the organizations that relied on and worked with the resource center. Its mission is tied specifically to sexual assaults and harassment in correctional settings.
In South Dakota, the group worked with the Rosebud Sioux Tribe to build a compliant sexual assault prevention and reporting framework for a juvenile detention facility. It’s also listed as a resource for victims in the most recent penitentiary audit for South Dakota. 
Linda McFarlane, Just Detention’s executive director, told South Dakota Searchlight that some staff at the resource center have returned since April, when the grants for states and the resource center were rescinded. 
All the audits conducted across the U.S. since 2022 remain archived on the resource center website, but McFarlane worries the pared-down staff won’t be able to review them. She’s also troubled that the funding cuts removed the staff that trained investigators and connected local coordinators with resources.
“Part of the problem was that this message was sent, that PREA is no longer taken seriously,” McFarlane said. “I think people misunderstood the defunding of the PREA Resource Center to mean the law was no longer in effect. And that is absolutely not true.”
McFarlane was glad to hear that South Dakota intends to continue adhering to the law, but she worries that jailers who may have never taken the law seriously will feel empowered to ignore it. 
“We heard from survivors and from currently incarcerated people that this felt like a huge slap in the face, that the government was signaling that they no longer take their safety seriously,” McFarlane said. “And from within the corrections departments, the people who take it seriously were panicked.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.
Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.
If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”

Greg Gianforte announced in June 2025. (Provided by the Governor's Office)Lawmaker and military veteran Marta Bertoglio is the new director of the Montana Department of Commerce, Gov. Greg Gianforte recently announced.
“Marta has been a strong partner in the Legislature and is a driven leader, dedicated to making Montana the best place to do business,” Gianforte said in a news release. “With Marta at the helm of the Department of Commerce, I am confident in her ability to recruit businesses that create good-paying jobs, helping more Montanans achieve the American dream.”
Bertoglio, a Republican of Jefferson County, was elected to the Montana House of Representatives in 2020. She resigned the post last week.
In the most recent legislative session, Bertoglio was a majority whip who served on the Education, Local Government, and State Administration committees, according to Legislative Services Division.
A real estate broker and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Bertoglio has owned and operated her small business for nearly a decade, the Governor’s Office said in the news release posted on its website last week.
“Having grown up in a small Montana town, I know how important business is to helping build community,” said Bertoglio in a statement. “By fostering resilient communities and making sure Montana is the best place to do business, we can create a bright future for our state.”
A native of Deer Lodge, Bertoglio graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1991 and went on to serve in the Air Force with her husband before returning to Montana in 2007, the news release said.
In 2016, she started a boutique real estate firm based in Helena with satellite locations across the state, according to the Governor’s Office. In addition to her legislative service, Bertoglio previously served as a trustee on the Montana City School Board.
The news release said she and her husband, Joe, live in Clancy, and have two children.
The Montana Secretary of State’s Office said Bertoglio submitted her resignation to her legislative seat on June 16, effective immediately.
The Jefferson County Republican Central Committee will provide the Jefferson County Commissioners with a list of three prospective appointees to fill the vacancy, and Commissioners will confirm an appointment within 15 days of receiving the list, said a letter from the Secretary of State to Commissioners.
In an email to the Daily Montanan, Jefferson County Commission Chairman Dan Hagerty said he anticipates receiving recommendations for the appointment by possibly next week.
In February, Gianforte, a Republican, announced that former lawmaker Paul Green, then-director of the Department of Commerce, stepped down from his role to spend more time with family after roughly one year on the job.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A union organizing campaign has turned into a contentious conflict at a Madison-based health care nonprofit.
The organizing drive at Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin has gotten mired in a mountain of litigation before the National Labor Relations Board.
There have been disputes over who should be included in a union representation vote as well as dozens of unfair labor practice charges that the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has filed against Group Health management.
Most recently, the NLRB’s regional director has issued an order blocking the election after the union argued that the charges against the co-op would taint the outcome. Group Health is denying the charges, and co-op executives say they want a vote to take place as soon as possible.
The Group Health co-op was founded nearly 50 years ago as a health maintenance organization. Members, who include its employees, say the nonprofit’s focus on primary care and wellness has been central to its appeal. Those who support the union contend that the co-op’s response to the union drive is betraying its progressive roots.
“Everyone involved are gut-wrenched by the animosity that has developed,” said Susan McMurray, a former public employee union lobbyist and Group Health member for nearly 20 years. McMurray spoke at  a union rally outside Group Health’s clinic on Madison’s far East Side on June 20.
“There’s a multitude of reasons many of us chose a cooperative model over a for-profit shareholder model for our health care and insurance over the past almost 50 years,” said retired state employee Ruth Brill, a Group Health member, at a May 13 rally for the union.
“Some of our fellow GHC members have chosen to form a union. A union is like a cooperative in almost every way,” Brill said. “I’m calling on GHC to uphold the cooperative principles that it was founded on.”
In an interview, Marty Anderson, Group Health’s chief strategy and business development officer, rejected the accusation that the co-op has engaged in union-busting.
“GHC is not opposed to a union here at the cooperative,” Anderson said. “I think our position all along has been that we want our employees to have a voice — all of our employees, to have a voice in that choice.”
But Group Health co-op members who support the union see the management’s response — challenging the union’s proposal for who would vote as well as distributing messages to workers criticizing the union — more critically.
Paul Terranova, a community organizer, said he got involved in trying to persuade the co-op’s board to take a different approach earlier this year after a conversation with his Group Health doctor.
Terranova put together a group of members and asked for a board meeting in March.
“They gave us 20 minutes on the agenda to speak,” he told the Wisconsin Examiner. “It was just us making a presentation to them and them saying ‘thank you.’”
Terranova said his group asked the board and the management to “stop the anti-union messaging [and] anti-union activity” and to “get a second opinion” from other nonprofits that work cooperatively with union-represented employees.
“They refused to engage and they denied that there was any anti-union activity or messaging going on,” he said.
Terranova is also part of a member campaign that has endorsed, with the union, four candidates for the Group Health board in elections that concluded this week. The election results are expected to be released when the board holds its annual meeting online starting at 5:30 p.m. Thursday.
Staffing struggles
The pro-union employees and SEIU filed a petition in December 2024 for a union representing Group Health clinic doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and nursing staff in three departments: primary care, urgent care and dermatology. They also included physical therapists, occupational therapists and health educators.
According to union supporters, nearly 70% of the workers in those jobs and departments had signed cards asking for union representation.

Union supporters say that in those departments, issues including employee turnover and increased workloads prompted the campaign.
“We’re calling for equitable wages, safe provider-to-nurse ratios, meaningful ways to ease the crushing workloads we face and real strategies to improve retention,” said Dr. Ira Segal at the June 20 rally.
“There’s been a lot more turnover in our staffing, and that has increased over the years, which negatively impacts our ability to provide excellent care,” said Dr. Nisha Rajagopalan, a family physician. “The increasing turnover in our staff is unsustainable.”
Staffing crunches in health care have been widespread in the last five years, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There just aren’t enough care providers and folks that assist those care providers within the [health care] system in total,” said Anderson, the Group Health executive. “We’ve had to flex with the changing health care environment.”
Julie Vander Werff, a physician assistant and union supporter, said she understands the health care workforce challenge. Despite that, she said, she’s experienced a shift in the co-op’s culture that is contributing to the problem.
“They used to be a very respectful employer, and they’ve really gotten off track in terms of how respectful they have been,” Vander Werff said in an interview. “And they’re being really punitive, and we’re losing staff as a result with high, high turnover rates.”
Who’s in, who’s out
The bargaining unit called for in the union’s original petition did not include other Group Health departments: optometry, behavioral health, radiology and pharmacy. It also did not include physical therapist techs, lab techs and interpreters, social workers, receptionists and maintenance staff.

Addressing the June 20 rally, Vander Werff explained that “other departments who are not under primary care leadership are happy with their jobs” and not interested in unionizing. “But primary care is not.”
From the start, Group Health challenged the bargaining unit described in the petition, according to a letter that employees leading the union drive sent to the Group Health board of directors on Feb. 10.
“Federal labor law says that to form a union, workers need petition only for ‘an’ appropriate bargaining unit — not ‘the’ most appropriate bargaining unit (however that would be determined), and certainly not the unit their employers would most prefer,” the employees wrote. “Rather than accepting a unit of GHC workers’ rightful choice, however, administration and counsel have chosen to contest our bargaining unit.”
Still at an impasse after two days of hearings before an NLRB hearing officer, the union amended its election petition to focus on a single Group Health facility, the Capitol Clinic on Madison’s near West Side. The employees wrote in the Feb. 10 letter that the change was made at the NLRB official’s suggestion.
Group Health challenged that, too. After an additional hearing, the Minneapolis-based NLRB regional director rejected the union’s petition for a single-clinic vote. The decision directed an election covering all clinical departments at Group Health — the bargaining unit that the co-op management sought.
Group Health’s position is that the bargaining unit the employees sought “didn’t include classes or employees that do go between our clinics,” Anderson said. “And because we are an integrated care delivery system, we need to make sure that all the appropriate employees are in the bargaining class.”  
While some Group Health members see the response to the union drive as a turn from the co-op’s roots, Anderson defended it. 
“We were formed by a vote of our members, our board is elected by our members, and I think this goes right along with our ethos as a cooperative to allow our employees the opportunity to vote,” he said.
Pro-democracy, or diluting support?
Employees involved in the union campaign and their allies among the co-op’s members argue that the management claim is disingenuous, however.
“While the administration claims they’re fighting us in order to give everyone a voice, this is a union-busting tactic to prevent workers from winning in a fast and fair election of our choosing,” the Group Health workers wrote. “Anti-union organizations do this to flood the unit with people that they hope will vote against our union.”
According to an NLRB report on union representation elections in 2023, 89% of employers didn’t challenge the workers’ proposed bargaining unit. 
Group Health member Paul Terranova rejected the idea that expanding the vote to include people in jobs and departments who weren’t interested in the union was “just trying to be democratic.”
 “If folks in Madison decided we wanted to put something on a referendum, and the state Legislature said ‘No, everyone in the state has to vote on it,’ everyone would know right away what they were doing,” Terranova said. “People would call BS. It’s the same thing here, right?”
“The right of workers to unionize and to decide what our union looks like . . .  doesn’t belong to administration,” Sarah Spolum, a physician assistant, said at the May union rally. “It doesn’t belong to lawyers. It belongs to us, the workers.”
Anderson said Group Health stands by its position. “We have no idea how our employees are going to vote,” he said. “That’s why we want to get to a vote — because we want that certainty and we want to know what our employees are feeling.”
Unfair labor practice charges
Throughout the campaign, the union has filed charges with the NLRB accusing Group Health management of numerous unfair labor practices. The allegations include changes in pay practices due to union organizing, surveillance of employees for union activity, prohibiting employees from displaying union-related materials, firing union supporters and a variety of other actions.
Group Health has denied all the charges.
After the co-op management’s bargaining unit petition was granted, however, the union petitioned the NLRB to block an election. The agency’s regional director granted the petition, ordering the election to be suspended until all the unfair labor practice charges are resolved.
The union, wrote regional director Jennifer Hadsall, “provided sufficient offers of proof which describe evidence that, if proven, would interfere with employee free choice in the election.”
Group Health, through its lawyer, has demanded a hearing on the allegations in the blocking charge, contending that it’s a smokescreen for diminished support.

At the union’s June 20 rally, Susan McMurray read from a letter she sent to Group Health’s CEO.
“Nothing good will come of this decision,” she said of the co-op’s stance during the union campaign. “It will in my view ruin GHC’s reputation in our community, cause irreparable harm to staff, as well as jeopardize patient care.
“And it didn’t and it doesn’t have to be like this,” she added. “In the past few weeks, I have communicated to management repeatedly that we could find a way through the strife and give everyone a graceful way out, a path going forward and something positive to announce at the annual meeting.”



Bad timing? Campaign comes as federal environment turns against unions
The Group Health union campaign is taking place under conditions that are expected to be more hostile to unions in  President Donald Trump’s second term.
In NLRB filings, the co-op’s legal team has staked out an agenda to roll back past NLRB decisions that were seen as more favorable to union organizing.
Federal labor law precedents tend to shift with whichever party holds the White House, as National Labor Relations Board appointments are made by the president.
A 2011 NLRB ruling during the first term of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, held that it was mostly up to workers organizing a union to define their bargaining unit, as long as it was appropriate and reasonable.
That presumption was overturned by the NLRB when the White House was held by a Republican during Trump’s first term, then reinstated in 2022 in a subsequent case under Democratic President Joe Biden.
In a footnote, Group Health’s legal brief for its preferred bargaining unit states that the 2011 and 2022 decisions favoring how workers define a unit “were wrongly decided and, as necessary, [Group Health] will seek to overturn those decisions.”

Janet Mills shares remarks at a Harris Campaign presidential debate watch party in Portland on Sept. 10. (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills urged Maine’s congressional delegation to reject the budget reconciliation bill, citing “profoundly harmful consequences” for Mainers.
In a letter dated June 25, Mills focused specifically on the health care impacts of the bill, which aims to slash funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides benefits to 175,000 low-income Mainers. She also warned that plans to roll back clean energy tax credits would hobble the state’s progress towards adopting more sustainable energy sources.
The governor warned that, if the bill comes to pass, thousands of people might be left without health insurance, and the strain on rural hospitals will increase, echoing nonprofit organizations and health care providers that have been raising the alarm over the past few weeks.
“States like Maine do not have the financial resources to absorb cuts of this magnitude,” Mills wrote to Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden. “Slashing essential services in this manner will only do the opposite of lowering taxes and fostering economic growth.”
Impact on health care 
Mills warned that the bill would cut $5.9 billion from Maine’s Medicaid program, MaineCare, over the next decade, $4.5 billion of which would be lost federal funds.
Currently, almost 392,000 Mainers are enrolled in MaineCare, with 40% of rural Mainers in Aroostook, Washington, and Somerset counties relying on the program. The governor said these cuts would likely strip health coverage from tens of thousands and increase the burden on hospitals. 
According to a May report from The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, five of Maine’s rural hospitals are already at immediate risk of closure.
And some reproductive health providers in those counties, such as Maine Family Planning, only operate one day a week because of the increasing cost of healthcare. The bill also proposes cutting funding to family planning organizations and making them ineligible for federal reimbursements. 
Other proposed changes to health coverage in the reconciliation bill, such as the elimination of automatic re-enrollment and cost-sharing subsidies, would make marketplace insurance less accessible and drive up premiums, Mills said.
Cuts to SNAP
The bill proposes requiring states to cover up to 15% of the cost of SNAP, which the federal government has historically funded in full. Currently, Maine’s SNAP program costs $356 million, which means the state could be responsible for coming up with as much as $60 million a year by 2028, when administrative costs are also factored in, which is “a cost the state simply cannot absorb,” she said.
That means the 175,000 Mainers currently relying on SNAP risk going hungry, Mills wrote.
Rollback of clean energy tax credits
Mills said the proposed repeal of clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits would undercut the state’s progress in transitioning to cleaner and cheaper energy sources. 
“At a time when New England needs energy efficiency investments and new generation resources to meet our growing energy demand, this bill could increase costs,” Mills said. Some estimates suggest Maine households and businesses could see electricity rates rise by as much as 20% without federal support.
Maine relies on federal programs to weatherize aging homes, install heat pumps, and expand rooftop solar. All these efforts could be derailed under the bill, she warned.

“There’s different things that are being added to the airport but there’s no different footprint at all. So, it has nothing to do in terms of Everglades impact or restoration.

Florida has gotten a go-ahead on the project from the Department of Homeland Security and is shooting to have the center operational in early July. The governor used his emergency powers to take over the site, which belongs to Miami-Dade County.
The criticism has ranged from those such as Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, who called it “dangerous” and “inhumane,” to those worried about environmental damage to the “River of Grass.” The airstrip was first built in the late ’60s as part of a vast jetport project that was eventually halted due to concerns about damage to the Everglades.
The Sierra Club and Friends of the Everglades are among the organizations that have come out in opposition to the project, which will have as many as 1,000 beds where undocumented immigrants will be held as the government moves to deport them.
Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said her office has “significant concerns about the scope and scale of the state’s efforts, particularly regarding the environmental safeguards in place given the potentially devastating impact to the Everglades.”
Hundreds of people turned out Sunday afternoon for a protest at the site off U.S. 41, waving signs that said things like “NO ICE IN THE EVERGLADES.”
The state has started to build the temporary detention center. DeSantis described the project as a southern Florida outpost and said his administration is working to establish a northern outpost at Camp Blanding Joint Training Center in Clay County near Starke. The Florida National Guard trains there.
“The reality is they [the federal government] don’t have enough capacity, even close to enough capacity. This is going to be a force multiplier,” the governor said.

(Andy Bosselman for Newsline)Colorado regulators on Thursday launched an enforcement action against oil giant Chevron for an April well “blowout” that caused evacuations and closures in a community in eastern Weld County.
Officials with the Energy and Carbon Management Commission said Thursday that some residents remain displaced from their homes in tiny Galeton, an unincorporated town of 250 people located about 10 miles northeast of Greeley, nearly three months after the incident at Chevron’s Bishop well pad.
The well failure caused a high-pressure flow of oil, gas and water to spew from the site for five days before emergency crews were able to bring it under control. With millions of gallons of fluid released, it’s believed to be one of the largest oil and gas spills in state history, and the resulting plume spread dangerous levels of toxic chemicals as far as two miles away, according to data from Colorado State University researchers.

“I can say with certainty that this is significant and unprecedented during my tenure, not just in terms of volumes released … but in terms of complexity, in terms of scale of impact to environmental services, as well as residents,” said Jeff Robbins, who has served as chair of the five-member ECMC board of commissioners since 2020.
A so-called notice of alleged violation issued by ECMC staff to Chevron subsidiary Noble Energy lists six different breaches of the agency’s rules, initiating what is likely to be a lengthy regulatory enforcement action. The notice accuses Chevron of violating water quality standards, breaking employee safety rules, “fail(ing) to engineer and operate all equipment within the manufacturer’s recommended specifications,” and more.
An initial analysis completed by Chevron earlier this month identified the root cause of the incident as “improper assembly” of on-site equipment by a contractor. A total of 16 oil and gas wells were planned to be drilled on the Bishop site as part of a development plan approved by the ECMC in September 2022.
As part of the enforcement process, ECMC staff will calculate penalties against Chevron that will then be adjudicated by commissioners. Greg Duranleau, the ECMC’s deputy director of operations, said the penalties were “one piece of the financial impacts this incident may have on Chevron.”
“There may be civil settlements for damage, there’s a possibility for other agencies to enforce their regulations, and of course, there’s the cost of the response and cleanup,” Duranleau told commissioners during a special public hearing on Thursday.
Four of 14 families that were evacuated from the Galeton area after the blowout remain displaced from their homes, according to Chevron.
“We continue to actively work with the remaining residents on the next steps, including getting access to their properties to conduct assessments and cleaning,” the company’s website says.
An extensive cleanup and remediation effort is underway, a process that Chevron estimates could take up to five years. Thousands of environmental samples have been taken across a 7-square-mile “assessment area” centered on the well site, staff told commissioners.
“I am optimistic that Chevron will work with us through the enforcement process to bring a timely resolution,” ECMC Director Julie Murphy said in a statement. “And I am grateful to the many folks at Chevron who are working diligently to remediate the significant impacts of this incident.”

Emily Donlin is suing United States Drug Testing Laboratories, a private, for-profit Illinois company, in U.S, District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Donlin alleges she that in 2023, she and her husband Michael Donlin were “happily expecting” their second child and that on the evening of March 29, 2023, she delivered a son at a hospital identified in other court records as Des Moines’ Broadlawns Medical Center.

According to the lawsuit, a hospital nurse then collected part of the umbilical cord and sent it to USDTL for testing. The documentation that accompanied the cord included “errors and omissions,” the lawsuit claims, and did not provide any reason or justification for the testing.
USDTL allegedly “returned a false positive result for cocaine,” the lawsuit claims, and no additional testing was performed to confirm the results. USDTL then reported the results to the hospital, but “never contacted Emily to inform her of the positive result.”
The lawsuit claims Donlin “did not learn of the false positive until a social worker with the Department of Health and Human Services came knocking on her door” and later issued a founded report of child abuse based solely on the false positive test.
As a result, the lawsuit alleges, Donlin was incorrectly placed on the state’s Central Abuse Registry. The Donlins were then “dragged into expensive and stressful Child in Need of Assistance proceedings based on the single positive test,” the lawsuit claims.
“Following the false positive, Emily tested negative on every single drug test she completed, including at least eight urine and hair tests,” the lawsuit claims. “One of the tests, a 12-month hair test, demonstrated that there were no illegal substances within Emily’s system over a year-long period.”
When the umbilical cord was later retested by another laboratory, the results confirmed the first test had resulted in a false positive, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged negligence, defamation and false light invasion of privacy.
In its response to the allegations, USDTL admits testing the umbilical cord, but denies its results were a “false positive” for cocaine. The company admits that it did not inform Donlin of the test results, but says the results were relayed to Broadlawns Medical Center, “its customer who requested the testing.”

Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings. The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “common-sense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year. South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law earlier this year when it passed the state budget. The bathroom policy became law last year when it was inserted into part of the state budget, which must be renewed each year.
The Arizona legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin lambasted Republicans over cuts to social services in the Republican mega-bill under consideration by the U.S. Senate and for efforts to tip the scales of elections in North Carolina in an interview with NC Newsline Thursday.
In a conversation at a Raleigh cafe Thursday afternoon, Martin criticized Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) for supporting efforts to cut health care coverage for his constituents and put rural hospitals at risk of closure, and said his seat is a prime target for Democrats in the upcoming Senate races.
“It’s quite despicable what the Republicans are doing right now in Congress,” Martin said. “Why are they throwing people off health care? All to give a tax break to the wealthiest people in our communities, to the billionaires, to the large corporations.”
Per an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the House version of the bill, passed in May, would cut Medicaid funding by nearly $900 billion and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $295 billion over the next decade. Martin quoted figures showing that North Carolina stood to lose $39 billion under the bill, with around 600,000 at risk for losing their health coverage.
Thom Tillis up for reelection
Martin said while Tillis has voiced some restraint over cuts in President Donald Trump’s signature bill, which is due for a vote in the Senate in the coming days, he fully expects Tillis and other Republicans to “fall in line and throw hundreds of North Carolinians off of their health insurance.”
In a June survey by Data for Progress, a left-leaning polling firm, a group of 916 North Carolinians voiced support for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, by a margin of 74% to 17% and for Medicaid by 80% to 15%. A narrow majority, 52% of respondents, said they oppose the Republican-led mega-bill. And 54% said Tillis and Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) should vote against it.
Though Tillis has reportedly spoken out against the Medicaid cuts in private with Senate leadership, according to The Hill — referencing the same figures as Martin — he has been a public proponent of Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” calling it “the most ambitious welfare reform in a generation” in a June 11 commentary.
  Martin said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) is out of step with his constituents and “continues to make himself vulnerable” in the upcoming 2026 Senate election. (Photo: Senate.gov video stream)
“He’s definitely not in line with his constituents, and you know, if you look throughout the country and even here in North Carolina, people support keeping Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security — they don’t want to see those social safety nets destroyed,” Martin said. “And they certainly don’t like the fact that they’re being eliminated all to give tax breaks to those who already have the most in our society.”
Martin said he’s spoken to former Governor Roy Cooper, considered a top prospective challenger to Tillis in the 2026 Senate race, multiple times since becoming chair, and called North Carolina “one of our best pickup opportunities in the Senate” in 2026.
“Senator Tillis continues to support policies that are really out of the mainstream of where most North Carolinians are at,” Martin said. “He continues to make himself vulnerable in a very much swing, purple state.”
Elections in North Carolina
Martin took aim at North Carolina Republicans for their efforts to overturn the 2024 state Supreme Court race, in which Justice Allison Riggs defeated challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin by just 734 votes.
“They tried to disenfranchise 60,000 voters who cast their vote for Justice Riggs,” Martin said. “These are attempts by people to hold on to power that know they’re on the wrong side of the issues and they’re on the wrong side of demographic trends in this state.”
He also condemned efforts by the State Board of Elections, which recently came under the oversight of Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek, to potentially disqualify as many as 200,000 voters in upcoming elections along the same lines as Griffin’s lawsuit. The election board voted Tuesday to request missing information — either a driver’s license number or partial Social Security number — from voters who do not have it on file, which Griffin unsuccessfully argued disqualified their votes.

“What do they do? They make it harder for people to participate. They make it harder for people to actually have their votes counted and for them actually to be full participants in their democracy,” Martin said.
Despite this, Martin voiced optimism for upcoming races in the state. Though Democrats fell short in the presidential race in North Carolina, they won most of the statewide races on the ballot, including the governor, lieutenant governor, and Supreme Court elections — a fact that Martin touted as a sign of strength for the party going into a highly contested Senate election.
“There’s certainly a good trend line that’s developing here electorally for Democrats, but we don’t take anything for granted,” Martin said. “We know that North Carolina is a swing state and it’s going to require us to make a deep investment of time, energy, and money in this state if we’re going to beat Thom Tillis next year.”
He attributed the party’s success in those races to the changing demographics of the state, whose electorate has become younger and more diverse with each passing year. And he also pointed to Republicans in the state growing out of step with North Carolinians and embracing increasingly extreme right-wing positions.
In addition, Martin praised Governor Josh Stein for rising “above partisanship” and focusing on North Carolinians’ economic issues, running as someone who is “centered on an economic agenda that’s going to help everyone, not just a few people.”
“Whether they lived in rural North Carolina, whether they lived in big cities or the suburbs, everyone had a chance to actually improve their lives, and he presented an agenda that actually appealed not just to Democratic voters but to independent voters, and even some moderate Republicans who supported him,” Martin said.
The party’s future
In seeking a direction for the party, Martin said it’s critical to focus on an economic agenda that “speaks to working class people in this country again” — something he saw from both Stein and, in New York City’s recent mayoral primary, State Rep. Zohran Mamdani, who prevailed in an unexpected rout of former Governor Andrew Cuomo.
“He focused almost exclusively on affordability, right, and on economic issues,” Martin said. “His message was really focused on how to make it easier for people to afford to live in New York City, and he didn’t stray too far from that.”
He also credited Mamdani with listening to a wide range of voters, including seeking out Trump supporters and asking what issues were important to them in the recent presidential election and proceeding to earn their trust with an economic agenda that spoke to them.
“What I think many politicians in the Democratic Party need to learn is not just how you organize in-person, but how you organize online, using the power of social media to really engage people in the conversation and create excitement and energy around your campaign,” Martin said.
He said the party will “work our butts off to help get him elected as the next Mayor of New York City” and dismissed concerns over Mamdani’s identification as a socialist, which Republicans have used as an attack line for the Democratic Party at-large — including Trump, who posted Wednesday that Mamdani is “a 100% Communist Lunatic” and condemned Democrats for supporting him.
“The fact that Donald Trump doesn’t understand the difference between a communist and a socialist should tell you everything you need to know,” Martin said. “As long as I’m the DNC Chair, all are welcome, all are invited in this big tent party of ours. I believe you win through addition, not subtraction.”
Though he and former DNC Vice Chair David Hogg came into conflict over the latter’s pledge to back primary challenges to aging Democratic party leaders — a feud that ultimately saw Hogg ousted from his position in party leadership — Martin clarified in the interview that he views primaries as important for holding officials accountable, but believes party leaders should not “put their thumb on the scale.”
“What that does is it actually pushes people out of the conversation. And I know that from firsthand experience in 2016,” Martin said. “There are a lot of young people who supported Bernie Sanders, as an example, and those young people left the party for good. They never came back because they felt like the party bosses were trying to rig the system and, you know, play favorites.”
  Martin praised North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton as “one of the best we have in the whole country,” citing her work in rural communities as crucial for winning the state in the future. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
Martin also offered praised for North Carolina party chair Anderson Clayton, among the youngest party leaders at 27. Martin lauded “the energy that she brings to the job” and her focus on rural areas and small towns in North Carolina as helping to deliver key victories in the 2024 races. Clayton is currently in the midst of a “rural listening tour” across the state, which Martin pointed to as important work.
“She’s one of the best we have in the whole country,” Martin said. “The energy that she brings to the job is what we all should be doing, and I’m really a huge fan of hers.”
Martin said he was not yet looking ahead to 2028 in North Carolina, citing his focus on the Senate race, but said it’s critical for Democrats to “build a foundation here to be successful in the future.”
“North Carolina is going to decide, not just in ’28, but in ’32 and beyond, who the next President is, who controls Congress, who controls a number of different levels of power, including here in North Carolina,” Martin said. “We’re going to be investing heavily in terms of time, energy, and money in ’26, ’28, and beyond.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6262260-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 16:08:29.985150

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Increases to tuition and fees requested by 15 public colleges and universities were all approved Thursday by a board governing Oklahoma higher education. 
Tuition and mandatory fees for resident undergraduate students will increase at an average of 1.9% statewide, or just over $121 annually, after the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education approved requests impacting over half of the institutions they govern. University and college presidents presented their requests to the state regents Wednesday. 
While 10 colleges and universities did not request increases, many of the presidents that did cited inflation or rising insurance costs as the reason for needing more revenue. 
Regent Dustin Hilliary said while Oklahoma is not a “big, rich state” that can appropriate billions of dollars to colleges and universities like other states, the state regents worked at the state Capitol to secure funding. 
“We did have a good effort in the halls of Capitol to hopefully get some legislative funding so that we didn’t have to have these tuition increases where our students are bearing the cost,” he said. “… And I think that we’ll probably be chasing those same dollars next year.”
The state Legislature appropriated $1.1 billion to the state regents for next fiscal year, which is about $80 million more than the current budget year. 
Despite the increases, all Oklahoma public colleges and universities remain below the threshold set by the Legislature to keep higher education in the state affordable and below the average cost of peer institutions. Attending Oklahoma colleges and universities is averaged to be 74% of the cost of peer institutions, according to a news release. 
The regents approved requests from: 

University of Oklahoma for a 3% increase, or $9.80 per credit hour, 
University of Central Oklahoma for a 2.6%, or $7.53 per credit hour, 
East Central University for a 3.8% increase, or $10 per credit hour, 
Northeastern State University for a 3% increase, or $7.70 per credit hour, 
Northwestern Oklahoma State University for a 3.5% increase, or $8.75 per credit hour, 
Southeastern Oklahoma State University for a 3.6% increase, or $9 per credit hour, 
Southwestern Oklahoma State University for a 2.7% increase, or $7.13 per credit hour, 
Langston University for a 3% increase, or $6.93 per credit hour, 
Connors State College for a 0.6% increase, or $1 per credit hour, 
Murray State College for a 2.3% increase, or $4.20 per credit hour, 
Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College for a 2.9% increase, or $5 per credit hour,
Oklahoma City Community College for an 8% increase, or $10.77 per credit hour, 
Rose State College for a 2.3% increase, or $3.78 per credit hour, 
Seminole State College for a 3.1% increase, or $5 per credit hour, and
Western Oklahoma State College for a 3.2% increase, or $5 per credit hour. 

Increases at public regional universities averaged 2% annually and 1.8% for public community colleges. OU was the only research university that had an increase as Oklahoma State University did not request any changes to tuition and fees. 
State law also requires the regents to increase financial aid in tandem with increases in tuition, which will be a 5.3% increase, according to a news release. 
Regent Dennis Casey, board chair, said he appreciated the work that had gone into the requests and that it had been years since some of the colleges and universities requested increases. 
“I don’t worry about a whole lot of other decisions that I have to make here,” he said. “But this one is a big one, and I know it is for these members too. We don’t take it lightly.”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

“He was loved by everyone in our caucus, and he will be deeply missed by all of us,” Whitver said. “He was part of our Senate Republican family, and we mourn with his family just as we would mourn any member of our own.”
The 66-year-old Republican represented Senate District 1, covering a section of Woodbury County including Sioux City and Lawton. He was first elected to the Iowa Senate in 2022, unseating incumbent Sen. Jackie Smith, D-Sioux City. Before his time in the Legislature, De Witt served on the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. He also had worked as courthouse security for the Woodbury County Sheriff’s Office and at MidAmerican Energy for 22 years.
Other Iowa leaders also shared their condolences for De Witt’s family and praised his service. Gov. Kim Reynolds said she and her husband Kevin Reynolds, who is receiving treatment for lung cancer, were saddened to learn about De Witt’s passing, saying he was a “dear colleague and friend” who dedicated his life to serving his northwest Iowa community.
“In just three years, Rocky made a profound impact in the state legislature, all while heroically battling cancer,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Rocky was a dedicated husband and a loving father and grandfather. His family and friends remain in our prayers.”
Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner said in a statement Wednesday she and Senate Democrats were also sending support to De Witt’s family.
“My thoughts, and those of my Senate Democratic colleagues, are with the De Witt family this evening as they grieve the loss of their loved one,” Weiner said. “Sen. De Witt and I may not have agreed on every legislative issue, but I always respected his dedication to his work for the people of Iowa, even while battling his illness.”
De Witt’s nephew, Kolby De Witt, said in a statement posted on social media that his uncle took his public service in the Iowa Senate and on the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors seriously.
“The two positions Rocky held were honors that he did not take for granted,” Kolby DeWitt wrote. “Rocky understood that he was a caretaker of the two seats that he was elected to, and that they ultimately belong to Iowans. I consider myself blessed to have been part of Rocky’s family, and my opportunity to walk with him through the difficulties and triumphs of public service.”
A special election will be held to fill De Witt’s position in the Iowa Senate for the remainder of his term, until January 2027. The governor has until Monday to call for the special election.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rocky-De-Witt-black-background.jpg,,,2025-06-26 16:08:29.985150

Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association tried to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot to stop Ohio Senate Bill 1, but said they ultimately ran out of time.

“Over the course of the last few days, we were collecting over 4,000 signatures a day, and that momentum was only increasing,” said Youngstown State’s Ohio Education Association President Mark Vopat. “It was only because we ran out of time that we weren’t able to get the required signatures. … I believe that if we’d had just a little bit more time, we could have gotten those numbers.”
They needed to collect about 248,092 signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. 
Instead, they collected nearly 195,000 signatures and met the signature requirements in at least 33 counties, said Amanda Fehlbaum, a Youngstown State faculty member who helped champion efforts to get a referendum.  
The plan was to submit the collected signatures to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose on Thursday for him to verify the signatures. This was the deadline to submit signatures since the law goes into effect Friday. 
The new law creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“One thing is clear in all of this, the people do not want politicians making decisions about higher education,” Fehlbaum said. “The people do not like this legislation.” 
S.B. 1 quickly passed through the legislature earlier this year and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill into law on March 28. 
Fehlbaum said she thought another group “with infrastructure and funding” would come forward to challenge S.B. 1 after DeWine signed it into law, but that never happened so they decided to go the referendum route.
Vopat and Fehlbaum along with fellow Youngstown State faculty member Cryshanna Jackson Leftwich started the referendum process in mid-April and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and the Ohio Secretary of State’s office gave them approval to start collecting signatures May 5.
“I do think we could have pulled this off had we not wasted two weeks waiting on another group or groups to come forward,” Fehlbaum said. 
Vopat agrees they would have been able to get enough signatures if they had started the referendum process immediately after DeWine signed the bill into law. 
“That might have also given us the extra time we needed,” he said. 
The three Youngstown State faculty members said they are figuring out next steps and considering efforts to potentially try to get on the ballot in 2026. 
“This is not the end for us,” Jackson Leftwich said. “I want people to know that we’re going to use this momentum.”
More than 1,700 people volunteered to collect signatures across the state. They ended up raising more than $43,000 in small dollar donations with $1,000 being their largest donation, Fehlbaum said.
“I cannot underscore how much we did not have money,” she said. “We did not have paid consultants. We did not have paid petitioners. None of us are getting paid. …  There’s no dark money here.”
But they said it ultimately came down to a lack of time, not a shortage of money.
“I would love to take these boxes of petitions and put them on Jerry Cirino’s front door as a visible symbol of how detested this legislation is by the people,” Fehlbaum said. “We’re instead going to spend some of our remaining campaign funds on a shredding service so that information voters shared with us will not be mishandled.”
Cirino is the Republican Ohio state senator who introduced S.B. 1. 
Some of Ohio’s public universities have started making decisions because of the new law. Ohio University announced it will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center, and the Multicultural Center.
The University of Toledo is suspending nine undergraduate programs. Kent State University is closing its LGBTQ+ Center, Women’s Center, and Student Multicultural Center.
Referendums are rare and the last one that passed in Ohio was when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law in 2011.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana’s colleges and universities are bringing home hundreds of millions for construction projects and other key priorities, including over $30 million to begin construction for the long-anticipated new LSU library. 
The state budget for fiscal year 2025-26, which starts next week, includes approximately $610 million in immediate construction for higher education and around $75 million for research, campus security and other special projects. 
Funding for the state’s four higher education systems remained largely the same as what they received for the current school year, but each got at least a little one-time money in the three main budget bills Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law this week. 
Building boon 
The state construction budget, detailed in House Bill 2, provides allocations for each state university system, including a significant investment for a new LSU library at its main campus. The bill includes more immediate money for campuses than the previous year, and it lays out promised funds for upcoming years. 
The amounts universities receive fluctuates from year to year because their construction projects need more or less money, depending on what phase of construction their projects have reached. 
Projects in the LSU System are slated to receive about $196 million next year, up from $186 million this year. In addition to about $33 million for the first phase of construction of its library, which should begin next summer, around $28 million has been allocated for a new science building, and another $28 million was set aside for renovations at the Medical Education Building Laboratory at LSU Health Sciences New Orleans. 
The Southern University System will receive about $144 million, up from about $67 million this year. The largest portion, $47 million, will be used for a new science, technology, engineering and math complex at its main campus in Baton Rouge. 
The University of Louisiana System is slated to receive around $175 million, up from $136 million this year. That includes $17 million to renovate a major academic building at Louisiana Tech and $15 million for renovations to the Health Science Complex at the University of Louisiana Lafayette. 
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System will receive around $31 million, down from about $34 million this year. Its biggest project is $14 million for a new building and campus development at Baton Rouge Community College

Extra cash 
Each system is slated to receive lagniappe for special projects, research, athletics and campus improvements. 
The LSU System will receive $7.5 million to help replace lost federal research funding. 
In the University of Louisiana System, Grambling State University has been allocated $6.7 million for an athletic facility, McNeese will get $250,000 for its baseball and softball programs and another $225,000 for its athletic department. Nicholls was budgeted $500,000 for its athletic programs, and the University of Louisiana Monroe will receive $2 million for its pharmacy school.
The Southern University System will receive $1 million for night classes at Southern University New Orleans and $295,000 for a mobile health unit at Southern University Shreveport.

The state’s minimum wage will rise to $13 in July. (Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The minimum wage will increase in 15 states and cities in July, though lawmakers in other states have worked to slow down wage hikes.
Wage floor increases beginning July 1 in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will benefit more than 880,000 workers by collectively raising their earnings by more than $397 million, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
In Alaska, the $11.91 minimum wage will increase to $13 per hour. Oregon’s $14.70 standard figure will rise to $15.05 (the state has separate rates for urban and nonurban counties). And the $17.50 minimum in the District of Columbia will move to $17.95.
Another dozen cities will see minimum wage increases this summer, including Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Currently, 30 states and D.C. have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
In many states, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted upward as inflation rises. But voters in several states last year elected to significantly increase their minimum wages.
Voters deliver mixed verdicts on increasing minimum wage, but support paid sick leave

The institute noted that lawmakers have pushed to “water down” some of those voter initiatives.
In Missouri, for example, voters approved a November measure to mandate paid sick time for many workers and boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026, with future hikes tied to inflation. But lawmakers in May eliminated the sick leave requirement and nixed the inflation adjustment, meaning the minimum wage will not automatically increase as voters approved.
“Our side of the aisle has great concern for the burden that this would place on businesses,” Missouri Senate Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican, said in May about the ballot measure, “and if we’re going to promote economic growth and jobs, we need to really be cognizant of that.”
Similarly, Nebraska lawmakers this year aimed to cap future wage increases approved by voters in a 2022 ballot measure. That legislation failed to advance.
Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a national network of business owners and executives, said in a Thursday news release that increased minimum wages are good for employees and businesses alike.
Steven Dyme, CEO of Flowers for Dreams, said higher base wages encourage low-wage workers to spend more locally. The flower store has locations in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.
“Building our business with living wages has ensured the best floral talent, a product quality that’s truly cared for, and a trusting customer base,” he said in the news release.

CHICAGO — In a hot gymnasium on Chicago’s South Side, Gov. JB Pritzker announced Thursday morning he’s running for a potentially historic third term as governor.

In his announcement speech, Pritzker said he is running to “protect” the story he’s been telling about Illinois — one that has been built largely in opposition to the politics of President Donald Trump.

Pritzker said his third term would focus on grappling with artificial intelligence, addressing the rising cost of living, continued spending on infrastructure and growing the state’s economy.

The field house at Grand Crossing Park where Pritzker launched his first campaign hosted a crowd of Pritzker’s invited supporters, including Democratic party officials, campaign operatives and long-time Pritzker supporters.

Pritzker’s message has often focused on what Democrats need to do to win and push back on Trump, including addressing economic issues for the middle class and being outspoken against Trump’s policies.

“While it is certainly tempting to lay all of this at the feet of the megalomaniac narcissist in the White House and his malignant clown car in Congress, the hard truth is, we all share some of the blame,” Pritzker said.

The governor said “we must reckon with the fact that everything is too damned expensive,” but taking a shot at Republicans, said enacting budget cuts to key government programs like Medicaid that make life more affordable for people shouldn’t be the solution.

The governor also said a third term would continue his past efforts to protect abortion rights, diversity programming in the private sector and teachers’ ability to teach “uncensored history.”

Pritzker’s progressive stances on hot-button national issues are part of what has grown his national profile since President Donald Trump took office in January.

The governor has been one of the president’s most vocal Democratic critics and his schedule has been loaded with national media interviews and campaign speeches around the country.

From reelection to presidential election?

A successful reelection could set the stage for a bigger one: Pritzker’s speculated 2028 presidential campaign.

Pritzker on Thursday downplayed the possibility when speaking to reporters but didn’t explicitly rule it out.

“Everything that I do, truly everything that I do, in my job and every day when I wake up is about improving the lot of the people who live in the state of Illinois, lifting up the working families of Illinois,” Pritzker said. “Whatever I do going forward is going to be about that.”

He had a small taste of presidential campaigning last year when he was considered as a running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris, then served as a surrogate.

“You don’t get on that list unless they think you actually could be president of the United States and do the job if you had to,” Pritzker told reporters last year.

As some Democrats have tried finding a centrist message, Pritzker has stayed in the left lane. He condemned politicians, without mentioning specific names, who abandon their core beliefs for political gain.

“Of all the unbecoming qualities that Americans hate in their politicians – they hate cowardice the most,” Pritzker said. “I’d rather lose standing up for what I believe in than win by selling out those who believed in me.”

As Pritzker rattled off a list of accomplishments in his more than six years as governor, his message remained the same as it has since he launched his first campaign in 2017 to unseat an unpopular Republican incumbent: fight.

“Let me be clear: There is no Mission Accomplished banner to stand under today,” Pritzker said alluding to a premature victory declaration former President George W. Bush made in a 2003 speech regarding military action in Iraq. “Yes, we have addressed so many of our old problems – but new ones always arise. History is an endless relay race. Our job is not to look for the finish line but to protect the baton as we run our assigned leg. But we have work to do. I have work to do.”

Pritzker argued his success has come through embracing his role as a cheerleader for the state, recalling the negative perceptions of Illinois, such as the prevalence of corruption and unbalanced budgets, that had consumed state politics.

“When I was first elected, I told you I was prepared to be a happy warrior on behalf of our state, even if it meant going it alone,” Pritzker said. “I suited up to face the carnival barkers and misery spelunkers and doom grifters. I handed out optimism like a shot of Malört – as a swift jolt to the heart.”

First three-term Democrat?

The 60-year-old Democrat enters the race as the favorite, having received more than 54% of the vote in the 2018 and 2022 elections.

An heir to a fortune built on the Hyatt Hotel chain, Pritzker’s net worth sits at $3.7 billion as of Thursday, according to Forbes. His vast personal wealth makes him one of the richest politicians in American history and gives him a significant leg up on competitors. Pritzker dumped $350 million into his first two campaigns and has never taken outside contributions.

Separately, Pritzker has used an undisclosed amount of his personal fortune to fund a political action committee, Think Big America, to support abortion rights in other states.

Pritzker is also entering unchartered territory for Illinois governors. If he completes his current term, he would be the first Democrat to serve two full terms in modern state history. If he wins reelection, he would be the only governor to serve more than two terms since Republican Gov. Jim Thompson served four terms from 1977 until 1991.

Pritzker will need a new running mate first, however, as Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton is running for U.S. Senate. Pritzker did not announce a running mate Thursday.

Pritzker’s governing record

The governor’s top priority for his second term was to eliminate child care deserts and make preschool more accessible. Since he was sworn in in January 2023, the state has implemented Pritzker’s Smart Start initiative to expand preschool offerings around the state and has begun to phase in a new Department of Early Childhood.

When asked about those goals after his speech Thursday, Pritzker said there were an “awful lot of things” that his administration still needed to accomplish.

“We still need to get to universal preschool. We're on our way. It'll happen probably in 2027,” Pritzker said.

But Pritzker pointed to several of his progressive policy wins Thursday, in his speech and when speaking to reporters.

He has signed legislation raising the minimum wage to $15, legalizing recreational cannabis, banning assault weapons and numerous new protections of abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned three years ago. Pritzker also passed landmark legislation to phase out fossil fuels in the electricity sector.

Pritzker repeatedly brought up cleaning up Illinois’ fiscal house. The state has recorded budget surpluses in recent years and has received nine credit upgrades since he took office.

But challenges are also growing. The budget has gotten tighter, and lawmakers have resorted to more than $1 billion in targeted tax increases over the last two years to balance the budget. The fiscal year 26 budget Pritzker signed this month increased discretionary spending by less than 1%.

There’s also been headaches over legislative priorities. Labor unions are frustrated Pritzker didn’t embrace their proposal for pension reform this spring. And many parts of the governor’s legislative agenda hit roadblocks with concerned lawmakers. There’s also ongoing discussions about achieving Pritzker’s bold clean energy goals as prices rise and energy supply is strained.

The governor has taken pride in growing state agencies decimated by the two-year budget impasse that began a decade ago. But problems at those agencies have caused trouble for Pritzker.

An audit revealed the Department of Public Health failed to intervene to stop deaths from COVID-19 at the LaSalle Veterans’ Home in 2020, though Pritzker blamed and fired leaders at the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Billions of pandemic relief dollars at the Department of Employment Security went to fraudsters, while the Department of Children and Family Services faced years of scrutiny over deaths and the its failure to properly house children in its care while Pritzker maintained support for the department’s director.

GOP criticizes ‘stepping stone’ approach

As problems have mounted at the Statehouse, Senate Republicans have encouraged Pritzker to “think Illinois.” As he announced his campaign Thursday, Illinois Republicans continue to believe his focus is elsewhere.

“These last nearly eight years under his governance merits firing not rehiring,” Illinois GOP Chair Kathy Salvi said in a statement. “While businesses and families flee, Pritzker sees Illinois as nothing more than a stepping stone for the White House.”

A field of Republican challengers is still taking shape. So far, DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick, Posen Park District Commissioner Phil Perez and Lake Forest businessman Joe Severino have announced they will run in the Republican primary.

(Getty Images)The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported Thursday two more measles diagnoses in the state, bringing the total case count to five.
One of the cases was detected in Utah County, while the other is from the southwest health district, which serves Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, the department said in a news release. One of the new diagnosed patients is a minor and the other, an adult.
Like the previous three confirmed cases, the patients were unvaccinated. But, these additional patients were linked to previously diagnosed individuals rather than community exposure. Public health officials are conducting investigations to determine whether there are any additional cases in the state as national outbreaks keep on increasing.

Two of the five cases are unvaccinated, pregnant Utahns. According to the department, individuals infected with measles during pregnancy are at high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or giving birth to a child who will experience serious medical problems. Pregnant women are also “much more likely to be hospitalized because of severe measles.”
First measles case confirmed in Utah amid national outbreaks 

“The department recommends that if you are planning to become pregnant, get vaccinated before you get pregnant to protect yourself and your baby,” DHHS officials wrote in the release. “You can’t get the MMR vaccine while you are pregnant. If you get the MMR vaccine, wait at least 4 weeks after you get your shot before you try to get pregnant.”
As of Thursday morning, two of the Utah patients had been hospitalized due to complications from the virus but have since been released.
Measles early symptoms show up seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever higher than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough, runny nose or red eyes. A rash could appear four days after the fever starts. Health officials recommend that people experiencing these symptoms stay away from others and call health care providers before making a visit to avoid spreading the virus.
“The most effective prevention against the measles is vaccination. Public health officials in Utah want to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation,” according to the release. ” The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective against measles when the person gets 2 doses.”

(Photo via Getty Images)The tax and spend legislation going through the U.S. Congress could reverse New Mexico’s raises for health care providers who serve Medicaid patients called “provider rate increases.”
The unsettled fate of the Medicaid provisions amid rulings against their inclusion by the U.S. Senate parliamentarian leaves New Mexico waiting to see what its fate will be as a state with a heavier stake in Medicaid than any other.
In January, New Mexico started paying health care providers who serve Medicaid patients at 150% of the rate paid by Medicare, with the goal of providing more people primary, maternal and behavioral health care.
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee told state lawmakers on Thursday that the U.S. Senate’s version of the bill would require states to bring hospital rates down to what Medicare pays.
“That would be another big hit,” Sallee said at the LFC’s meeting in Taos. “The hospitals just barely got this program up and running.”
The expanded payments started going out in the last few months, Sallee said, and have helped stabilize rural hospitals in particular. But it’s “a big unknown” if those payments will be upended, he said.
Sallee said his staff is researching a concern raised by the state Health Care Authority, which runs the state Medicaid program, that these payment caps would apply to other kinds of services like primary care, maternal care and behavioral health care. He said he has asked to meet with U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján’s office next week about the issue.
New Mexico has allocated more than $2.2 billion for provider rate increases over the past couple of years, Sallee said.
“That would go away,” he said. “So that has significant implications for our health care system going forward.”
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) asked why the federal government cares if New Mexico pays higher rates, and whether it has anything to do with matching what states pay out. Sallee said yes, particularly in states like New Mexico that have expanded their Medicaid programs.
“That’s the majority in Congress’ thinking: ‘Why should we pay so much?’” he said.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In a move quickly panned by licensed health care providers, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Thursday that he planned to “Make Oklahoma Healthy Again” by urging state agencies to stop supporting public water fluoridation, removing red food dyes from school and prison meals, and by asking the federal government to approve a request that bans food stamp recipients from purchasing soda and candy.
Stitt’s pledge came minutes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s secretary of Health and Human Services, criticized the state for having the 47th worst health outcomes during a raucous “MOHA” kickoff rally that drew hundreds of people to the state Capitol.
Oklahoma has become the latest conservative state to submit a waiver to the U.S. Department of Agriculture that seeks to ban the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients from using their benefits to buy sodas, candies and other confectionery items, Stitt said. Tax dollars will no longer “continue to fund foods that are making people sick,” he said.
State officials will also work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to find more ways to promote healthly eating and to make food stamp funding go further. 
“Eating healthy foods today is going to reduce health care spending and dietary related illnesses later on in life,” Stitt said.
The Republican governor also said he’s instructed the Oklahoma State Department of Health to stop recommending fluoride in public water.
“Cities and water districts, they can still choose to do what they want, based on their constituents and the science, but it’s no longer going to be a recommendation for the state health department,” Stitt said.
And Stitt said he’s instructed all state agencies that provide meals to Oklahomans to discontinue their use of artificial dyes. He also plans to convene an advisory counsel to recommend other changes that can improve health outcomes across the state.
Stitt’s plans immediately faced criticism from licensed medical providers who showed up en masse at the rally, holding signs reading “Support Evidence-Based Health Care”, “Encourage Immunizations” and “Protect Medicaid.” 
Dr. Steven Crawford, chair of the Oklahoma Alliance for Healthy Families, said it would be “disastrous” for children’s health to remove fluoride from water.
“We do know that appropriate public water fluoridation prevents cavities,” he said. “And how do you help children get better nutrition when they don’t have adequate dentition or teeth to be able to eat the food? So I am so sad that the governor is advocating removing appropriate fluoride from public water.”
Crawford, who practices medicine in Oklahoma City, said fluoridation of public water and immunizations are two of the major health benefits over the past century and have been critical to improving the state’s and nation’s health outcomes.
He said removing candy and sugary drinks from the list of approved food stamp items isn’t inappropriate, but Stitt neglected to mention that many recipients already don’t get enough resources to be able to buy healthy foods. The governor also didn’t discuss increasing food stamp funding to ensure children are getting adequate nutrition, particularly during the summer months when they are not eating at school, he said.
Kennedy, who participated in a staged, ceremonial executive order signing with Stitt, praised the governor’s actions. 
“I am so gratified by these actions that are being taken by Gov. Stitt to make Oklahoma healthy again,” Kennedy said.
Spectators heckled Kennedy throughout his speech that focused on America’s soaring rates of obesity, diabetes and autism, declines in the nation’s fertility rates and a drop in American teenage boys’ testosterone levels. Kennedy, who has been criticized as being a vaccine skeptic, did not mention immunizations during his address.
At one point, a state trooper could be seen escorting two bystanders from the crowd after one began shouting something unintelligible at Kennedy. A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the encounter.
Kennedy said when people ask him if he’s taking soda and sugary drinks away from the Americans, he tells them that they should have the right to drink a bottle of soda.
“We live in a country where we have individual freedom,” he said. 
The federal government just should not be paying for it, he said.
“We’re paying for them at the front end by buying soda for the poorest Americans, and then we’re paying for it (on) the back end with this diabetes, for Medicaid and Medicare,” Kennedy said. “And it doesn’t make any sense. We are poisoning the American people.”
He said electing leaders like Stitt will change the way we do things in the U.S. to give American children a better chance of growing up healthy.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The Delaware Department of Education has released details of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s policy for free and reduced-price meals for the 2025–2026 school year.
The policy ensures that children from households facing financial hardship will have access to nutritious meals through the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and After School Snack Program.
Schools will continue operating these programs under normal procedures and will collect applications for free or reduced-price meals, unless they are participating in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows certain schools to provide free meals to all students.

Parents and guardians will receive Meal Benefit Forms (MBFs) along with an informational letter.
To apply, households must complete and return the form to their child’s school.
The form collects details necessary to determine eligibility and may be verified during the school year. Information shared is confidential and used solely for program eligibility and verification.

Households not receiving SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) or DE-TANF (Delaware Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) must include the names of all household members, their income sources and amounts, and the signature and Social Security information of an adult household member.
Families receiving SNAP or DE-TANF must list their case number and the child’s name, along with the signature of an adult.
Children enrolled in Head Start, or those identified as homeless, migrant, runaway, or in foster care, automatically qualify for free meals.
Applications can be submitted or updated at any time during the school year.
Those dissatisfied with an eligibility decision can request a review or hearing through their school’s administrative office.
A copy of the full policy is available for public review at each participating school and its administrative office.
For more information, families are encouraged to contact their child’s school.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-2.29.22-PM.png,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)North Carolina House Republicans want more than a third of existing staff positions at the state elections office to be converted to jobs for political appointees, eliciting criticism about the politicization of voting administration. The proposed changes were unveiled in a bill approved by the House Elections Law Committee Thursday morning.
Sweeping changes the bill proposes would prohibit state and local election board members from encouraging voting and open a way for foreign nationals to contribute to referendum campaigns. Another provision would require members of the military and citizens voting from other countries to provide photo ID or sign a document saying why they couldn’t send one. 
Last year, the legislature cut the time voters would have to fix mistakes with their absentee or provisional ballots. If voters sign in at the wrong place or fail to provide an ID, they can contact local boards later to cure deficiencies. The new bill would give voters a little more time to send in a signature or photo, moving the deadline from Friday after Election Day to Monday after the election.
State Elections Director Sam Hayes told the House Elections Committee that House Bill 958 would allow him to reorganize the office the way he wants.
“These positions would just allow me the flexibility that I need to conduct that reorganization and make sure that folks that are surrounding me, certainly my direct reports and I, are aligned on the vision for the agency as I set forward,” he said. “But I want to assure everybody today that we are going to do this in a nonpartisan fashion.”
Democrats on the committee objected to having the main office overseeing elections convert 25 jobs to those where employees are hired and fired based on their politics. 
“That is a purge of the agency is what that is,” said Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake). 
Other than the director, the agency historically has had no political appointees because it should be the least partisan, he said. Employees who have worked in the office for years under Democratic and Republican administrations could lose their jobs for political reasons if the bill becomes law, he added.
The state Board of Elections switched from Democratic to Republican control under a new state law. The Republican board majority hired Hayes, who was House Speaker Destin Hall’s general counsel, to replace Karen Brinson Bell as executive director.
A rushed process
Democrats on the Elections Committee objected to voting on the bill because it was made public only hours before the General Assembly left for a weeks-long break. 
Republicans decided to push ahead with the measure, even though time for discussion and debate was cut in half because Chairman Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke) said the committee could use the meeting room for only 30 minutes. He said the committee could not move to one of the many other vacant hearing rooms. 
The short meeting left no time for public comment.  Members of the public booed as the meeting ended. Some had planned to speak. The bill now moves the House Rules Committee, but since lawmakers have recessed the 2025 session for a summer break, no further action is expected in the near term. House Speaker Destin Hall (R- Caldwell) announced prior to adjourning the session Thursday that no voting sessions will be held in the House until the week of July 14, at the earliest.
New elections board staff weigh in
Hayes said after the meeting that he didn’t ask for 25 jobs to be converted. 
“All I have asked for is some flexibility with some exempt positions,” he said. “I’m really looking at the leadership team — folks there that an agency head would rightfully expect to have around them.”
The bill would authorize a new signature verification pilot program for citizens voting by mail. The legislature mandated the first one in 2023. 
Brian LiVecchi, Hayes’ chief of staff, told the committee Thursday that there had been a problem finding a vendor with the initial pilot. 
“Essentially, the program never really did get off the ground,” he said. 
The Board of Elections did have trouble finding a vendor. But it eventually hired one, conducted the signature verification pilot for the 2024 primaries, and reported the results, which revealed significant problems. 
LiVecchi said after the meeting that he heard from some counties that the pilot could have been done better. 
Other changes
The bill includes a way for non-citizens, overseas companies, and U.S. businesses that are majority-owned by non-citizens or overseas companies to make political contributions. 
Federal law prohibits “foreign nationals” from making contributions in federal, state, or local elections. 
The House bill would allow these contributions to referendum committees if the money was generated in the United States and the decisions were made by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. 
The photo ID provisions for military and overseas voters are the outgrowth of GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin’s lawsuits attempting to overturn his opponent’s election victory.
A rule the Board of Elections had passed unanimously exempted these voters from the state voter ID requirements. However, state appellate courts said military and overseas voters need to provide photo ID. 
The bill also includes provisions that would prevent state and local election board members from making public statements promoting voter turnout. 
Ann Webb, policy director at Common Cause North Carolina called the provision “a red flag.”
“Everyone in our democracy should be encouraging participation, and that’s not a partisan issue,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4499-1-1024x366.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

(AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature approved seven studies on topics including property taxes, health care, higher education and housing production. 
Some of these proposals initially started out as bills to make policy changes to the issues that will now instead be studied first.
That was the case for LD 1770, which initially sought to both increase the property tax fairness credit and establish a Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force. 
The Legislature’s Taxation Committee struck the former piece but maintained the latter. Its members on both sides of the aisle agreed that they’d like to wait for the recommendations from this task force before making any major reform, so the committee unanimously rejected most of the other property tax bills it considered this year.
Bill started as rent relief but passed Legislature as study into tenant-landlord relationships

Pending the governor’s approval, other studies that are expected to begin before the Legislature reconvenes in January 2026 include LD 1023, which would continue the work of the Blue Economy Task Force that was established in the previous 131st Legislature to focus on developing Maine’s ocean-based economy.
“When the Blue Economy Task Force reconvenes, industry leaders of all stripes will continue their work to develop Maine’s emerging ocean-based economy, attract opportunity and strengthen the state’s largest and oldest heritage industry — our ocean,” bill sponsor Sen. Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) said in a statement. “From our harbors to the foothills, Maine’s future will greatly benefit from the continued efforts of the task force.”
Other studies will examine deed fraud prevention, strategies to reduce the cost of and accelerate the production of housing, the state’s public policy on higher education, the state’s health care delivery system and alternative pathways to obtain a license to practice dentistry. 
But lawmakers pushed off decisions on 23 other bills that proposed studies until next year.  
Bills that involve studies are placed on what’s referred to as the “special study table” to vie for legislative resources. The study table is managed by the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership. 
This table is separate from the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, though some bills were placed on both tables because they also included provisions that required appropriations from the general fund.
The property tax measure was placed on both tables because it sought one-time funds — $150,000 — to contract with an entity to provide research and analytical support for the task force. The appropriations committee approved the funding and the Legislative Council approved the bill’s the study elements ahead of its final passage in both chambers on Wednesday.
However, another bill that had been on both tables this year did not end up passing. 
LD 1640 sought to implement the recommendations of the Gagetown Harmful Chemical Study Commission, which studied the impacts of exposure to harmful chemicals on veterans who served at the Canadian military support base in Gagetown, New Brunswick as well as to reestablish the commission. 
While the Legislative Council approved the study elements of the bill, the appropriations committee left the bill — which had a $250,000 price tag for data consulting costs — on its table. 
The bill did not die upon adjournment, however, as the Legislature carried over all of the bills left on the appropriations table into next year. (See the full list here.)
The ‘study table,’ another dead end for bills this session

The Legislature also carried over all of the bills on the study table, so 22 other proposals to study a range of issues, such as an equitable energy transition for Maine’s workforce and the feasibility of establishing a dedicated state family court, have the opportunity to be approved next year. 
A bill that seeks to ensure the already required teaching of African American studies is effectively implemented across all Maine schools was left on both tables and is being carried over. 
Another bill that remains on the study table is LD 1649, which Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) attempted to move off of the table on Tuesday but failed to secure enough support. 
This bill, which Stewart sponsored along with bipartisan co-sponsors, seeks to establish a commission to study and recommend solutions for modernizing and improving the effectiveness of the Legislature. 
“It’s in no way directed at any party, person,” Stewart said, explaining that throughout his roughly five years serving on Legislative Council, the body has made some adjustments but not done a thorough review of the legislative branch as a whole. 
Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) said she agreed with the need to do so, adding, “I think there is an appetite of those around this horseshoe that I haven’t heard before.” However she and the majority of the council ultimately rejected Stewart’s motion to move forward with it this year given its price tag, $14,860 in fiscal year 2025-26 and $22,196 in subsequent years.  
“We will get to do this all over again in the second regular session,” Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said on Tuesday after the council made its study decisions, “and there will probably be more added to the list.”

The Supreme Court just undercut that.,Shefali Luthra | The 19th,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/planned-parenthood-patients-medicaid-supreme-court/,"South Carolina can block Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid funds, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision on Thursday.","This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.  Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
South Carolina can block Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid funds, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision on Thursday — a major step toward the longtime conservative goal of “defunding” the nation’s largest family planning provider.
The case, Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Carolina, concerns a 2018 order from the state’s Republican governor that barred any clinic providing abortions from getting payments through Medicaid. Medicaid, which insures low-income Americans, does not cover abortions in most states, including South Carolina. 
Medicaid is the largest source of insurance for pregnant people in the country, and most people who get health care at Planned Parenthood clinics also rely on it. Planned Parenthood provides a range of services, including contraception, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted infections. In South Carolina, almost 60 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are people of color. About 400,000 are women between the ages of 15 and 44. 
Reproductive health clinics, including Planned Parenthood, typically operate on thin financial margins. In South Carolina, the loss of Medicaid funding could force clinics to turn patients away or to charge them for services that once would have been covered. 
Though Medicaid covers millions of Americans, health facilities typically aren’t required to accept it. Without Planned Parenthood as an option, patients insured through the program could struggle to find health care providers who accept their insurance, let alone ones they trust and feel comfortable with.
The court’s ruling undercuts a key provision of federal Medicaid law: Beneficiaries are allowed to use that coverage at any qualified health provider who agrees to accept it. 
The ruling currently only applies to South Carolina, where abortion is already outlawed after six weeks of pregnancy. However, it offers a template to lawmakers in other states. Already, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas are enforcing laws that disqualify Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. 
President Donald Trump, while promising to leave abortion policy up to individual states, has said he supports policies eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood, most of which comes through Medicaid. 
In Washington, D.C., where Republicans control both chambers of Congress, senators are considering a budget bill that would prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid dollars. Another version of that bill has already passed the House. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that policy could increase the deficit by $300 million over 10 years, thanks to patients missing preventive care and requiring more expensive follow-up treatment later on for conditions such as cancer and sexually transmitted infections, as well as through unintended pregnancies.
Already, many reproductive health clinics have been forced to slash their budgets, thanks to an April move by the federal government to withhold millions of dollars of family planning grants across 22 states. Those grants would have been disbursed through the federal Title X program, which supports family planning clinics that serve low-income people. Planned Parenthood is the largest single Title X provider, and nine of the 16 grantees affected were Planned Parenthood clinics.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP_PlannedParenthood_2022-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

The charges accused Jones of stealing $750,000 from a home rehabilitation program he was supposed to be administering while turning away needy rural residents living in crumbling houses. 
But his defense attorney attacked holes in the case, and last month, a local jury found Jones not guilty of the criminal charges. Now, the state has made no indication it will bring a civil case to try to claw back the money from him.
Jones’ nonprofit Tunica County Housing Inc. secured a subcontract with the county through the North Delta Regional Housing Authority in 2014 to run the county’s home rehabilitation program funded with casino revenue. For his work, vetting applications and managing expenses, Jones earned $12,000 a month.
At the core of the criminal case were “strange money transfers” and a finding that several of the people whose applications for home rehab were approved allegedly never received any repairs to their homes. According to the auditor’s office, investigators found less than 20% of the nearly $2 million Jones’ nonprofit received went to the contractors working to rehab homes.
“Once again, an arm of government trusted a private organization to run a government program, and a large percentage of the program’s spending was flat out stolen,” State Auditor Shad White said in a press release after the arrest.
Attorney General Lynn Fitch echoed White, saying, “These funds – hundreds of thousands of dollars – were meant to help the elderly, handicapped, and poverty stricken. But the funds never got to the vulnerable citizens who needed it most.”
Jones’ lawyer Carlos Tanner explained to Mississippi Today that the program operated with an extreme backlog, and that “some of the people they were claiming didn’t get their houses done actually did” by the time the trial was held this year.
The program was poorly administered, Tanner said, meaning that even if a person’s application was approved and a rehab contract prepared, county officials could direct Jones to put someone else’s repair job ahead of his or hers.
“But just because it was run like a first weekend lemonade stand does not mean Mardis Jones stole money,” Tanner said.
Tanner said the investigators gathered paltry evidence, only looking at details that fit their narrative. While Jones did earn a large salary through his contract, Tanner said prosecutors never presented evidence that Jones converted money that was supposed to be used on home rehabilitation to his personal use. 
Investigators got a warrant to seize Jones’ electronics, Tanner said, but “they never bothered to search it.”
“The two OSA (Office of the State Auditor) officials who were running the investigation, I questioned them about it during trial, and neither of them could tell me where the computer was, where the phone was, or what the contents were,” Tanner said.
Jacob Walters, a spokesperson for the auditor’s office, defended the way the investigators handled the case, saying, “The state auditor’s office is never going to turn a case we investigated over to a prosecutor unless we’re fully confident in the work that we did.”
At the time the auditor’s office announced the Jones arrest, it also said it delivered a demand letter ordering Jones to repay over $1 million, the money it alleged he stole plus interest and investigative expenses.
It’s up to the attorney general or local district attorney to decide how to prosecute auditor investigations, or in Jones’ case, what happens to the civil demand now that a jury found him not guilty in the criminal case.
When a person receives a demand alongside his or her arrest, regardless of what happens with criminal charges, the claw back can be enforced through civil litigation — much like the case against several defendants in a stunning Mississippi Department of Human Services fraud case, which began in 2020 and has yet to be resolved. Walters said the demand against Jones is still the office’s next-largest in history, second only to the welfare scandal.
The government might choose to pursue civil litigation, even if criminal prosecution is unsuccessful, because there is a lower burden of proof to win civil cases.
But the attorney general’s office told Mississippi Today last month that it had not received the Jones demand letter from the auditor, meaning it has nothing left to enforce.
Walters said the auditor’s office sent the letter along with the case file four years ago, but that with a turnover in attorneys prosecuting the case, the auditor had to resend the file last year. If the attorney general’s office no longer possesses the demand document, Walters said, “it’s an incredibly easy problem to resolve.”
“Just reach out to us with a single phone call or email and we can get it to you,” Walters said.
After the interview, the auditor’s office sent the demand letter by email, and the attorney general’s office confirmed it was received.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195429/Linda-Harris1.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

David M. Dye, who owns residential property at 1618 and 1624 Park St. in Keokuk, and Steve L. Andrews, who owns property at 1710 and 1714 Park St., are suing Roquette America, a corn syrup and corn starch producer located less than 1,000 feet away from the Park Street residences on South 5th Street in Keokuk.
In their lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the two men allege that due to recent developments at the Roquette plant, they’ve been damaged by a “significant” increase in odors emanating from the site. They allege that prior to the recent changes, the odor from the plant was “negligible and typical of an Iowa town.”

Court records indicate the plant was built about 122 years ago. However, the wastewater treatment facility on the site wasn’t constructed until 1977. In 1991, Roquette purchased the plant, and in 2013, Roquette allegedly began expanding its wastewater treatment system. According to the lawsuit, Roquette created an “overflow tank” in 2023 that resulted in a near-constant “foul and offensive odor” once it became operational.
The lawsuit alleges the plant’s wastewater treatment is subject to separation-distance requirements that legally restrict its operations if there are habitable structures within 1,000 feet of the plant, unless a waiver has been signed by the nearby landowners. The lawsuit states Dye and Andrews don’t recall signing any such waiver.
“The odor far exceeds any typical normal operating procedural smells,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the smell is so severe that Dye and Andrews have had to leave their homes and stay in hotels, avoid using air conditioning or heating in order to prevent outside air from entering their homes, and avoid outdoor activities at home.
The odor, they allege, “contains harmful gases” that endanger their physical and mental health.
As recently as March 2025, the plaintiffs claim, the Keokuk Fire Department was able to detect levels of ammonia within Dye’s home and concluded the smells were coming from the Roquette plant.
Federal records show that in October 2024, Roquette agreed to pay $207,488 in civil penalties for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act related to the Keokuk plant. The company also agreed to donate emergency response vehicles to the Keokuk Fire Department as part of the settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
According to the EPA, the company stores more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, on site and failed to comply with regulations intended to protect the surrounding community from accidental releases.
In addition, the lawsuit claims, Roquette previously entered into a consent decree with the EPA over alleged violations at the plant.
The lawsuit, which was first filed in state court before being transferred to federal court, alleges negligence in the construction and use of the plant; the creation of a nuisance that has deposited silt upon homes and vehicles and destroyed vegetation; and trespassing through air contaminants that have “physically invaded” the plaintiffs’ property.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as an injunction permanently barring Roquette from diverting odor onto the plaintiffs’ property or interfering with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their property.
An attorney for the Roquette America declined to comment on the lawsuit Thursday, noting that the company has until July 24 to file its formal response to the allegations.

Pat Williams once said, “If you want to know who someone really is, give them power and see what they do with it.”
What our father did with his life was defend the underdog, protect our wild lands, defend the working poor, arts and culture, Native people, and children with disabilities. He served 18 years in Congress, more consecutive terms in the U.S. House than anyone in Montana history. During his lifetime, he remained devoted to serving the people of Montana and making it a better place for future generations.
 
      About this obituary 

This obituary was crafted by the family of Pat Williams. It has been lightly edited by the Daily Montanan staff. 


Williams was a proudly from Butte, Montana. He taught in the public schools and served as a state legislator.
Throughout his career, he was known to Montanans simply as “Pat.” For many years, Montanan’s were on a first-name basis with their elected officials, Jeanette, Lee, Mike, Max and Pat. After retiring from Congress, he returned home to serve as a faculty member at the University of Montana.
He was born in Butte in 1937, during the Great Depression. His colorful Irish family included his mother Libby Williams, his cousin Evel Knievel, and Sister Toni Harris, Prioress of the Dominican nuns. His working parents owned the American Candy Shop in Butte. Because of their round-the-clock schedule, he was raised primarily by his cherished Irish grandmother Lizzy Keough. In 1965, he married Carol Griffith Williams. Theirs was a 60-year relationship that stood beyond description. Carol has been a life-long advocate for peace and justice, mother to their three children. She was also Pat’s “Senior Advisor,” campaign insider, policy director, poll manager, strategy leader—and the first woman to serve as both Montana Senate Majority and Minority Leader.
Williams was first elected to the Montana House of Representatives from Silver Bow County in 1966. After serving two terms in the Montana Legislature, he worked as an executive assistant to Montana Congressman John Melcher. Montanans elected Williams to the House of Representatives for nine terms, serving from 1979 to 1997. His year-and-a-half-long “door-to-door” campaign set the standard for grassroots campaigns. Williams, himself, knocked on 51,000 doors across western Montana, alongside a dedicated staff who he respected and loved. Many of these staff stayed with Pat for years, becoming a part of the family.
During his time in Congress, he was a tireless champion for working people. He led trailblazing legislation that assisted middle-class families and ensured educational opportunities for every child. Williams sat on congressional committees for the Budget, Natural Resources, Education, Labor, and Agriculture. He was the Chairman of the committees on Post-Secondary Education and Labor Management, and he created the College Middle Income Assistance Act. He sponsored the Family and Medical Leave Act, which protects workers from losing their jobs while taking maternity leave or caring for a sick family member. It was the first piece of legislation signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Williams was also responsible for the legislation that created the American Conservation Corps, providing thousands of America’s young people with an opportunity to serve their country and pursue higher education. Every state now has a conservation corps. In 1985,
Williams was appointed Majority Whip under House leadership by Speaker Thomas “Tip” O’Neill.
Among his many legislative accomplishments were the Children with Disabilities Act of 1987, which he named after his god-daughter Keough Duffy. His legislation protected the Lee Metcalf Wilderness Area, located north of Yellowstone National Park, as well as the Rattlesnake Wilderness Area, north of Missoula. He led the successful effort to save the Bob Marshall Wilderness from oil and gas exploration and banned geothermal energy drilling near Yellowstone. In a 1987 floor speech supporting wilderness protection, he famously warned, “We’re not proposing wilderness for wilderness’ sake—we’re holding back the concrete tide that already threatens our birthright.”
Williams was a famously vocal champion for federal arts funding and has been credited with saving the National Endowment for the Arts. His staunch advocacy of the NEA garnered him national attention during the Culture Wars of the 1980s and 1990s. It was a remarkable undertaking during a very trying time for the NEA, which he called “America’s Little Badge of Courage.”
Williams said the opportunity to defend freedom of expression was one of the things for which he was most proud. When asked about President Donald Trump defunding the agency once again. Williams responded, “Art can flourish without politics. The reverse is not true. Arts reflect the diversity and pluralism of our society, which is free, and freedom is our bulwark against tyranny. You can burn a generation’s imagination by teaching them that art is something to fear.”
Pat worked tirelessly with tribal leaders to build Montana’s seven tribal colleges. Working together, they also established the high school on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation and the Two River Eagle School on the Flathead Reservation.
Upon his retirement from Congress in 1997, Williams immediately returned to Montana, where he resumed his role as a teacher and professor at the University of Montana. He taught courses in environmental studies, history and political science. He was a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Rocky Mountain West and a Trustee for the National Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, the National Association of Job Corps, and The President’s Advisory Commission for Tribal Colleges. He was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Student Loan Marketing Association. He led the development of Western Progress. Pat was responsible for the legislative creation of the Rural Disabilities National Research Lab and the Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, both at the University of Montana. In 2012, Governor Brian Schweitzer appointed Williams to the Board of Regents of the Montana University System.
In 2023, Williams was honored by the Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes with an Indian name, “cikʷsšn” or Shining Stone. The name was chosen “as a reflection of his public service and how he shines as a leader, storyteller and the charismatic way he inspires, shares wisdom and makes people laugh. Shining Stone is a reflection of the strong foundation he provides his family, Butte and all of Montana. He is the statesman many go to for wise advice from a true elder.”
He believed government could be a force for good, and that culture, wilderness and education were not luxuries—but rights. He never gave up on the American experiment, nor on the rugged promise of his home state.
In his later years, Pat said he still heard the call of the mountains walking with his dogs. He said, “Out here, we measure a man by how well he listens when there’s no one else talking.”
Williams is survived by his wife Carol, son Griff Williams, daughters Erin Williams and Whitney Williams, his daughter-in-law Christine Treadway, son-in-law Joe Easton, and his deeply loved grandchildren: Keelan Williams, Aidan Williams and Fiona Easton.
May his life inspire us to work for the public good, take care of each other and remember we have much more in common than that which divides us.
In honor of his distinguished career, Pat’s body will be lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda in Helena, Montana. The Williams family will host a celebration of his remarkable life in Missoula. Both events will take place in July. Details to follow.
Memorials can be made to the Pat Williams Scholarship for Artists at the University of Montana or The Williams Family Fund at the Montana Community Foundation.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pat_butte-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

Firefighters from about 10 towns surrounding Canaan spent more than eight hours subduing the fire on Monday.

The Ethan Allen lumber plant in Canaan was back operating in a limited capacity Tuesday after a major fire broke out the previous day, the company and Vermont officials said. The fire caused damage to the factory — which employs almost 100 people in the village of Beecher Falls — and required firefighting teams from two countries to tame the blaze. 
The fire erupted around 10:30 a.m. Monday after a compressor failed at the furniture maker’s Essex County plant, sparking an eight-hour blaze that emergency crews from Vermont, New Hampshire and Quebec finally subdued in the early evening.  
Vermont teams from Beecher Falls and Brighton were assisted by emergency responders from several other towns, including Dalton, New Hampshire; Colebrook, New Hampshire; Saint-Isidore-de-Clifton, Quebec; and Coaticook, Quebec, among others.
“We want to thank the brave fire crews that helped to put out this blaze and ensure the safety of all our associates as well as the safety of those who live around the plant,” Farooq Kathwari, president and CEO of Ethan Allen, said in a statement. 
“We are pleased to report that no one was injured,” Kathwari’s statement continued, “and although the damage caused will require some repair, we have restored power to a good portion of the plant and don’t anticipate significant delays in production.”
Lindsay Kurrle, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development, said in a written statement that the blaze required the factory to halt operations Monday but the damaged plant was up and running “in a limited capacity” the following day.
Named for the eponymous Vermont Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen Interiors was founded in 1932 and opened its Beecher Falls plant in 1936. The factory handles sawmill and machining operations and has about 95 employees, making it one of the largest employers in Essex County.

The company also has a furniture manufacturing plant in Orleans, which employs about 250 people, as well as facilities in North Carolina, Mexico and Honduras.
Kurrle said the company had already scheduled a “routine, one-week shutdown” for the Beecher Falls plant this month and now plans to use the time to repair damage caused by the fire and expects to be fully operational after the brief closure. 
“Ethan Allen officials tell us the fire could have been much worse,” Kurrle said. “They say they are grateful to firefighters for knocking it down and to community members who supported first responders by showing up with food and water as they battled the blaze that took more than eight hours to extinguish.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA).NEW ORLEANS – The Louisiana Anti-Hunger Coalition and New Orleans Health Department Director Dr. Jennifer Avegno expressed opposition to proposed changes to state food and health programs in the Congress’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” at a virtual news conference Wednesday.
The bill proposes increasing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP) work requirement age from 54 to 64 for able-bodied people without dependents and to lower the age of qualified dependents from 18 to 10. The bill also includes changes that would reduce enrollment in Medicaid and limit the number of providers who can participate in the federal health insurance program.
The U.S. Senate parliamentarian recently found that a proposal in the bill to implement cost-sharing for SNAP, shifting financial responsibility for the program to states for the first time, would have violated Senate rules. The Louisiana coalition, made up of food advocacy organizations, supports that ruling but has continued concerns  with the bill’s proposed cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.
Pat Van Burkleo, executive director of Feeding Louisiana, a nonprofit system of food banks across the state, said SNAP should be seen as an “economic development issue,” not as free handouts.
“Real fiscal responsibility means protecting programs that prevent deeper poverty, poor health outcomes and greater social instability,” he said. “SNAP is a bridge to help people in vulnerable situations.”

Dauda Sesay, founder and executive director of the Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants, said his family depended on food assistance after fleeing civil war in Sierra Leone as a teenager, eventually ending up in Baton Rouge.
“Today, through that support, I am giving back,” he said.
Sesay called the bill’s proposed changes a “weapon” against financially struggling families and children.
“We cannot call ourselves a free and modern society if we abandon the most vulnerable among us,” he said.
Dr. Avegno, health director of the city of New Orleans, said the city has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country. According to the mayor’s office, 21% of city residents receive SNAP benefits, and over 16% experience food insecurity.
Nearly 18% of Louisianians rely on SNAP to pay for groceries, including 360,000 children, according to the state’s Department of Children and Family Services.
“I think we’ve all felt the pain of rising food costs over the past few years, but those individuals who really rely on assistance to keep their families whole are going to be cut most of all,” Dr. Avegno said. “We can’t ‘make America healthy again’ by robbing millions of our citizens of ways to eat healthy food and avoid chronic disease that’s caused by poor diet.”
She added that the bill would inevitably place funding responsibilities on states.
“[The cuts] would increase the state’s contributions to the program, which our state, as well as every other state, can’t really handle in terms of the burden on our own budget,” she said.
Conrad Cable is the owner of Current Farms, a community farm in Marion. He spoke about the importance of programs like SNAP for small-to-medium sized farms that do not qualify for larger government subsidies.
“If any of these lawmakers advocating for these changes would come out here and work for a day on my farm, it would break them,” he said. “They are so out of touch from how hard Louisianians work and how hard it is to survive in this state whenever these programs are cut.”
On Tuesday (June 24), President Donald Trump posted on TruthSocial that members of Congress could not go on vacation for July 4 until the bill is on his desk.
Burkleo said he encourages voters to pressure Louisiana Senators John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy to oppose the bill, which is currently in the Senate and has not yet been passed by the House of Representatives. Both senators have expressed support for the bill.
Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, spoke about the proposal’s potential to disproportionately affect the Black community.
“This bill aims to strip us of the very services meant to close those disparities,” he said. “If you vote for this bill, you vote against the lives of every Louisianian, period.”
McClanahan noted that his organization is prepared to oppose the bill “at all costs.”
“The NAACP was born out of struggle, and we’re going to challenge this bill in the Capitol, in the streets, at the ballot box and in the courtroom,” he said. “This is not a request. This is a warning.”

Jenny Boelter, wife of Vance Boelter, released her first public statement Thursday condemning the assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Vance Boelter is accused by prosecutors of killing the Hortmans and shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, on June 14. 
“On behalf of my children and myself, I want to express our deepest sympathies to the Hortman and Hoffman families. Our condolences are with all who are grieving during this unimaginably difficult time, and we are praying daily for them,” Jenny Boelter wrote. 
Authorities found lists written by Vance Boelter with the names and addresses of Democratic public officials, suggesting the attack was politically motivated. Boelter is alleged to have impersonated a police officer, visiting the homes of Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope and Rep. Kristin Bahner in Maple Grove in addition to the Hortmans and Hoffmans. Rest and Bahner were not harmed.
Vance Boelter texted his wife and other family members in the early hours of June 14, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.” 
Jenny Boelter wrote that she and her family were “absolutely shocked, heartbroken and completely blindsided” by the attack and that it was “a betrayal of everything we hold true as tenets of our Christian faith.” 
The statement says that Jenny Boelter received a call from law enforcement on June 14 and met with agents at a gas station. She said she answered questions, provided requested items and cooperated with searches. 
“From the moment we were first contacted by law enforcement, we have fully cooperated with investigators and responded to their every request…We thank law enforcement for apprehending Vance and protecting others from further harm,” the statement said. 
Vance Boelter was arrested the day after the assassination and has been charged with murder by both Hennepin County and federal prosecutors.  
Jenny Boelter has retained legal representation from Halberg Criminal Defense, according to the statement.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis) North Carolina lawmakers are sending half a billion dollars to the western mountains for hurricane relief, reaching a long-sought compromise between the House and Senate just hours before they left Raleigh for weeks.
Both chambers unanimously approved House Bill 1012 on Thursday. Gov. Josh Stein is expected to swiftly sign it into law.
The final agreement puts $700 million total into the state’s Helene relief fund. And it appropriates $500 million of that money, leaving the other $200 million for future relief.
“It addresses immediate needs,” said Rep. Karl Gillespie (R- Cherokee). “It does not address all needs. There will be more to work on later.”
Private road and bridge repairs, which are ongoing, will receive $75 million as part of the bill. Another $70 million will serve to match federal funding for ongoing projects.
State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office will get $51.5 million to send out interest-free loans to local governments. And a separate $70 million grant program will help fund infrastructure in municipalities.
Farmers will also continue to see aid. A $25 million program will help reimburse damaged or lost farm infrastructure.
A host of natural resource and environmental programs will receive money: $15 million for wildfire prevention, $15 million for streamflows, $10 million for dam repairs and more.
School districts will also be eligible for $8 million in grants included in the bill to repair infrastructure or buildings damaged by the storm.
Absent from the final agreement is a grant program for small businesses. The longtime request from business owners and western lawmakers was part of the House’s proposal, but struck by the Senate.
“We have not done small business grants for the east,” Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters. “We just didn’t feel like it was something that we needed to do at this point.”
Democrats from Asheville and the surrounding county said the lack of grants would hurt the “economic engine” of the area.
“When we talk about ‘there’s more to come’ … for most of the small businesses impacted by the storm, it will come too late,” said Rep. Brian Turner (D-Buncombe). “And the ripple effects will be felt all across the region.”
Other large bundles of money will be directed toward relief under the bill. Almost $300 million for the Department of Transportation will be used for Helene repairs. And the package green-lights the use of $685 million in federal dollars for water and sewer infrastructure.
The House passed their version of the bill in May, sending a $464 million package to the Senate. It went untouched there for a month, until senators made major changes to the bill and pushed it through.
Senators’ prior plan was more expansive than their counterparts’. But it lacked key line-items like the business grant program, and redirected hundreds of millions in transportation money for relief efforts. Both changes prompted concerns from the House.
The Republican-led General Assembly has over the past year been reticent to send out money at the clip that Stein, a Democrat, has asked for.
But GOP lawmakers have touted their approach, which has now resulted in four substantive aid bills, as the proper line between fiscal responsibility and meeting needs in the west.



Still, that approach has encountered roadblocks and frustrated Democrats.
Slow-arriving federal money has made state efforts more urgent, as western North Carolina struggles to rebuild. And Democrats have frequently called for more robust investment to save the tourism-dependent mountain economy and ramp up recovery efforts.
Some remained exasperated Thursday with the final state of the aid bill.
“We need relief money in western North Carolina, so I’m going to vote for this bill,” said Rep. Lindsey Prather (D-Buncombe). “I’m really not happy with the way it ended up.”
The new aid deal means lawmakers have now spent $1.9 billion in state money on Helene recovery. Just over $1 billion of that has come through the two aid packages passed this session.
Ahead of the Senate’s vote Thursday, a local lawmaker urged those traveling in the coming summer months to consider western North Carolina.
“Please come. Spend your money,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe). “Because we need it.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-26 14:12:20.183907

Loeffler was CEO of Bakkt, a Georgia-based company that builds crypto technology for business use and a former owner of the WNBA team Atlanta Dream. She served as a Republican U.S. senator from Georgia from 2020 to 2021. During her time in the Senate, she touted a “100% Trump voting record.”
She was chosen as President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the SBA earlier this year. This marks Loeffler’s first trip to Iowa as SBA administrator.
“I’m thrilled to be part of this year’s Entrepreneur Expo led by Senator Ernst, and to work with her as Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee,” Loeffler said in the release. “President Trump knows that small businesses are our nation’s economic and innovation engine. This Administration is returning the focus to Main Streets in Iowa and across America to ensure they have the resources they need to succeed.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kelly-Loeffler-_-Jill-Nolin-GA-Recorder-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 14:12:20.183907

In a unanimous vote, the council approved a budget, reducing city staff but closing the previous $9.8 million budget gap.

BURLINGTON — The City Council unanimously approved a $107.1 million budget Wednesday for the 2025-26 fiscal year, closing a nearly $10 million gap through workforce reductions, new investments and a municipal tax increase. 
The new budget also addresses a $1.8 million shortfall discovered last week by increasing municipal taxes by $115 on a $500,000 home. However, Progressive Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said the hike will be offset by a reduction in education taxes.
“This budget reflects an unwavering commitment to affordability for residents here in the city of Burlington,” Mulvaney-Stanak said Wednesday. “It contains very critical investments in key priority areas for my administration, largely community safety and housing.”
The Howard Center Street Outreach program, which provides support for people in need of mental health, addiction, housing and social services, received increased funding. The council also allocated $50,000 to support senior programming.  
To balance the budget, Mulvaney-Stanak and her administration reduced the city workforce, which the mayor said grew unsustainably in the past nine years — adding 98 new full-time positions, including 37 funded with one-time money and no long-term plan to maintain them. The mayor also gave up her own cost-of-living salary increase in the next fiscal year, and her department heads won’t receive it for the first six months.
Mulvaney-Stanak mentioned inflation, cost-of-living adjustments, health care increases and possible tariffs among the challenges the council had to address to close the budget gap. 
“We were able to deliver you a budget that is decreased or reduced by more than 1%. When you compare the total to fiscal year [20]25, that is pretty rare out there in government,” Mulvaney-Stanak said.
City councilors expressed appreciation for the efforts to close the budget gap and the new investments, but also expressed unease about layoffs.
Councilor Carter Neubieser, a Progressive, advanced a motion to cut $100,000 allocated to the University of Vermont Health Network, presenting data on profits and assets to show that the hospital network would have enough money to cover this expense.
Councilor Evan Litwin also presented a motion to move $7,500 from the Howard Center Street Outreach program to the Turning Point Center of Chittenden County, dedicated to addiction recovery programs. 
Both motions were rejected by the rest of the councilors, who claimed these proposals required a more in-depth discussion and that it was too late to make new changes to the budget.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, early last month, told states it wanted records of all applicants and recipients for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since 2020. The records include names, dates of birth, addresses and Social Security numbers.
This triggered a lawsuit by nonprofit groups and others, and the department has since walked back its request. But some states did begin taking steps to hand over data.
The demand came in light of a March executive order from President Donald Trump telling federal agency heads to “ensure the Federal Government has unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding.” 
A letter to states said the rationale for getting the SNAP data was to “ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients.” 
The unprecedented move appears to be part of a broader effort to access state-held data that could be used to target immigrants without legal status. The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency had moved to combine data across the federal government under the auspices of rooting out fraud.
On a similar front, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security asked for state-level Medicaid data from the federal agency that oversees the program. Washington was one of a few states whose Medicaid data was shared, to the outrage of immigrant rights groups who have called on the governor to address their concerns. 
The federal government funds SNAP, which helps low-income residents pay for food, but states run it with the help of third-party payment processors. Recipients receive their monthly benefit on an Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, card. 
In Washington, that third-party processor is Fidelity Information Services. At least 20 other states also use Fidelity, which reportedly told its state clients it planned to cooperate with the Trump administration. The company gave states a deadline to provide consent to disclose the data.
The state Department of Social and Health Services, which runs Washington’s program, told Fidelity not to give the feds “any confidential information.”
“DSHS is complying with proper data requests sent directly to DSHS, subject to federal data and security protocols,” agency spokesperson Norah West said in an email Tuesday. “We are concerned about the potential for bypassing protections and processes that are already in place.”
“We have requested that USDA continue to send any requests for DSHS SNAP data directly to DSHS,” West continued. “We will evaluate each request and provide information as required by law.”
In March, the most recent month for which data is available, over 908,000 Washingtonians received a total of $168 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the program serves upward of 42 million people.
When advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over its attempts to access the data, they argued the federal government was exceeding its authority and violating privacy protections.
The Department of Agriculture has told the processors not to transfer over the data until they hear “requisite procedural safeguards have been met.”
Some other states, like Kansas and New Mexico, have similarly refused to comply, while others, including Alaska and Tennessee, have said they’re prepared to share the information.
Meanwhile, food stamps are threatened under the budget bill the U.S. Senate is currently considering. Estimates indicate tens of thousands of Washingtonians would lose some or all of their SNAP benefits under revised work requirements and other changes in that legislation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/snap-ebt-food-stamps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 14:12:20.183907

Dan McKee on June 26, 2025, for the ceremonial signing of a ban on the purchase and sale of assault-style weapons. The law goes into effect on July 1, 2026. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Starting July 1, 2026, Rhode Islanders will be barred from buying or selling certain military-style semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns — though those who already own them can still keep them.
Gov. Dan McKee signed the ban at the State House Thursday morning, flanked inside by gun safety advocates in red and orange T-shirts who have long pushed state lawmakers to ban such weapons.
“This is progress today and it will make Rhode Island safer for our families and for our neighbors,” McKee said. 
The legislation that went to McKee’s desk was the Senate’s version unveiled in the final days of the 2025 legislative session, which was a  scaled-back version of the legislation that passed the House.
“It wasn’t an easy process, it wasn’t a guaranteed success,” Senate President Valarie Lawson told the crowd of lawmakers and advocates
Violators of the ban face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and will have to forfeit their assault-style weapons.
Excluded from the new law are shotguns with detachable magazines, pistol grips and folding stocks along with most semi-automatic pistols.
The Senate’s rewrite also did away with a voluntary weapon certification program, which itself was amended from a mandate that grandfathered weapons be registered with law enforcement — a provision that drew the ire of pro-Second Amendment advocates.
McKee went as far as including the ban in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget — though legislative leaders like House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi were not keen on that maneuver.
“This bill belonged, it’s a very important issue, as standalone legislation,” Shekarchi told the crowd. “And the votes proved it.”

The Senate approved the bill 25-11, while the lower chamber approved it by 43-28 vote Friday night.
The compromise was met with some dissatisfaction from the Rhode Island Coalition against Gun Violence, whose leader took aim at lawmakers’ decision to no longer outlaw the possession of prohibited weapons. 
Executive Director Melissa Carden told reporters after the signing ceremony that it’s possible the perceived loophole could allow someone to purchase a weapon in another state where such sales are legal. She acknowledged that federal law prohibits firearm sales to residents of states where a particular weapon is banned, but said it’s ultimately up to the federal government to enforce.
“And at a time where the federal government is rolling back all kinds of gun safety programs, that’s a concern,” Carden said.
Still, she said the progress made by the state in eliminating the sale of weapons commonly used in mass shootings is worth celebrating.
“We never want another family or workplace torn apart by a preventable loss,” she told the crowd.
Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat who sponsored the House version of the ban, said he’s satisfied with what the General Assembly ultimately brought to McKee’s desk.
“Could it have been more? Sure,” Knight said in an interview. “But show me a bill that passes through this building where that’s not true.”

(Stock photo via Getty Images)Eight years after Christopher Hudrick was fired from the Des Moines Police Department and lost his certification, he is again able to work as a police officer.
His certification was suspended for a minimum period of three years from Sept. 1, 2020. Hudrick fought his termination, suing the Des Moines Civil Service Commission that denied his appeal for reinstatement but was ultimately unsuccessful. 
Hudrick was terminated after violating a last chance agreement in January 2017, after nearly 10 years with the Des Moines Police Department.
During his time, he accumulated a record of 11 reprimands and a total of 37 days suspended. These violations range from hitting an airplane with his squad car to failing to pull over for Iowa State Patrol, according to court records filed by the commission. 
“I’ve gone through a lot this whole process, I’ve grown, I’ve matured.” Hudrick said during his reinstatement discussion with the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy Council. “Since the past, I’ve been able to perform what I know to be what I love at a high level.”
His career
Growing up, Hudrick loved superheroes. He cites the stories of Spiderman and Captain America as a reason for he developed a passion for justice. 
“Heroes, they go out and save the day. They don’t do it because they have the power — they do it because they want to. Because they can go out and they can help people. Part of that always stuck in my head, I can go out and I can help people and I’m good at that because I can find a way to relate to somebody,” he said in an interview with Iowa Capital Dispatch.
He said he decided to become a police officer after 9/11. At the time, Hudrick had the day off from his job at a gas station, but was unexpectedly called in due to a huge influx of customers. 
“Cars were lined up for miles trying to get gas and they needed help at one of the other gas stations in town just down the road,” he said. “People were getting in fights over who gets gas next, so, I mean, it was chaotic. Everyone was freaking out and rightfully so.  But, the thing that dawned on me after that had all happened was that I didn’t freak out, I stayed calm amidst everything that was going on and was able to get things flowing smoothly.”
Following a conversation with a deputy from the Story County Sheriff’s Office, he applied to be a corrections officer at the local detention center. He applied “over and over and over again,” did well on his tests and did well in his interviews but he was never hired due to a lack of college education.
“I was like, ‘How much longer am I going to do this? I know what I want to do, how much longer am I going to put it off?’ So, I made the decision to go back to school so I could get my degree in criminal justice,” he said.
While taking courses, Hudrick was a member of the Criminal Justice Club, which allowed him to get “hands-on experience” with the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. He “really enjoyed” the training and his passion for law enforcement “kept growing.” By the time he graduated, he no longer wanted to be in corrections, he wanted to be a police officer.
Hudrick was hired by the city of Des Moines in 2007. In his nearly 10 years with the force he had several moments he looks back fondly on.
One day he got a call for an 8-year-old boy who was attacking workers and tearing up his room at a Youth Emergency Shelter. 
“When I got there, he actually wanted me to shoot him and kill him. He’s like 8 years old. He would make a sailor blush with his language. I mean, it was bad. So, I had to break down that barriers between me and him. You know, I’m a police officer and he hates police officers and he wants me to shoot him,” Hudrick said.
He spotted a Batman and Superman sticker on the kid’s wall. As a lifelong comics fan, Hudrick offered to pick up some graphic novels from the library if the boy would calm down and clean up his room. The boy didn’t believe him, but he went anyway. 
That same day, “The Incredible Hulk” star Lou Ferrigno, a “childhood hero” of Hudrick’s, was visiting the department. Rather than attending the appearance, he “put that aside,” to deal with the youth but calls it “one of the best, most rewarding things” he’s ever done. 
“He did change but then he would act up and get in trouble just so they would call me, because he wanted to see me,” he said. 
Following the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, in 2012, every time he dropped his daughter off at school, he would remain on campus until the last kid arrived to ease the worries of the family and faculty. For this, he received a letter of appreciation from the principal. He also received a letter of appreciation for “kindly and delicately” treating victims of a home invasion.
Hudrick said he prevented multiple suicides during his career, one of which he received a chief’s commendation for. 
“Coming from having a bit of a troubled childhood and home life, it helps me to relate to them. ‘I’m not in your circumstances but I’ve been in that circumstance.’ I can relate through my own experiences,” he said. 
Hudrick says these experiences and more “fueled that passion” he had for law enforcement.
His termination
“In my case, I’ve got a lot of experience. I’ve got a lot of experience with helping, I’ve got a lot of experience with making my mistakes but the most important thing is to own the mistakes and learn from them,” he said. 
In 2008, he received two written reprimands. In 2009, he was suspended for three days, a two-day suspension in July and a one-day suspension in October. In October 2010, he received a 12-day suspension for mishandling property. In July 2011, he received a written reprimand followed by a four-day suspension for a separate instance of misconduct. In September 2013, he received a one-day suspension. All disciplinary actions were accepted without appeal from Hudrick.
Among the violations are reprimands for hitting an airplane at an airport with his squad car, mishandling property, refusing to pull over for the Iowa State Patrol and driving in “emergency mode” without lights and sirens. His police chief called his disciplinary record “abysmal” in a letter to Hudrick, filed in court records on behalf of the service commission.
Hudrick notes in his reinstatement discussion with the law enforcement academy council that he “never had complaints with use of force, never any integrity issues or falsifying evidence.”
“It was based on me wanting to impress people,” he said. “Unfortunately, it was me just getting in my own way. Just hitting the gas and going like I had a rocket strapped to my back.” 
In 2015, Hudrick caused an accident, did not stop at the scene, as required by Iowa law, and failed to check on the condition of the driver he hit, according to court records filed on behalf of the service commission. The records also indicate that at the time, Police Chief Dana Wingert “was inclined to terminate Hudrick’s employment” but instead imposed a ‘last chance warning’ and a 15-day suspension.
Hudrick’s last chance warning indicated, “Any future incidents of misconduct of any kind including but not limited to the exercise of poor judgment, poor driving, inappropriate care of evidence, poor service, unprofessionalism, failure to perform assigned tasks, or otherwise failing to fulfill your assigned duties WILL result in your termination from employment.”
Following the incident, Hudrick notes at his reinstatement discussion, he sat down with “a really good mentor and officer Pat Hickey,” and determined that he “needed to slow himself down.”
“He told me to drive like the chief was in the car, so I did. And it worked, it really did work. I was able to respond to several different calls where instead of just hitting the gas, I pictured where it was at, the different ways it could go for suspects leaving the scene and then just went that way. I didn’t push the envelope, I didn’t get crazy or anything like that and time after time after time, it put me right in the exact right spot,” he told the council.
On Sept. 22, 2016, Hudrick responded to a call for police service where a couple had handcuffed themselves together and were unable to find the key, according to court records. He claimed that he and the couple laughed about the incident. After assisting the couple, he returned to his police car and took a picture of the Des Moines Police Department Mobile Data Terminal which displayed details of the call for service. He posted this image to Facebook with comments such as “arm to leg…you can’t make this stuff up folks?” and “you should have seen them hopping across the floor…lol.”
The post was determined by the Department of Professional Standards to be in violation of several department policies, related to professionalism and the dissemination of information. 
“It was really a brighter moment in what was going on at the time. Nobody in law enforcement was good in 2016,” he said at the reinstatement discussion. “That post wasn’t meant to make fun of them, it was meant to show a funny moment.”
In his reinstatement discussion, Hudrick notes that at the time he was affected by the passing of his squad members. Earlier that year, officers Carlos Puente-Morales and Susan Farrell were killed in a head-on collision with a drunk driver while transporting a prisoner from Council Bluffs back to Des Moines. He argued that 2016 was a “bad year” for law enforcement “no matter what you did.”
“What we do doesn’t stop at that moment. We still have to go out and do our job,” he said. “The grieving process isn’t something you get to fully actuate and get through.”
According to Hudrick, at the time of his termination, the department had yet to adopt a social media policy. The complaint against his post came internally and he was terminated for making a “news release” with his Facebook post.
On Jan. 6, 2017, Hudrick’s employment was terminated by Wingert.
Hudrick filed several appeals to argue his termination, first to the Des Moines Civil Service Commission, then to the courts. In both cases the termination was reaffirmed.
His eight-year hiatus
Before his certification was suspended, he had applied for jobs with the Iowa State Patrol,  as well as positions in Ankeny, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale and Carlisle. He notes that in applying to other jobs his past “always came back to haunt” him. 
“If it wasn’t for my wife, I don’t know if I would be sitting here. She’s supported me, she’s kept me grounded, she’s been nothing short of amazing in every sense of the world. That’s an understatement,” he said. “We’re still together after all this, after almost losing everything.”
Hudrick says he lost his ability to provide for his family. Going into law enforcement was also a means of securing a good job and losing that hit his family in a significant way. They were forced to cash in a large part of their retirement savings and relied on support from their family to stay “on dry land,” he said.
Following his termination, Hudrick worked for a year at Uber without any driving issues. After realizing he “needed something more sustainable,” he worked as a delivery route driver for FedEx for four years. When he began working there, he had an extended route that took him into southern Iowa — a 10-hour route Monday through Friday. He compiled no issues with his driving during this time. 
“Driving 10 hours a day gives you a lot of time to think and reflect,” he said in his reinstatement discussion. “So, it’s a lot of learning how to self check, getting my head where it needs to be and to be present in the moment, accepting the stupid things I did and learning from them.”
At FedEx, he transitioned to a route to Urbandale where he received a safe driving award. 
In 2022, he started working in production at Kemin industries but moved to “different departments within the company and learned new areas and new skills.”
But ultimately, Hudrick said, law enforcement is his passion. One of his main reasons for getting recertified after his eight-year hiatus, is to help newer officers who are struggling “to not go down that same path, where you just keep tripping over your own feet.”
His recertification
The reinstatement discussion for Hudrick was held by the ILEA on April 3, 2025. Hudrick was accompanied by his lawyer, Mark Hedberg, who represented him during his termination appeals in 2017. 
“To hear the stories on that side of the bench and the struggle that you guys have to come up with the right decision, pulling out the facts, sorting that out. It’s very humbling and very refreshing,” Hedberg said at the start of the reinstatement discussion. “The integrity of public safety is number one, your job is to keep the public on the right side and I think you’ve done a great job of that here in Iowa. Having said that, I support him wholeheartedly.”
Following his discussion, the board members had no comments other than board chair Ric Martinez commenting he had “been out of law enforcement for a while…but as we all know, police work is still police work.” 
Councilmember Dan Jansen motioned to grant the reinstatement for Christopher Hudrick stating the “reason for the suspension no longer exists and it is in the state’s best interest to fully return state certification.” 
All council members approved the reinstatement. 
Kristi Traynor, legal counsel to the ILEA, said board members would not comment on the reinstatement. In the reinstatement order, the council concluded that Hudrick “demonstrated his growth and maturity through stability in other employment,” and “further accepted responsibility for his behavior.” They added “there no longer continues to be public safety given the evidence of rehabilitation.”
A spokesperson for the Des Moines Police Department did not respond to a request for comment about Hudrick’s reinstatement.
He has not applied for a job since his reinstatement. He said “that passion hasn’t died,” but he wants to wait to confirm that “mentally” it’s something he can still do.
“It feels like home,” he said to the academy board members. “It’s what I am good with, I’m good with people. My mindset is that we’re not out there to mess with people, we’re there to help people,”

According to the health department, the facility currently houses approximately 400 people and employs 100 staff members. NMDOH will be supply the facility with personal protection equipment, test kits and measles vaccines. The new cases bring the total number statewide to 86, spread across eight counties. The other counties in which measles cases have been reported include: Lea, San Juan, Curry, Eddy, Doña Ana, Chaves and Sandoval.
Measles symptoms begin with a cough, runny nose and eye redness, before progressing to fever and rash that starts at the head before moving down the body. Health officials advise that people who have measles can infect others from four days before the rash appears and remain contagious four days after the rash is gone.
The health department encourages people with symptoms who have been exposed to measles to call NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for guidance in English and Spanish. If planning to see a doctor or visit an emergency room, call first so health care providers can plan for a visit by someone who may have measles.

She is the wife of James Meredith, the man who faced a violent white mob when he became the first Black student to enroll in the University of Mississippi in 1962.
More than 100 relatives, friends and admirers gathered Wednesday night at Hal & Mal’s restaurant in Jackson to celebrate Meredith’s 92nd birthday. Many posed for photos with him, and Judy Alsobrooks Meredith spoke on behalf of the family.
She said the new anti-DEI law will make educators reluctant to teach about her husband or other important figures including Medgar Evers, the Mississippi NAACP leader who was assassinated in Jackson in 1963, and his wife, Myrlie Evers, who is still living and who became a civil rights leader in her own right.
“Y’all better start teaching your kids and your grandkids who they are,” said Alsobrooks Meredith, as the Evers’ daughter, Reena Evers-Everette, stood nearby.
A federal judge heard arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit that seeks to block the anti-DEI measure, which became law when Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed it in mid-April.
The law prevents public schools from creating diversity, equity and inclusion offices; hiring people based on their race, sex, color or national origin; or engaging in “divisive” concepts, including teaching that a person “by virtue of his or her race, sex, color, national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive.”
Legislative Democrats argued that the restrictions will force teachers to minimize ugly parts of history, including slavery and segregation. Republicans who pushed for the law said DEI concepts divide people into victims and oppressors.
With restrictions in schools and universities, Alsobrooks Meredith said it’s more important than ever for people to share their own family histories.
“Young people, start recording when you hear old folks talking … when you hear your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother talking about some stuff, start hitting the record button. Just do that. You’ve got to preserve,” she said. “To say that Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers and James Meredith … they never existed. Well, that’s a lie born in hell.”

Ron DeSantis threw out the V word on Thursday and warned state legislators he is getting ready to use his line-item veto power.
During a lengthy press conference on higher education held on the campus of Florida Atlantic University, the Republican governor took shots at the Legislature for not passing a budget on time. He also noted that the final $115.1 billion budget includes enough local projects for individual lawmakers to leave him “kind of numb.”
He will have to sign the budget and use any line-item vetoes before July 1.
“Well, there obviously will be veto[es],” said DeSantis, who last year vetoed $949.6 million in projects from the budget that runs through next Monday. In 2023, the governor vetoed $510.9 million from the state’s spending plan and in 2022 he vetoed a whopping $3.1 billion.  
DeSantis’ remarks on the subject were brief but biting.
“I think those of you who follow state politics, legislative stuff, we’d thought we’d get a budget in early May. Fiscal year ends June 30. They didn’t quite do that and they ended up producing one probably about 45 days after the deadline — which, you know is their prerogative to do. The reality, though, is there’s a lot to go through. So we’ve been going through it. I mean like I’m kind of numb with all the different line items that are in it.”
The GOP-led Legislature failed to pass the budget during the regular 60-day session. Leaders agreed to an extended session and on June 16 approved a $115.1 billion budget and a $1.3 billion tax cut package. The 2025-26 budget is $3.5 billion smaller than this year’s and half a billion less than DeSantis proposed spending.
The House and Senate also agreed as part of the budget to direct for the next two years $1.5 into the Budget Stabilization Fund to weather a potential recession. The emergency fund could help Florida get through the looming federal funding cuts. 
The Senate unanimously voted for the budget, whereas two Democrats in the House voted against it.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have pointed to that statement as to why they want him brought back to Maryland.Maryland argumentsIn Maryland, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers say they want to ensure he is not deported again.“This motion does not ask this Court to adjudicate Abrego Garcia’s custodial status in the Tennessee criminal proceedings; that is for the Tennessee district court to resolve,” they write.“Nor does this motion seek to alter any of the conditions of release set by the Tennessee district court or otherwise interfere with the Tennessee criminal proceedings. This motion simply seeks to ensure that when Abrego Garcia is released from criminal custody, he returns to, and remains in, this District (other than to travel to Tennessee as needed), until further order from this Court.”Abrego Garcia lives with his family in Maryland. “Maryland is where he was on March 12 at the moment his unlawful removal saga began, when ICE agents with ‘no warrant for his arrest and no lawful basis’ arrested him and locked him up at an ‘ICE facility in Baltimore, Maryland,’” the complaint says.“Returning Abrego Garcia to Maryland implements the Supreme Court’s directive and safeguards this Court’s jurisdiction in this matter,” it adds.Clashes between administration and judgesAbrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation drew national attention to the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportations campaign that some judges have found skirted due process rights for immigrants. The White House has clashed with the judicial branch with some frequency over immigration decisions.The Trump administration this week has, in an unusual move, sued the entire judicial bench of the District Court of Maryland, including Xinis, over a standing order to require a two-day pause for deportations due to a high volume of habeas corpus claims from immigrants challenging their detention in the state. A habeas corpus claim allows immigrants to challenge their detention.Abrego Garcia has had deportation protections from his home country since 2019, but in March he was arrested in Maryland by federal immigration officials while driving his son home and informed his status had changed. Days later, he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, a move the Trump administration admitted was a mistake.In April, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration had to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States, but stopped short of requiring it.For the next two months, administration officials would testify in a Maryland court that Abrego Garcia’s return was out of their hands and up to the government of El Salvador.Xinis has accused the Trump administration of stonewalling information and is allowing for discovery in the civil case to continue to determine if the Trump administration violated her court order to return Abrego Garcia.",,,,2025-06-26 13:09:05.868068

But Thursday, plans appeared to have shifted to deportation somewhere else.DOJ attorney Jonathan Guynn, under questioning by District of Maryland Judge Paula Xinis, said the Trump administration planned to deport Abrego Garcia, and “to a third country is my understanding.”“He will be taken into (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) custody and removal proceedings will be initiated,” Guynn said of Abrego Garcia’s release. “There are no imminent plans to remove him to a third country.""Xinis declined the request to return him to Maryland, arguing that Abrego Garcia has not been released and that she’s not clear if she has the jurisdiction to fulfill such a request.She added that Guynn said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security does not have “imminent plans” to deport Abrego Garcia to a third country, while holding out that possibility.The Supreme Court this week, ruled that it will allow, for now, the Trump administration to continue carrying out deportations to third countries, after a Massachusetts judge barred removals without proper notice. In such cases, immigrants are deported to countries that are not their native countries and may be far from them.Jonathan Cooper, a partner of Quinn Emmanuel, the firm representing Abrego Garcia in his immigration case, tried to ask Xinis if she would require the Trump administration to notify Cooper and his team before deporting him to a third country.“We have concerns that the government may try to move Mr. Abrego Garcia quickly over the weekend,” Cooper said.Xinis said she would not because Guynn said that the Trump administration had no “imminent plans” to remove Abrego Garcia.Cooper laid out the same concerns in the written emergency request to Xinis Thursday.“The Government’s public statements leave little doubt about its plan: remove Abrego Garcia to El Salvador once more,” according to the complaint written by attorneys from Quinn Emmanuel.“If this Court does not act swiftly, then the Government is likely to whisk Abrego Garcia away to some place far from Maryland,” it says.Federal prosecutors in Tennessee court have said that should Abrego Garcia be released, he would be immediately arrested by ICE agents and could face deportation back to El Salvador, despite having protections from such removal since 2019.Tennessee caseAbrego Garcia was returned from El Salvador earlier this month to the United States to face federal criminal charges lodged in Tennessee that accuse him “of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”The indictment occurred while Abrego Garcia was housed in a Salvadoran prison.The human smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee when police pulled Abrego Garcia over for speeding. Eight other men were in the car, but neither Abrego Garcia nor the passengers were arrested.DHS opened an investigation into the three-year-old stop and Attorney General Pam Bondi held a press conference on the day Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face federal charges.She argued that the traffic stop was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme where Abrego Garcia was paid by members of the MS-13 gang to transport migrants who entered the country without legal authorization to destinations across the country.His attorneys have denied the charges and Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty in federal court in Nashville.Stephen Miller, the chief architect of many of the president’s immigration policies and a senior White House adviser, has written on social media that Abrego Garcia would be deported back to El Salvador if released. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have pointed to that statement as to why they want him brought back to Maryland.The Trump administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a leader of the MS-13 gang, and President Donald Trump has made those same allegations. During an interview, the president held up a photo of Abrego Garcia’s knuckles that were digitally altered to type MS-13 on his fingers.House Democrats pressed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in May about the doctored photo and she sidestepped questions about whether the photo was real, until she eventually said she was unaware it existed.She added that even if Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. that he would be immediately deported.Maryland argumentsIn Maryland, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said in their complaint they want to ensure he is not deported again.“This motion does not ask this Court to adjudicate Abrego Garcia’s custodial status in the Tennessee criminal proceedings; that is for the Tennessee district court to resolve,” they wrote.“Nor does this motion seek to alter any of the conditions of release set by the Tennessee district court or otherwise interfere with the Tennessee criminal proceedings.

(Photo: NCGA)Governor Josh Stein’s key cabinet members have been on the job since January but required confirmation from the state Senate under a 2016 law to check the governor’s appointment powers. And after months of multiple committee hearings, the state Senate on Thursday gave its blessing to Stein’s final three cabinet secretaries for the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Adult Correction, and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
Reid Wilson, who has spent the last four years leading the NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, now has the full title of Secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality.
The confirmation hearing for Wilson encountered a brief hiccup Wednesday from an angry constituent. Nelson Paul of Beaufort said the Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) recently contacted his wife and other recreational fishing license holders to encourage them to support a ban on inland shrimp trawling.
“This is a blatant political act to put the thumb on the scale to ensure shrimp trawling ban come into effect. I want to know what Mr. Wilson is doing about this? We need to know who’s responsible and what is being done to discipline that employee,” said Paul.
  In a battle to ban inland shrimp trawling, Nelson Paul of Beaufort objected to Wilson’s appointment as DEQ Secretary. (Photo: NCGA)
But the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) is a separate state agency, distinct from NCWRC.
“Are you commenting on the nominee or are you pontificating on your stand on a particular issue?” interjected Sen. Bill Rabon.
“I have difficulty hiring blatantly environmentally proponent…people who have no business experience, just somebody who is an environmental advocate who just has no understanding of the business in the state,” Paul responded.
Rabon thanked Paul for his remarks but noted everybody on the Select Committee on Nominations was comfortable moving forward with Wilson.
For his part, Wilson has pledged to help Western North Carolina communities recover and rebuild from Hurricane Helene.
“Whether it is water infrastructure or waste cleanup or dam inspections or debris cleanup, we’re involved in many, many ways and we’re going to be at it until the job is done,” Wilson testified.
Wilson said his second top priority is trying to reduce PFAS pollution, also known as “forever chemicals” in the state’s waterways.
About a third of the people in North Carolina drink water with PFAS levels above what will be the EPA’s health standard, according to Wilson.

Leslie Dismukes told lawmakers it has been an honor to serve the past six months as the interim Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction (DAC).
Previously working as the Criminal Bureau Chief at the North Carolina Department of Justice, Dismukes wore many hats, including supervising the legal work of NCDAC.

During her confirmation hearing in May, Dismukes said that the state was faced with a 40% vacancy rate for correctional officers.
This week, she indicated the department was making some headway.
“We’ve streamlined our HR processes, added additional resources to HR in recruitment, and expanded our basic training offerings to decrease the time from offer to post. This has resulted in 250 people in basic training right now and a 1% decrease in our vacancy rates since January,” said Dismukes.
In addition to recruitment, the DAC Secretary reminded legislators that the fire suppression systems at nearly two dozen prisons remain outdated or completely inoperable.
“I’ve raised the alarm, no pun intended, regarding the 23 prisons we currently have on fire watch and the more than $90 million that it will take to avoid grave disaster,” Dismukes warned.
Dismukes said she’s also empowered a new chief medical officer to move forward with critical process improvements to streamline services that achieve cost savings while maintaining the standard of care.
This fiscal year, the department is projected to spend $425 million on health care.
Dismukes’ reality check comes as the North Carolina House and Senate have been unable to agree to a comprehensive budget plan with the fiscal year that starts July 1.

Also winning Senate confirmation Thursday was Jocelyn Mallette as Secretary of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
Mallette served on active duty for ten years in the United States Air Force, as an admissions advisor at the Academy, an intelligence officer, and finally as a prosecutor in the Judge Advocate General’s (JAG) Corps.

Mallette pledged in her new role to make the transition from military life into the civilian workforce as smoother one.
“DMVA should be leading the way to retain North Carolina’s transitioning service members and families, and also to attract those who get out of the military and other states,” said Mallette. “All of us on the federal, state, and local level need to work together to support them during the year that is referred to as “the deadly gap.”
The period during which a servicemember transitions out of active duty to civilian life can present many major life challenges. It’s also a period in which the veteran suicide rate is 2.5 times higher than the rate for active-duty military.
Mallette said North Carolina DMVA is actively partnering with entities like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Labor, the North Carolina Department of Commerce, and nonprofits like Blue Star Families and Veterans Bridge Home to establish initiatives that more quickly connect transitioning service members to benefits, jobs, and housing upon the end of their service.

(Getty Images)The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported Thursday two more measles diagnoses in the state, bringing the total case count to five.
One of the cases was detected in Utah County, while the other is from the southwest health district, which serves Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, the department said in a news release. One of the new diagnosed patients is a minor and the other, an adult.
Like the previous three confirmed cases, the patients were unvaccinated. But, these additional patients were linked to previously diagnosed individuals rather than community exposure. Public health officials are conducting investigations to determine whether there are any additional cases in the state as national outbreaks keep on increasing.

Two of the five cases are unvaccinated, pregnant Utahns. According to the department, individuals infected with measles during pregnancy are at high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or giving birth to a child who will experience serious medical problems. Pregnant women are also “much more likely to be hospitalized because of severe measles.”
Utah health officials report two more measles cases

“The department recommends that if you are planning to become pregnant, get vaccinated before you get pregnant to protect yourself and your baby,” DHHS officials wrote in the release. “You can’t get the MMR vaccine while you are pregnant. If you get the MMR vaccine, wait at least 4 weeks after you get your shot before you try to get pregnant.”
As of Thursday morning, two of the Utah patients had been hospitalized due to complications from the virus but have since been released. 
Measles early symptoms show up seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever higher than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough, runny nose or red eyes. A rash could appear four days after the fever starts. Health officials recommend that people experiencing these symptoms stay away from others and call health care providers before making a visit to avoid spreading the virus. 
“The most effective prevention against the measles is vaccination. Public health officials in Utah want to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation,” according to the release. ” The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective against measles when the person gets 2 doses.”

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025NASHVILLE — A Maryland man facing criminal charges in Tennessee, after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, will remain in jail until at least Friday as a federal judge weighs whether prosecutors have the power to keep him from being “precipitously deported.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, appeared Wednesday in a downtown Nashville courtroom for a hearing to set the conditions of his release while a criminal case against him moves forward.
Abrego was indicted by a Tennessee grand jury June 6 on two criminal human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment occurred while Abrego was housed in a Salvadoran prison, where U.S. immigration officials dispatched him after a routine traffic stop.
A Department of Justice attorney later conceded Abrego’s deportation had been a mistake. His case has come to symbolize the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
Wearing an orange jumpsuit and seated next to his attorneys, Abrego occasionally glanced in the direction of the gallery where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, sat in the first row. It was the couple’s wedding anniversary, she told reporters earlier in the day.

But as Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes went over the terms of Abregos’s pretrial release, defense attorneys raised the specter that he could instead face deportation.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are expected to take Abrego into custody immediately once he is released by the federal court.
Sean Hecker, an attorney for Abrego, sought a decision by the judge that Abrego’s release would be conditional on prosecutors working to ensure that he would not be deported while the case remains ongoing.
Hecker also sought assurances that Abrego would not be housed in Texas, Louisiana or other parts of the country that could impede access to his attorneys.
In support of his request, Hecker noted prosecutors and the Department of Homeland Security had a history of coordination and cooperation in Abrego’s case.
DHS and federal prosecutors coordinated to bring charges against Abrego, including facilitating his return from El Salvador to face an indictment in Tennessee; they also established agreements with potential witnesses against Abrego to halt their own deportation cases, Hecker said.
But acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire indicated he could make no promises about either Abrego’s placement in an ICE facility accessible to his attorneys or to prevent his deportation. He told the court that he would “do his best.”
“I will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, but obviously I can’t tell them what to do,” he said. McGuire noted that ICE — a department within the federal homeland security agency — is not a party to the case.
McGuire had unsuccessfully sought to keep Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who typically oversee detainees awaiting trial on federal crimes.
In an order issued over the weekend, Holmes denied the prosecutors’ petition, ruling that Abrego had a right to release while awaiting trial.
“These are the sort of practical implications of that (the judge’s decision),” McGuire said Wednesday.
Holmes has given attorneys until noon Friday to submit legal arguments that address the question of “what can the government do to ensure Mr. Abrego will not be precipitously deported.”
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing an appeal of Holmes’ weekend decision to release Abrego.
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., separately on Wednesday, set a July 16 hearing day to review prosecutors’ request to revoke Abrego’s release from the custody of U.S. Marshals.
The criminal charges Abrego faces stem from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop alleged the trip was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme in which Abrego was a paid driver who transported migrants who illegally crossed the southern border to destinations across the country.

(Photo by Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will reexamine current recommendations around childhood vaccination schedules and Hepatitis B immunizations, members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices announced during a meeting in Atlanta Wednesday.
The committee, which meets three times a year, does not typically garner much public interest. However, this meeting is the first since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics, launching the little-known committee into the national spotlight.
Medical experts, including the American Medical Association, expressed dismay at Kennedy’s appointment of the new committee members, which the organization said occurred “without transparency and proper vetting to ensure they have the expertise necessary to make vaccine recommendations to protect the health of Americans.”
“We urge the administration to reconsider the removal of the 17 ACIP members who have deep expertise in vaccines so physicians can continue to have confidence in ACIP’s recommendations,” AMA President Bobby M. Mukkamala said in a statement.
Six former ACIP leaders also authored an op-ed after the former committee members’ dismissal, warning that “if relevant scientific expertise on vaccines is not maintained, access to vaccines may fundamentally change.”
The move was also made in direct contradiction with a promise from Kennedy to Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy ahead of the secretary’s confirmation in February. Cassidy says Kennedy pledged to “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.”
Cassidy, a doctor who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary, called for the meeting to be delayed until members with more expertise in vaccines could be appointed to the panel, but was unsuccessful. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski also expressed concern about the backgrounds of the new panelists.
The committee is now led by Martin Kulldorff, a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who was fired in 2024 after declining the COVID-19 vaccine, and has spoken out against blanket vaccine mandates during the pandemic.
“Secretary Kennedy has given this committee a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine when making vaccine recommendations, and that is what we will do,” Kulldorff said in his opening remarks. He also disputed characterizations of his skepticism of vaccine mandates as “anti-vax.”
“Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee, issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro- or anti-vaccine box,” he said. “Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry, and it further feeds the flame of vaccine hesitancy. To thoroughly scrutinize and assure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.”
Other appointees to the committee include Robert Malone, a doctor and biochemist who said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise” and Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses who also serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization that advocates for vaccine exemptions.
One member of the committee, Michael Ross, had already withdrawn from the committee by the time the body convened for the two-day summit in Atlanta. Kennedy, who was attending a “Make America Healthy Again” event in Oklahoma, was not present at the meeting.
  ‘Completely unprecedented’ 

As the committee met inside, dozens of people braved the sweltering heat to hold what they called a “parade of preventable diseases” to highlight the dangers of limiting the public’s access to vaccines. They also called for the committee to be restored to its previous makeup.
A whole colorful cast of pathogens were represented just outside the center’s entrance, from influenza to HPV to meningococcus. Dr. Deblina Datta carried a leg brace to represent polio.
“This is what we don’t want to see again. When we introduce vaccine skepticism, we are going to see people wearing this,” Datta said holding up the brace.
Datta spent more than two decades at CDC working on immunizations, with six years with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. She called the abrupt overhaul of the committee alarming.
“While a healthy skepticism of vaccine policy is good, this level of skepticism and the sources of the skeptics being put onto ACIP is calamitous,” Datta said. “And it’s absolutely eroding the public’s faith in the ACIP to dictate policy.”
Katrina Kretsinger, who retired from the CDC two years ago after working mostly on vaccine-preventable diseases, said she has major concerns about the changes made to the committee.
“This is completely unprecedented,” she said. “And I really don’t think it’s going to have any credibility.”
But she said she is also trying to have “a little bit of wait and see” attitude about the new members.
“I would say that there’s a number of them who seem like they are reasonably well qualified, and then there are others of the seven who come with a very clear anti-vaccine agenda and are well known for viewpoints that are really hard to defend based on the scientific merits,” Kretsinger said. “It’s very disappointing.”
  ACIP’s new agenda 

The new ACIP appointees are scheduled to spend two days reviewing safety and efficacy data on COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella (MMRV), Influenza, Anthrax and Chikungunya vaccines before voting on new immunization recommendations.
However, Kulldorff said the committee also plans to commission new working groups dedicated to evaluating the impact of childhood vaccines and investigating the timeline for the recommended administration of Hepatitis B vaccines in newborns. The committee will also be reexamining vaccines that have not been reviewed within the last seven years.
“In addition to studying and evaluating individual vaccines, it’s important to evaluate the cumulative effect of the recommended vaccine schedule,” Kulldorff said.
Thursday’s agenda also includes a presentation from Lyn Redwood, the former head of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy.
Redwood, who is not a CDC employee, is expected to argue that a preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, known as thimerosal, causes autism. According to the CDC, research has shown no connection between thimerosal and autism or any other source of harm, and the chemical was taken out of childhood vaccines in the U.S. in 2001.

Medicaid patients do not have the right to sue to visit the doctor of their choice, allowing states like South Carolina to remove clinics that also provide abortions from their lists of providers, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to Thursday’s opinion began with a 2018 executive order, in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of medical providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.
Six justices agreed with the decision. One wrote a separate concurring opinion. Three dissented.

Planned Parenthood, which operates two clinics in the state, sued, claiming a patient has the right to visit the clinics for other services, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Medicaid already excludes most abortions, covering them only in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life under a federal provision South Carolina follows.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
A federal appeals court ruled against McMaster’s order three times, deciding the state can’t deny Medicaid patients from going to the provider of their choice because the provider also offers abortions.
Each time, the state’s attorneys appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the issue until December.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)In the shadow of Three Mile Island’s iconic cooling towers, state Rep. Tom Mehaffie recalled Wednesday how his father, 50 years earlier, built a career and a life around the nuclear power plant.
“When Constellation left and this plant shut down, a lot was missed,” Mehaffie said, noting the fortunes of businesses and the community followed that of the plant in Dauphin County.
Now, state government and energy and tech industry leaders are betting on its rebirth as an example of Pennsylvania’s readiness to power future industries, including electricity-intensive artificial intelligence data centers.
In a $16 billion deal between owner Constellation Energy and Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers, Three Mile Island is set to return to service as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Let’s not just open this plant, let’s open business,” Mehaffie told a tent full of Constellation Energy workers gathered to celebrate progress in the plant’s restoration, including an expedited review that cuts about a year off the project’s timeline.

About 10 miles south of Harrisburg near Middletown, Three Mile Island was the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that transfixed the world. But after that partial meltdown in one of the plant’s two reactors, the remaining Unit 1 continued safely producing electricity for another 40 years.

In 2019, Constellation determined the facility was no longer economically viable and put plans in motion to permanently decommission the reactor. With peak energy demand, driven largely by data centers, predicted to grow up to 17% by 2035, the plant’s capacity is now in high demand.
“We made a mistake in shutting down this plant, but we’re not here to dwell on that mistake,” Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said, noting that hiring staff for the recommissioning process is ahead of schedule because many former workers returned.
The plant’s reopening will support at least 650 permanent jobs and hundreds more for building-trade workers during the recommissioning process.
Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomed the returning workers Wednesday, as he highlighted the role of nuclear power in his energy plan.
“We’re going to make sure you never have to leave again,” Shapiro said. “This is going to be one of those places where the jobs get passed down from generation to generation, where fathers talk to their daughters about the work that they did, and their daughters pick up that mantle of energy leadership right here at Crane.”
Shapiro has outlined a plan over the last two years to ensure the commonwealth remains a leader in the competitive energy market, by leveraging the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Shapiro noted his administration intervened to ensure the Crane center would be able to quickly reconnect to the regional power grid that serves Pennsylvania and all or parts of 12 other states.
PJM Interconnect, which operates the grid and ensures adequate energy supplies, has a backlog of projects waiting to be approved for connection. The company created its Reliable Resource Initiative last year to expedite the interconnection of 51 shovel-ready generating resources that include battery storage, nuclear and natural gas facilities, a PJM spokesperson said.
Shapiro, who describes himself as an “all of the above energy governor,” noted the state has four operating nuclear power plants that provide nearly one-third of its energy.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Shapiro said. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said the Crane center is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring nuclear energy online with the speed needed to match the growth of artificial intelligence.
“It’s a unique opportunity where we can bring together a supportive community, state and a skilled workforce that is absolutely the best kept secret ingredient,” Hollis said.
Microsoft’s agreement to purchase all of the Crane center’s 835-megawatt output demonstrates the importance of abundant energy for tech industry growth, Shapiro said.
“That is a heck of a signal of the optimism people feel about Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting that Amazon also recently announced a $20 billion investment in a data complex near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County.
PJM interconnection president and CEO Manu Asthana said as the state swelters through its first heatwave of the summer, the growth in demand for energy is apparent. PJM this week recorded an all-time peak in electricity production, nine gigawatts larger than last summer’s peak. Asthana said the difference is equal to 11 times the Crane center’s planned output.
“What we’re talking about here is not hypothetical. Our country needs this power. All of our citizens need this power just to keep their lights on, to stay warm, to stay cool,” he said, adding that ensuring power for all that plus AI is a matter of national security.
“I can’t imagine by 2030 what artificial intelligence will enable us to do and strategically, for our country, for our state, for our region, it is critical that we win that race, and the power that you produce here is critical to winning that race.”

When I came to college, I never expected that my roommate would believe that I infected her with Covid-19, simply because I was Chinese. My negative test didn’t matter. My ethnicity was all she needed to hurl an accusation my way.
When I sought comfort from a Dean, an administrator who claimed to support her students, I never expected that my hurt would be brushed aside. “You could be just as miserable anywhere,” she said. Her final piece of advice? Focus on how to cope.


But, when I joined Asian Students in Action, I found something different: unyielding comfort and validation. My Asian friends didn’t dismiss my pain or tell me to cope. They named the harm. They understood the pain. They knew that the accusation was rooted in the harmful, misguided belief that Asians were carriers of Covid-19—a narrative that surged during the pandemic.
Asian Students in Action provided what the broader institution failed to: community, safety, and the affirmation that what happened to me was not okay. Without that affinity club, I would have felt unseen and unheard. I would have thought that the racism I faced was both unimportant and invisible to the predominantly white college I attended. Without an Asian club, I would have left college after my first year.
Today, critics of DEI initiatives often lump Asian and white Americans together. They do so for three reasons: to dismiss the structural inequities we face, to undermine our solidarity with Black, Latino, and indigenous communities, and to strengthen the very inequalities DEI efforts aim to solve.
On February 14, the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, issued a “Dear Colleague” letter. While this letter claimed to protect students from alleged racial discrimination by educational institutions, its true intent was clear: to dismantle race-based programs altogether.
But, what caught my attention most was this line: “American educational institutions have discriminated against students on the basis of race, including white and Asian students.”
This phrase is troubling. It collapses white and Asian students into one, unified demographic, while Black, Latino, and indigenous students are conspicuously left out. It suggests that white and Asian students endure comparable racial discrimination.
Here’s what I know for certain: my white peers have never been blamed for spreading Covid-19 simply because a president chose to scapegoat their entire ethnicity for the pandemic. I was. Asians were.
When DEI despisers conflate my racial experiences with those of white students, they weaponize the Model Minority Myth to promote a false sense of Asian-White solidarity. The Model Minority Myth frames Asian Americans as the ideal minority—quiet, polite, and compliant—suggesting that if we conform to this stereotype, we’ll be rewarded with proximity to whiteness. A proximity that promises an illusion of immunity from the racial discrimination and systemic inequalities other communities of color face.
Opponents of DEI hope that Asian Americans will endorse their opinion, simply to attain acceptance into the system of white supremacy that dominates the U.S. But, it is naive to think that we would seek acceptance from a system that has long excluded us and fueled an influx of Anti-Asian hate.
As an Asian American, I know what it feels like to be excluded, stereotyped, and overlooked. But I also know the transformative power of belonging, because I’ve experienced it through the community of care that DEI programs make possible. Without DEI, and without the affinity groups it sustains, we will lose some of the only places on campus where students of color feel seen, heard, and safe.
So, when people assume I despise DEI, my answer is clear.
Absolutely not. I am here because of it.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/asian-hate-protest.jpg,,,2025-06-26 12:23:34.281028

June 26, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceFor state Rep. Jason Morgan, an openly gay Democrat from Ann Arbor, the vibrant celebration of love and inclusion that defines Pride Month felt duller this year in the Michigan House of Representatives.
The House has yet to take a vote on or pass a resolution acknowledging Pride Month in June, as it has in the past two years when Democrats controlled all levers of state government. There are no Pride flags flying from the flagpoles on Capitol grounds, nor are any flying from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office in the Romney Building that sits across the street.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Morgan said that the month felt muted in some regard – both at the national scale but also here at home, and in the halls of power where he works each day.
“Now that Republicans are in charge at the federal level and here in the Michigan House, it really feels like there’s a concerted effort to roll back LGBTQ+ rights and protections,” Morgan said. “It feels like there is pressure being applied to businesses and organizations and universities to roll back commonsense efforts to support diversity and LGBTQ+ people.”
Adding to that sense of retrenchment is the fact that the House hasn’t acknowledged Pride Month yet, even as Morgan tried mightily over the last few months to make it happen and in a timely fashion.
Morgan told the Advance that a Pride Month resolution with exclusively Democratic co-sponsors was submitted on Wednesday. The last day of session before Pride Month ends is Thursday, and Morgan hoped that it would come up for a vote then.
A vote on Thursday would also be symbolic, as it marks the 10th anniversary of Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark case that allowed same-sex marriage nationwide.
But House leadership on Thursday said it would not come up for a vote, moving House Democrats to gather on the Capitol steps to read the resolution aloud. Morgan said there that the Supreme Court’s ruling on same-sex marriage was the culmination of decades’ worth of work from community members and allies, resulting in a civil rights victory.
“And yet, 10 years later to the day, Republicans are trying to strip away this progress that so many of us have fought for,” Morgan said. “History teaches us that rights can be won, but they can be taken away just as easily. With constant threats like these against the LGBTQ+ community, Pride is more necessary than ever.”
The process to get a Pride resolution to the floor, however, started in March, with Morgan’s office sending the same resolution that was passed last year to the office of state Rep. John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming), the House’s minority floor leader, which then sent the resolution for edits and approval to the office of House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) in late May.
Morgan said despite some back and forth from the two offices, he and his colleagues – who were pushing to have Pride Month acknowledged by the House earlier in the month than later – never got a clear answer on whether the resolution language was approved, if edits were needed or if it would ever reach the floor.
Morgan on Wednesday said that he at least hoped to get it up on the board for a vote Thursday before the clock winds down.
“All we are asking from the Speaker’s office is to pass the same resolution that passed under Republican and Democratic legislatures before to let our LGBTQ+ Michiganders know that we acknowledge them, welcome them and continue to celebrate living as who they are in our state,” Morgan said.
During a regularly scheduled news briefing on Wednesday with Capitol news reporters, the Advance asked Hall if the House was going to allow a vote on a Pride Month recognition resolution before the month ends.
Hall emphatically said no. When asked if there was a reason, Hall started to move on from the question, but kept coming back to it, adding that he didn’t believe a resolution had actually been introduced.
When he was told by an Advance reporter that Morgan’s office had been working with his office to get it finalized, Hall returned to his initial answer: no, even if it was introduced, it would not be taken up for a vote.
Morgan, following Hall’s news conference, said that at least now he had an answer from the speaker’s office.
Additional issues muting the colors of Pride
State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia), who is openly bisexual, said in an interview that she was not surprised House Republicans stalled the resolution, and that it was to be expected.
“Rep. Morgan has been trying to work in good faith with them, and it’s not really been reciprocated,” she said. “What I can say is that, very clearly, folks who were loud and proud [as allies] back in 2019 don’t seem to have that same level of enthusiasm and support, and that’s disappointing.”
She agreed with Morgan’s assessment that this year in particular feels like the step forward gains of the last six years have taken two steps back.
The House under GOP control this year has passed anti-transgender legislation, including House Bill 4066 and House Bill 4469, aimed at prohibiting transgender girls from joining girls’ interscholastic sports.

While the bills have zero chance of making it past the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate or being signed by Whitmer, Morgan said Democrats would have never put that legislation forward, or even come up for a vote, if they still had control of the House.
There was also House Resolution 28, sponsored in February by arch-conservative state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford), condemning the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to allow same-sex marriage. That remains in the House Government Operations Committee, which is typically where bills and resolutions go to die.
Coupled with Republicans controlling each lever of the federal government, and many of them openly anti-LGBTQ+, the high tide of progress feels a bit like it’s beginning to roll back.
Some members of the community have also noticed that no Pride flags are hanging from state buildings this year. Whitmer hung a Pride flag from her office in the Romney Building in 2019 the year after she was elected to the high office, but has not done so since.

A Whitmer spokesperson said that she has flown the flag outside the governor’s residence in Lansing since 2020, and that it was flying outside her home this week when the Advance inquired about the Romney Building.
The Capitol grounds and what flags fly inside or outside the building is in the purview of the Michigan Capitol Commission and not the governor or legislative leadership.
Messages sent by the Advance requesting an interview with the Capitol Commission or its staff about whether it planned to honor Pride by flying the LGBTQ+ flag were not returned.
The House has a flagpole on the roof of its wing of the chamber, but a Pride flag is unlikely to fly from that pole this week before Pride Month ends.
State Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), an LGBTQ+ ally, said in an interview that “Rainbow Capitalism” was a driving force of why so many corporations and businesses appeared as allies in recent years, with products adorned in Pride colors, but dialed back once the political climate changed.
“Because we have a fascist in the White House and Republicans that are pushing culture wars and not equal rights, corporations have found it easier to back away from their LGBTQ+ stances,” Wegela said. “I think we can’t speak for the community, but as an ally, I think it’s important that corporations adopt standards of human rights at all times, not just when it’s convenient for the profit margins.”
State Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), the first openly gay member of the state Senate, said the fight to have Pride recognized this year in the House harkened back to his fight with former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) over the Senate’s recognition.

Moss told the Advance that Shirkey allowed it to go up for a vote and it passed one year, but then the next year, leadership said they wouldn’t be doing that again.
If House Republicans go the same route, Moss said it would be a sad state of affairs.
“Really, it takes me back to serving in a pre-marriage equality era, and I’m just dismayed about it,” Moss said. “I think we are all fortunate that we still have a very strong, pro-equality majority in the Senate, so any [anti-LGBTQ+ action] they put up in the House is a non-starter in the state Senate. Which is great, but not for the seven of us in our caucus.”
He warned that could be part of the difference for Democrats fighting to take back the House and retain the Senate come election time, as Moss believed that the Shirkey Senate’s anti-LGBTQ+ stance was one factor that helped propel Democrats to the current Senate majority.
As to the change in the atmosphere this June, Moss said the feeling was palpable for LGBTQ+ Michiganders.
“I think the community really gets it, and I think we are prepared to fight like our lives depend on it,” Moss said. “In many cases, they do, as we’ve seen with the recent anti-transgender ruling from the Supreme Court. It’s a new era. It’s a very big reminder that the progress that was made is very fragile.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Four Republican lawmakers want oversight of a Kansas Native American university to shift from the federal government to a board of regents under proposed legislation.
It’s a move that follows cuts to the Haskell Indian Nations University’s programming from Trump administration policies, years of congressional inquiries into staff misconduct and months of weighing input from tribes and the university, lawmakers said.
The university, located in Lawrence, is under the purview of the Bureau of Indian Education within the U.S. Department of the Interior. U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas, along with Kansas U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann and Derek Schmidt and Oklahoma U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, say a change is needed. Some tribal and Indian education leaders agree, arguing a shift to a board of regents would empower tribal communities.
“The bureau has failed to protect students, respond to my congressional inquiries or meet the basic infrastructure needs of the university,” Moran said in a news release. “It is clear that the best path forward is for the university to be led by an independent Board of Regents nominated by the Tribal community and no longer obstructed by the BIE.”
Moran and Mann introduced companion bills Monday in the House and Senate. The Senate bill was referred to a finance committee, and the House resolution was sent to three separate committees for review. However, the process began six months ago, when Moran and Mann announced their intentions to draft legislation to charter the university and transfer governance to the Haskell Board of Regents, while maintaining federal funding for the school.
The board currently has 15 members. Thirteen are appointed through tribal or intertribal resolutions, making certain to represent the broader Alaska Native and American Indian communities. The remaining two members are designated by the university’s student body government and alumni association.
Dalton Henry, president of the board of regents, said the university has succeeded in advancing Native students and strengthening tribal nations for decades.
“Yet, persistent challenges under federal oversight have limited its potential,” Henry said.
Shifting oversight to a Native-led board of trustees cements the notion that tribal nations are the most qualified candidates to shape the university’s future, he said.
“This is how we secure Haskell’s legacy,” Henry said, “not just for today’s students, but for the next seven generations.”
The four-year university enrolled about 900 students from nearly 150 federally recognized tribes in 2024. In 2023, a federal report that wasn’t made public until more than a year later revealed the university failed to implement adequate sexual assault policies, that it wrongfully terminated some staff and employees, and that university leadership intimidated students.
Under the proposed legislation, the university’s headquarters will remain in Lawrence with the option to establish branches elsewhere. The president of the university would serve as CEO of the university and would be appointed by the board of regents. If passed, the legislation would establish a trust fund for the university and require stringent, annual reporting to Congress.
Moriah O’Brien, vice president of the Congressional and Federal Relations of American Indian Higher Education Consortium, said the legislation reaffirms the federal government’s treaty responsibility for higher education and the importance of culturally relevant education to the survival of tribal nations. O’Brien said the legislation also “rightfully empowers” the board of regents with decision-making authority while it currently serves on an advisory basis.
The bill, called the Haskell Indian Nations University Improvement Act, also earned the support of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians tribal chief, the National Congress of American Indians, the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Education Association and the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Chief Cyrus Ben said the change will offer the university “the stability, autonomy and leadership it needs to thrive.”
“Haskell holds a special place in the hearts of many of our Tribal students — past, present, and future — who attend with deep pride and commitment,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Bureau of Indian Education said in an emailed statement that the bureau does not comment on proposed legislation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Hiawathahall-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 12:23:34.281028

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court issued two orders Wednesday, declining to hear cases challenging the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps. 
Democrats had hoped that the liberal wing of the court retaining majority control of the body in this spring’s election would give them an opportunity to change the congressional lines. Republicans currently hold six of the state’s eight congressional seats, and Democrats hoped they could flip the 1st and 3rd CDs under friendlier maps. 
Before Republicans drew new congressional lines in 2010, Democrats controlled five of the state’s seats. The current maps were drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and approved by the state Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservatives. That Court had required that any proposed maps adhere to a “least change” standard that changed as little as possible from the 2010 maps. 
While Evers’ maps made the two competitive districts slightly closer contests, they’re still controlled by Republican U.S. Reps. Bryan Steil and Derrick Van Orden. 
The two lawsuits were brought by the Elias Law Group representing Democratic candidates and voters and the Campaign Legal Center on behalf of a group of voters. The cases argued the maps violated the state’s constitutional requirement that all voters be treated equally. 
The challenges against the maps drew national attention as Democrats hope to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections. 
This is the second time in as many years that the Supreme Court, under a liberal majority, has declined to hear challenges to the congressional maps. 
In both cases, the Court issued unanimous decisions without any explanation as to why they weren’t accepting the cases. 
Aside from declining to hear the cases, Justice Janet Protasiewicz issued an order denying requests that she recuse herself from the case. Republicans have called for her recusal from redistricting cases because of comments she made during her 2023 campaign about Wisconsin’s need for fairer maps. Previously, after Protasiewicz joined the Court, as part of a new liberal majority, it declared the state’s legislative maps, which locked in disproportionate Republican majorities in the Legislature, unconstitutional. 
“I am confident that I can, in fact and appearance, act in an impartial manner in this case,” she wrote. “And the Due Process Clause does not require my recusal because neither my campaign statements nor contributions to my campaign create a ‘serious risk of actual bias.’”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 15:31:24+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven to build $316M transit-oriented development project at Union Station,Mona Mahadevan | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/new-haven-union-station-development/,"Two towers containing 470 apartments and 28,000 square feet of retail and commercial space are now slated to be built next to Union Station.","Two 16-story towers containing 470 apartments and 28,000 square feet of retail and commercial space are now slated to be built next to New Haven’s Union Station, per the governor’s announcement Wednesday of a major new transit-oriented development.
Gov. Ned Lamont and state Department of Transportation Deputy Commissioner Laoise King broke that news in an email press release. 
The governor, Mayor Justin Elicker, and top city and state officials gathered at that same time in the parking lot just north of Union Station to hold a press conference about the project. 
According to the governor’s press release, the $316.1 million project will be led by Gilbane Development Company and MURAL Real Estate Partners. 
The press release states that, of the 470 new apartments, 118 will be ​“affordable units.” 
At Wednesday’s presser, Elicker said that 20 percent of the new apartments will be reserved for households making no more than 50 percent of the area median income (AMI), which currently is around $45,500 for a two-person household. Elicker said an additional 5 percent of the new apartments will be reserved for those earning up to 80 percent AMI, which currently translates to $72,800 for a family of two.
In addition to the 28,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, there will also be 26,000 square feet of residential amenities and 294 parking spaces to serve tenants and transit customers.
Construction will unfold in two phases. The first, scheduled to begin in late 2026 and finish in early 2028, will include 280 units and 393,000 square feet of development. The second phase is slated to begin in August 2029 and wrap up by November 2031, delivering the remaining 190 units and 286,000 square feet.
Opening Wednesday’s press conference, Elicker described Union Station as ​“the welcoming mat to the city” and framed the project as part of a broader initiative to increase the city’s housing supply. This will help ​“make sure we build, build, build,” he said, noting that 7,000 apartments are currently in the pipeline citywide.
King viewed the idea of building more as ​“really exciting,” though emphasized that what constitutes appropriate housing depends on a community’s size and character. Nonetheless, she said, ​“There is so much land that can be put to higher and better uses.”
Gilbane CEO Edward Broderick highlighted the development’s mixed-use, mixed-income vision. His company is committed to providing ​“quality housing that serves a wide range of incomes,” he said. ​“One day, the short walk from here and the Green will be filled with spaces where families are happy to go; where they can get a cup of coffee or lunch.”
MURAL CEO Robin Ziegler echoed that vision for a vibrant neighborhood, saying the development aims to attract ​“young professionals, families, singles, and empty nesters” alike. She said the commercial portion would likely include both food and retail, selected in coordination with the city using ​“a community-driven and community-centered approach” to ensure they ​“provide something for everyone.”
New Haven-based firms Pickard Chilton and Newman Architects are among the architects chosen for the project.
For Pickard Chilton Principal Adrienne Nelson, one of the more exciting parts of the project is ​“the opportunity for creating an amazing destination along that walk downtown.” In addition to addressing the housing crisis, she said, ​“it adds to the community in terms of creating a sense of place and arrival.”
On the question of parking — where 294 spaces will be available at the end of construction — King said she ​“think[s] it’s going to be sufficient” for residential and commercial uses. Commuters, she added, will be encouraged to use a multi-modal transit center planned for the station’s West Lot, which is currently in the design phase.
Newman Architects Principal Melinda Agron agreed. Based on data collected by her firm, many parking garages in New Haven are underutilized, demonstrating the city’s reduced demand for parking, as well as providing another parking option for the building’s future residents. ​“It takes a cultural shift to get used to the idea that we don’t need as much parking,” she said.
City spokesperson Lenny Speiller told the Independent that this newly announced development project will not impact the existing Union Station Parking Garage, which has 876 parking spaces. He also noted that the state Department of Transportation is planning to build an additional parking garage on the West Lot. That new garage will have 400 to 600 new parking spaces.
Wednesday’s announcement comes nearly four years after the city, state, and parking authority struck an agreement in 2021 to build up the lot just north of Union Station into a new mixed-use development. By late 2024, four developers had responded to a request for qualification for the project: Gilbane, Spinnaker, Richman Group, and Twining Properties.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/slack-imgs-1024x538.jpg,,,2025-06-26 12:23:34.281028

The South Carolina case that led to Thursday’s opinion began with a 2018 executive order, in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of medical providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.
Six justices agreed with the decision. One wrote a separate concurring opinion. Three dissented.
Planned Parenthood, which operates two clinics in the state, sued, claiming a patient has the right to visit the clinics for other services, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Medicaid already excludes most abortions, covering them only in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life under a federal provision South Carolina follows.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
A federal appeals court ruled against McMaster’s order three times, deciding the state can’t deny Medicaid patients from going to the provider of their choice because the provider also offers abortions.
Each time, the state’s attorneys appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the issue until December.

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A Maryland man facing criminal charges in Tennessee, after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, will remain in jail until at least Friday as a federal judge weighs whether prosecutors have the power to keep him from being “precipitously deported.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, appeared Wednesday in a downtown Nashville courtroom for a hearing to set the conditions of his release while a criminal case against him moves forward.
Abrego Garcia was indicted by a Tennessee grand jury June 6 on two criminal human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment occurred while Abrego Garcia was housed in a Salvadoran prison, where U.S. immigration officials dispatched him after a routine traffic stop.
A Department of Justice attorney later conceded Abrego Garcia’s deportation had been a mistake. His case has come to symbolize the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
Wearing an orange jumpsuit and seated next to his attorneys, Abrego Garcia occasionally glanced in the direction of the gallery where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, sat in the first row. It was the couple’s wedding anniversary, she told reporters earlier in the day.
But as Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes went over the terms of Abrego Garcia’s pretrial release, defense attorneys raised the specter that he could instead face deportation.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are expected to take Abrego Garcia into custody immediately once he is released by the federal court.
Sean Hecker, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, sought a decision by the judge that Abrego Garcia’s release would be conditional on prosecutors working to ensure that he would not be deported while the case remains ongoing.
Hecker also sought assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be housed in Texas, Louisiana or other parts of the country that could impede access to his attorneys.
In support of his request, Hecker noted prosecutors and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had a history of coordination and cooperation in Abrego Garcia’s case.
DHS and federal prosecutors coordinated to bring charges against Abrego Garcia, including facilitating his return from El Salvador to face an indictment in Tennessee; they also established agreements with potential witnesses against Abrego Garcia to halt their own deportation cases, Hecker said.
But acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire indicated he could make no promises about either Abrego Garcia’s placement in an ICE facility accessible to his attorneys or to prevent his deportation. He told the court that he would “do his best.”

“I will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, but obviously I can’t tell them what to do,” he said. McGuire noted that ICE — a department within the federal homeland security agency — is not a party to the case.
McGuire had unsuccessfully sought to keep Abrego Garcia in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who typically oversee detainees awaiting trial on federal crimes.
In an order issued over the weekend, Holmes denied the prosecutors’ petition, ruling that Abrego Garcia had a right to release while awaiting trial.
“These are the sort of practical implications of that (the judge’s decision),” McGuire said Wednesday.
Holmes has given attorneys until noon Friday to submit legal arguments that address the question of “what can the government do to ensure Mr. Abrego will not be precipitously deported.”
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing an appeal of Holmes’ weekend decision to release Abrego Garcia.
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., separately on Wednesday, set a July 16 hearing day to review prosecutors’ request to revoke Abrego Garcia’s release from the custody of U.S. Marshals.
The criminal charges Abrego Garcia faces stem from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop alleged the trip was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme in which Abrego Garcia was a paid driver who transported migrants who illegally crossed the southern border to destinations across the country.

Generally, new mayors and governing boards possess the power to void and renegotiate contractual decisions made by their predecessors. But this rule does not apply to contracts that are time-specified by statute, such as the six-year solid waste collection contract penned by the city last year.
Since the Jackson city council agreed to a $64-million contract with the New Orleans-based, minority-owned Richard’s Disposal in 2024, the city’s garbage contract likely won’t be reopened until at least 2030, after Horhn’s first term ends. 
But the new mayor is expected to take a host of other contracts under review when he takes office on July 1. 
Robert Gibbs, the chair of Horhn’s transition team, said they have obtained lists of hundreds of city contracts and grants to review with an eye toward efficiency and effectiveness but that it’s too early to say which ones could be renegotiated. 
“For instance, when there has been a man shortage problem, (the city of Jackson has) been able to enter into contracts with companies that brought the man power and the know-how,” Gibbs said this week on Mississippi Today’s political podcast The Other Side. “As we’ve looked at those, some of those are working very well, and we may very well continue those. But in other instances, there’s been a loss of employees for whatever reasons, and those departments have to be built back up.” 
Gibbs added the transition team has heard complaints from local contractors who feel the city has been unreceptive to doing business with them. 
An attorney, developer and local contractor himself, Gibbs was involved in the yearslong dispute between outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the city council over selecting a new garbage vendor, which spanned from 2021 to 2024. Gibbs’ company served as the minority subcontractor for Waste Management, the company that formerly held the contract and was vying for a renewal. 
“You always hear about the dollar circulating in the community seven, eight times, and that’s important for your community to be profitable. But if those dollars go and leave your community, then you lose that seven or eight times effect,” Gibbs said. “And that’s what I’m afraid we’ve done with a couple of contracts in the city of Jackson.”
The pledge to review contracts has been welcomed by some city council members, including Ashby Foote, a representative for Ward 1 who has vocally opposed numerous city agreements in recent years, including the garbage contract. 
“So much of this stuff has been outsourced because we haven’t had the personnel to do stuff that should’ve been done internally,” Foote said. 
In particular, Foote noted that last year he voted with a majority of the city council to pay $700,000 to a local engineering firm for what he described as a one-year “contract to review contracts” in the public works department.
While Horhn will likely have the opportunity to renegotiate that contract early in his first term, he won’t be able to touch the garbage collection agreement without some effort. 
In general, new mayors and governing boards in Mississippi have the power to rescind or modify city agreements, because that is what they’ve been elected to do, said Pieter Teeuwissen, a Hinds County Court Judge. 
But that rule does not apply to certain time-limited obligations that governments can enter, such as the issuing of municipal bonds, the leasing of sixteenth section lands or the collection of solid waste. 
“The general rule is you want to give each successor governing authority as much opportunity as possible to have a say in the business of the city or county,” Teeuwissen said. “But the legislature in its infinite wisdom has decided that certain types of contracts ought to carry a specific time. Someone who is buying $40 or $50 million in government debt doesn’t want to have to worry every four years that they’re gonna get canceled.” 
The rules around time-limited contracts were the subject of a lawsuit that Teeuwissen brought against Hinds County for terminating his contract as board attorney before its one-year period expired. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with him.
In the case of solid waste collection, state statute permits municipalities to sign six-year contracts, with options to extend the contract through four additional one-year periods. 
This could be because garbage collection is considered an essential city service, Teeuwissen theorized, but he noted that almost any contract can be renegotiated if one party is intent on it, even as these laws are poorly understood by many attorneys in Mississippi.
“A good lawyer and a good set of facts can get you out of almost anything,” he said. 
Marcus Wallace, a well-known city subcontractor, ran for mayor in the Democratic primary in part because he was unhappy with Lumumba’s approach to contracting. He said he’s hopeful the incoming administration will prioritize local contractors who can keep the city’s money in Jackson.  
“Let the big companies pave your State Streets and your Northside Drives and Woodrow Wilsons, but when you go into these neighborhoods and these smaller streets – like a Valley Street – allow the smaller companies to do those jobs,” he said.

She outlined her accomplishments and goals in an interview.,"Indiana Comptroller Elise Nieshalla, a Republican, poses after an interview in downtown Indianapolis on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After serving out the rest of another’s term in office, Indiana Comptroller Elise Nieshalla is seeking her own.
“I knew from the beginning that that would be what I would do: fulfill the term and then be ready to run,” she told the Capital Chronicle on Wednesday.
Nieshalla, a Republican, has served as the state’s 58th chief financial officer since late 2023. Former Gov. Eric Holcomb appointed her after predecessor Tera Klutz resigned.
“It is an absolute privilege to serve as state comptroller in a great state like Indiana, that has its fiscal house in order,” Nieshalla said. “And it would be a privilege to continue serving, to do our part in our office: to provide the accounting and the reporting, the distribution of the tax revenues to the local units, the payroll, the payment of the state’s bills.”
Achievements made — and envisioned
Nieshalla said she’s proudest of her efforts to divest from China and entities that follow environmental, social and governance investment principles.
State officials celebrate as public pension system completes Chinese divestment 

The Indiana Public Retirement System finished shedding its $1.2 billion worth of investments in Chinese entities last August — four years ahead of the schedule state lawmakers set and one year after starting the effort.
Nieshalla, as comptroller, is on the system’s board. But she also chairs the board for a pension supplement called the Deferred Compensation Plan, or Hoosier START. That plan wasn’t required to divest — but did.
“We leaned into it as a board and took the spirit of that law and made certain that the funds invested through the Deferred Compensation Plan were also not invested in anything touching Chinese entities,” she said. “And we also accomplished that here, just in this last year. Very proud of that, for the sake of Hoosiers and the beneficiaries that we serve.”
The boards for INPRS and the Deferred Compensation Plan have taken similar actions following another state ban on ESG in pension investments.
Nieshalla has additionally urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate delisting China-based companies on U.S. stock exchanges.
Another achievement she highlighted is coming this fall.
The comptroller’s office is responsible for the Indiana Transparency Portal, and is working on adding visibility into how the state spends federal funds.

Nieshalla also noted that the office has earned a certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada for 31 years straight — and vowed to continue that for another four years if reelected.
She’s got goals for a prospective next term.
Such as: incorporating artificial intelligence into accounts payable, U.S. Department of Government Efficiency-style.
“We can do that here at the state, look through our massive amounts of information and help our people see even more clearly where there are anomalies that need to be investigated,” Nieshalla said.
Another aim is fund number consolidation.
“Currently, the State Board of Accounts has one number for each fund that local units use. The Department of Local Government Finance has another number, and then local units have yet another,” Nieshalla said.
“It is confusing, it is laborious, it is difficult for the sake of transparency, for Hoosiers to understand,” she added, later. “… It is low-hanging fruit for us as a state to consolidate these numbers in partnership with the local units, to streamline that great working relationship that we have in the distribution of funds and to serve them in their budgeting process.”
Extracurricular and past pursuits
When asked if there was anything else she wanted Hoosiers to know about her, Nieshalla offered up her work with the State Financial Officers Foundation. She pitched and now leads a National Debt Crisis Task Force for the conservative organization.
“I’m very concerned about the rapidly dissolving financial position of our country,” Nieshalla said. “We are under the weight of $36 trillion of debt, and the interest payment alone on that debt is the fastest-growing line item in the federal budget.”
Her task force issued a letter late to then-President-elect Donald Trump and the 535 voting members of Congress last year, urging them to take action.

“It made a great impact. And we’re not done,” Nieshalla said. “We’re working on a follow-up letter in partnership with state legislators, and leaning into providing our support to President Trump and Congress to restore the country’s fiscal solvency — for the country and for the states.”
Prior to her appointment as comptroller, Nieshalla was serving as president of the Boone County Council, president of the Indiana County Councils Association and chair of the Association of Indiana Counties’ 2023 Legislative Committee. She has also worked 22 years in real estate.
Nieshalla made an unsuccessful bid for Indiana treasurer at the 2022 GOP convention but lost out to current officeholder Daniel Elliott.
She earned a bachelor’s degree from Oral Roberts University and a master’s degree from Indiana University. She and her husband, Chris, live in Zionsville, where they’ve raised their four children.

(Photo: Lithium Americas Presentation, June)Cattle rancher Edward Bartell waited patiently to take pictures of Lithium Nevada pumping water from a well the mining company had recently lost the right to use.
“I needed to make sure I caught them pumping and had photographs of them pumping, so I could prove that they were illegally using water,” said Bartell, who holds senior water rights in Thacker Pass.
His photos confirmed what the Nevada Division of Water Resources already suspected during an earlier field investigation. Lithium Nevada was, without a permit and despite a court order to halt, still pumping water from a contested well.
The state sent the mining company a cease and desist order Friday. 
The Nevada Division of Water Resources, which manages public waters in the state, said Lithium Nevada continued using the well despite being notified in April that their water permits were no longer valid.
Lithium Nevada’s water permits were reversed after Nevada’s Sixth Judicial District Court found the state agency erred when they approved two water permits for mining operations in Thacker Pass without properly analyzing whether the action would conflict with Bartell’s senior water rights.
Lithium Nevada was given 14 days to comply with the cease and desist. Bartell said he’s standing watch to ensure they do.
“It’s very frustrating for a family business to try and keep operating our business when the huge mining company comes in and continues to trample our rights and adversely affect the springs and the ecosystem out there,” he said.
He added, “They’re the neighbor from hell.”
Lithium Americas CEO and President Jonathan Evans in a statement to Current said the company would “continue to follow all laws and guidance from our federal and state partners, and are optimistic we will come to a positive resolution with the state.”
Water watchdog group Great Basin Resource Watch said the reversal of previously granted water permits by the Nevada Division of Water Resource was an example of “sloppy permitting” for a project that was approved unusually quickly.
President Donald Trump approved the Thacker Pass lithium mine project in Nevada five days before his first term ended. It was one of several projects fast-tracked by his administration to advance energy and mining development on public land.
“I’ve never seen a cease and desist order from the state on water rights,” said John Hadder, director of Great Basin Resource Watch. “It doesn’t make sense to try to ignore the law.”
“That’s the rush we’re seeing with a lot of this lithium mining. Just push it through. But there’s consequences if you don’t do it right,” he continued.
Lithium Nevada said it’s looking at several options to cover its immediate water needs as construction continues, but that the company is confident further analysis will restore their previous water permits.
“We are excited to be moving forward with construction on the Thacker Pass lithium project to deliver a U.S.-produced lithium supply chain that reduces American dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals,” Evans said in a statement.
Lawsuits and delays have plagued the construction of the planned lithium mine in Nevada for years. Lithium Americas had initially planned to begin lithium production at Thacker Pass by 2026, but several permitting issues and litigation by Nevada tribes and conservation groups helped delay the project. Lithium production at Thacker Pass is now expected to run at full capacity in 2028.
Bartell has been fighting the approval of several water permits awarded to Lithium Nevada for the construction and operation of a massive lithium mine near the Nevada-Oregon border, arguing the mine would deplete the available water for his ranch.
Since 2008, Bartell has used his senior water rights to rear cow calves at his ranch before selling them to buyers across the nation. He fears the water he depends on will soon be drained to extract millions of tons of lithium from clay at Thacker Pass.
“We’ve definitely seen a diminishment of one of the springs. It’s definitely flowing a lot less water than it was,” said Bartell.
Before their permit was revoked, Lithium Nevada was using water from the contested well for construction work. Once the lithium mine is in operation, however, that water would be used to create a slurry out of lithium-infused clay the targeted lithium can be separated from through a complex evaporation process.
While lithium mining is water intensive, Lithium Nevada has repeatedly said their environmental assessment proves Bartell’s ranch will not be negatively affected by their operation.
Bartell was sceptical, arguing “the evidence is very clear that they will dry up our springs, but obviously they will spend enormous sums of money to try and argue otherwise.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-5-8-24-at-4.10-PM-1024x600.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

(CHFS photo)Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball has asked the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) to share information about “a significant number” of denials under Medicaid’s Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW).
Ball sent a letter to the cabinet asking for more information on Tuesday, saying “these denials have raised serious concerns” about waiver eligibility “as well as the broader implications for vulnerable individuals who depend on these critical services.” 
A CHFS spokesperson said the cabinet learned earlier this year of an increase in denials and said a subcontractor wasn’t “correctly examining the Medicaid criteria used to determine if someone requires long-term care services.” 
The cabinet then “required the subcontractor to take action and correct their error,” it says. 
A spokeswoman for Ball said the Ombudsman’s Office, which investigates and resolves complaints about agencies in CHFS, including protective services for children and elderly Kentuckians, received 47 waiver denial appeals since January. 
Joy Pidgorodetska Markland, the communications director for the auditor, said information from the cabinet will help the office to “have a better idea of how to reach families and get a deeper sense of exactly how widespread this problem is.” 
“We were made aware that despite some children having more severe health conditions than when they originally were approved for the waiver, they were nonetheless denied,” Markland said. “It appears that all families received a boilerplate letter with the same language and general reason for denial without any specifics about the child. But beyond that written correspondence, we do not yet know what exactly families have been told about this entire situation.” 
A cabinet spokeswoman said that as of Wednesday, after addressing the subcontractor error, it had “corrected” 112 cases involving children and 67 involving adults. 
“Team Kentucky believes that health care is a basic human right and works to ensure everyone has access to quality care,” Beth Fisher, the deputy executive director in the cabinet’s Office of Public Affairs, said in an email. “We have been transparent with both the public and families about an issue with a subcontractor that has since been resolved.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/agencies-2.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

(Photo by Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)Medicaid patients do not have the right to sue to visit the doctor of their choice, allowing states like South Carolina to remove clinics that also provide abortions from their lists of providers, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to Thursday’s opinion began with a 2018 executive order, in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of medical providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.
Six justices agreed with the decision. One wrote a separate concurring opinion. Three dissented.
Planned Parenthood, which operates two clinics in the state, sued, claiming a patient has the right to visit the clinics for other services, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Medicaid already excludes most abortions, covering them only in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life under a federal provision South Carolina follows.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
A federal appeals court ruled against McMaster’s order three times, deciding the state can’t deny Medicaid patients from going to the provider of their choice because the provider also offers abortions.
Each time, the state’s attorneys appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the issue until December.

The Senate won’t convict a president who has committed high crimes. The Supreme Court will give an insurrectionist president a free pass and grant him king-like immunity. The criminal justice system fails to impose any accountability against a politically powerful felon.
Coloradans can count the governor’s office as yet another institution that won’t save them from the Trump administration’s cruelty and lawlessness. As became clear this week in testimony before a Denver District Court judge, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, at least on some crucial matters, is on team MAGA.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in April sent an administrative subpoena to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment seeking personal information that could improperly expose dozens of residents to immigration enforcement. Colorado has laws that prohibit state personnel from sharing personal identifying information with federal immigration officers except in response to a court-issued subpoena or to assist with a federal criminal investigation.
Polis had ordered that the information be released to ICE, claiming that disclosure was justified under the state law’s criminal-investigation exception. 
A top CDLE manager, Scott Moss, brought a whistleblower lawsuit against Polis to stop what he said would be illegal disclosures. A judge on Wednesday sided with Moss.
A witness on Polis’ side seemed to substantiate Moss’ case during testimony. CDLE director Joe Barela acknowledged under questioning in court that he knew of no evidence that the information sought in the subpoena had anything to do with a criminal investigation. And when Polis lawyer Thomas Rogers III continued to insist that the subpoena was related to a criminal investigation, even Judge A. Bruce Jones had had enough. 
“Am I going to believe you or my own lying eyes?” he said.
The judge’s eyes could see the subpoena itself. It was titled “Immigration Enforcement Subpoena.” It was an administrative document and did not come from a court. It sought extensive personal information, including work and medical records, of 35 people identified as sponsors of unaccompanied child immigrants. 
The only mention in the subpoena of a crime was so open-ended as to be meaningless. It said that Homeland Security Investigations, an agency within ICE, was “conducting investigative activities” to locate unaccompanied immigrant children to ensure they’re not the victims of “crimes,” such as human trafficking.
That’s not a criminal investigation. Not in the legal sense. Not according to common sense. That’s a fishing expedition.
But Polis is on board with it.
No pursuit of the Trump administration so exemplifies its lawlessness and cruelty so much as its immigration enforcement program, which has terrorized communities, stripped residents of due process rights, disappeared people to a brutal foreign prison, targeted individuals who have done nothing more than express a disfavored opinion, and resulted in the arrest of elected officials.
Leaders of Trump’s mass deportation effort originally claimed that it would target violent criminals, but its implementation shows that anyone without residency authorization is at risk, no matter how long they’ve lived in America, no matter how clean their record, no matter how much they’ve contributed to their communities. This week a whistleblower revealed that it was federal Justice Department policy to ignore court orders and withhold information in immigration enforcement cases.
In other words, immigration officials have repeatedly acted in bad faith, yet Polis has chosen to give them the benefit of the doubt. This has come at great cost to Coloradans — not just the countless families in the state who might fear that masked government goons at any time could kidnap one of their own off the street, but also the tens of thousands of residents who grieve the erosion of constitutional order and have registered their fear and anger by marching in multiple protests against ICE’s unaccountable behavior.
As Trump’s return to the presidency approached, many Coloradans took some comfort in assuming that leaders like Polis, a Democrat leading a blue state, might provide some protection against the fascist abuses they suspected, correctly, would issue from Washington. But early on there were ominous indications that Polis was aligned with MAGA, not least the president’s immigration enforcement program. Now it’s clear Polis has made the governor’s office an extension of that program.
Institutions won’t save us. When individual Coloradans take to the streets to demonstrate in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian outrages, they would be justified in including the Colorado governor’s office as an object of protest.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned a controversial earlier decision that had sent alarm through the ski industry in Idaho and nationwide, holding instead that a lower court was right to dismiss a lawsuit from the widow of a skier who died after crashing into a snowmaking tower gun at Sun Valley.
However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed.
“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.”
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.
 Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident

Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions.
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
 Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say

The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails.
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas.
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling:

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others.
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.
In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas.
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

Should Pritzker win and serve a full term, he would become the only three-term Democratic governor in Illinois’ history.

“I’m running for re-election to protect our progress and continue solving the problems we face,” he said in an announcement video. “I love this state, and it’s the honor of my life to serve as your governor – to help lead through the most challenging of times and celebrate the most joyful ones together. I’m ready for the fight ahead.”

Pritzker has not yet announced a running mate to replace Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, who is running for U.S. Senate in 2026.

The state GOP issued a statement saying Pritzker should be “fired not re-hired.”

“He’s prioritized illegal immigrants over Illinois families, hiked taxes, and rammed through the largest, most bloated budget in state history,” ILGOP Chairman Kathy Salvi said in a statement.

The governor’s political future has been the topic of significant speculation, especially since he was shortlisted for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate search last summer in her campaign for the White House. That and his vocal and frequent condemnations of President Donald Trump have fueled speculation of a presidential run in 2028.

The announcement that he will run for governor does not prohibit a future presidential run, because governor and president are not up in the same election cycle.

Several Republicans have announced plans to run for governor. DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick said he would run earlier this year. Mechanic and Posen Park District Commissioner Phil Perez and businessman Joe Severino have also publicly said they are running, while Cook County GOP Chair Aaron Del Mar is also mulling a run.

Oregon-headquartered Hampton Lumber announced it will build the new $225 million mill near the town of Fairfax. The 375,000-square-foot mill is expected to make framing lumber used in home construction, with production scheduled to begin in 2027.
“This investment will benefit not only our state’s timber farmers but will also offer quality jobs in a largely rural and agricultural part of the state,” state Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers said in a statement.
And State Forester Scott Phillips called the mill a “welcome boost to the industry and to communities that rely on forestry for economic opportunity.”
The mill is expected to buy southern yellow pine common in South Carolina, a potential shot in the arm to a state timber industry that has been struggling amid closures of major paper mills.
“We’re happy to join the healthy wood products industry already present in the region, and we look forward to building partnerships in the area and supporting the communities in and around Allendale County,” Hampton Lumber CEO Randy Schillinger said in a statement.
It’s also a boost for Allendale County, among the state’s poorest counties with historically high jobless rates. The county’s 4.8% unemployment rate last month ranked 10th highest, according to the state Department of Employment and Workforce.
SouthernCarolina Alliance President Danny Black, the head of the region’s economic development agency, said Allendale County Council is considering a deal that would lower Hampton Lumber’s property taxes to a 4% rate for 40 years in exchange for the company’s investment.
By state law, manufacturers without such an arrangement pay a 6% rate. (Industrial property owners previously paid a 10.5% rate, but state laws passed in 2017 and 2022 effectively lowered it to 6%.)
The state also approved the company for income tax credits worth $25,000 per new job annually.
“Hampton Lumber’s new operation in Allendale County will be a notable addition to our state’s forestry industry, while also providing opportunities for our people and contributing to the local economy,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate is working on the “big, beautiful bill” — a massive tax package that gives money directly to the wealthiest Americans while gutting programs that help everyday South Dakotans. If passed, this bill would cause devastating harm through deep cuts to Medicaid, higher health care costs for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, and automatic cuts to Medicare.
This bill will increase the federal deficit, resulting in the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act (PAYGO) to kick in. That law requires automatic, across-the-board cuts to programs like Medicare unless Congress intervenes. So not only does this bill extend $1.1 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, it pulls the rug out from under those who rely on Medicare just to get by.
The human cost of this legislation is staggering.
As someone who works directly with people experiencing homelessness, I witness every day what a lack of health care looks like. It’s the untreated infections that escalate into emergencies. It’s the missed mental health support that results in a crisis. It’s the addiction that goes unaddressed because there are no accessible recovery services. It’s the quiet suffering of people who are told — explicitly or implicitly — that their lives are expendable in the name of tax cuts for the rich.
Thune, other GOP leaders in US Senate struggle to lessen pain of Medicaid cuts for rural hospitals

And as a pediatrician, I’ve seen firsthand how children suffer when the health care safety net is dismantled. I’ve seen children arrive at shelters sick, scared, and in need of urgent care that their families simply couldn’t afford. Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in South Dakota and provides essential services like immunizations, developmental screenings, and early interventions that can change the course of a child’s life. Without it, preventable illnesses go untreated, mental health conditions worsen, and families are left with nowhere to turn. Children don’t get a second chance at healthy development. We must protect their access to care now.
Children, people with disabilities, older adults, and rural communities will bear the brunt of this proposal. Medicaid is not just a safety net; it is a lifeline. In South Dakota, Medicaid expansion has helped thousands access preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health services — often for the first time in their lives. This bill would unravel that progress.
It’s not just individuals who will suffer. This legislation threatens the very institutions that keep our communities alive — hospitals, senior-living centers, and nursing homes. Many of these facilities operate on razor-thin margins and rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement to stay open. If this bill passes, South Dakota will see closures, especially in rural areas where there is no backup option. When the local hospital closes, people die. When a senior center shuts its doors, families are left scrambling to care for aging loved ones without support.
And for what? To fund permanent tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. That’s not fiscal responsibility. That’s cruelty disguised as budgeting.
There is still time to act. Congress can let the Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire. Congress can still extend the tax cuts for the hardworking middle and low-income earners. These two things are not mutually exclusive.
Instead of the federal government forcing states like South Dakota to shoulder more health care costs, citizens should have access to the critical programs that keep them healthy — especially our children, whose futures depend on it.

(Photo by Allen Stegeman/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Alaska, like other states around the nation, is compiling a 10-year plan to guide conservation of sometimes vulnerable wildlife populations. Alaska’s State Wildlife Action Plan, which is in draft form, identifies “species of greatest conservation need” because of declining populations, changing habitat, development, invasive species threats, knowledge gaps or other concerns.
But now the federal funding that supports Alaska’s State Wildlife Action Plan and those of other states is itself vulnerable.
The Trump administration proposes to zero out funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s entire State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program, established in 2000. The program distributes money to states to use on conservation projects that are designed in accordance with wildlife action plans. For Alaska, the most recent grant funding was about $2.76 million.
In its Fish and Wildlife Service budget summary, the Trump administration pitched elimination of the grant funding as part of a shift to the private sector.
“Although FWS is responsible for conserving trust resources across broad landscapes, its work to conserve natural resources is impossible without partnerships with States, Tribes, and private landowners. In recognition of this, the 2026 Budget will eliminate grants to States and Tribes that come with strings attached on the types of species they should conserve. These eliminations will be complemented by FWS investments in partnerships with private landowners,” the summary said.
The summary does not identify the “strings” that the administration contends limit states’ actions.
While Alaska and other states must have 10-year wildlife action plans to qualify for the federal grants, the states choose how those grants will be distributed, said an official with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s Division of Wildlife Conservation.
State Wildlife Grants “are implemented at the discretion of the states,” said Lindsey Nietmann in an email. She is the coordinator of the division’s threatened, endangered and diversity program.
A key goal of the plan in Alaska and those in other states is to address possible wildlife problems before they get serious enough to warrant the drastic step of Endangered Species Act listing, said state biologist Julie Hagelin.
“An important general principle is that it’s more cost effective to maintain or manage or mitigate threats to ensure sustainable populations of wildlife, sort of in a proactive way, rather than the need to go to great lengths and expense and sort of have prescriptive regulatory burdens that the federal government imposes through the ESA,” said Hagelin, a conservation and management coordinator with the Division of Wildlife Conservation.
The concept fits Alaska’s constitutional mandate for sustained yield and is “consistent with this idea of being proactive and caring for the long-term sustainability of our natural and wildlife,” Hagelin said.

	A variety of work to mitigate threats has been funded by the federal grants. Recent projects include research into Alaska bats and the dangers they may be facing from white-nosed syndrome, a fungal disease that has killed large numbers of Lower 48 bats; monitoring of the Aleutian tern, a migratory bird that breeds only in coastal Alaska and neighboring parts of Siberia and is believed to be declining in population; and studies of forest practices that are best for regeneration and protection of habitat used by bird and mammal species.
The State Wildlife Grant Program appears to be popular nationally.
“This program provides critical funding to every U.S. state and territory to plan and implement proactive conservation actions to prevent the nation’s fish and wildlife from becoming endangered,” the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says on its website. “The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program is considered the core program for keeping species healthy and off the federal threatened and endangered species list, a goal shared by a broad constituency of conservationists, business, farmers, ranchers, and land developers.”
“The State Wildlife Grants program has allowed the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and its partners to accomplish so much more for Iowa’s Natural Resources than was possible before its inception,” the Iowa Department of Natural Resources website says. “State Wildlife Grants is the nation’s most important program in keeping species from becoming endangered.”
“State Wildlife Grants save taxpayers millions of dollars,” the Georgia Department of Natural Resources website says. “Taking action to conserve wildlife before it becomes endangered is environmentally sound and fiscally responsible. Once a species drops to the point of potential extinction, recovery efforts become risky and expensive. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
Even the first Trump administration lauded the program. In 2020, the final year of the first Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service released a publication that touted it as providing “20 years of conservation success.”
However, the first Trump administration attempted that year to slash funding for the program by more than $20 million, though not eliminate it. Congress wound up appropriating about the same amount in that budget as had been appropriated in other recent years.
The wildlife grants continue to enjoy bipartisan support in Congress, if a recent letter signed by 42 U.S. senators is any indication.

The federal grant program distributed about $55 million in total to states to be used at their discretion for work this year. Alaska, California and Texas received equal amounts and were the top recipients. That has been the case every year since 2002, with annual amounts that ranged from about $2.3 million to over $3.8 million.
Related Fish and Wildlife Service grants are awarded to tribal governments across the nation. That tribal grant program distributed about $6 million for projects this year. In Alaska, tribal governments have used grants from that program for projects that include fish surveys in Southeast Alaska to clam restoration work in Prince William Sound to habitat surveys in Seward Peninsula areas that might be affected by mine development.
Another related program provides grants on a competitive basis totaling about $7 million a year. One recent Alaska project that won a competitive grant concerned research into the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whale population.
If the grants survive, a wide range of Alaska species could benefit.

	Alaska’s new wildlife action plan, in draft form, identifies 362 vertebrates as being of “greatest conservation need,” a number that includes 188 bird species, 101 fish species, 43 terrestrial mammals, 25 marine mammals and five amphibians. That is far fewer than the approximately 20 Alaska populations with Endangered Species Act protection.
One species identified as being of greatest conservation need is the Alaska hare, sometimes called the tundra hare. It is known for its large size – up to 15 pounds, much larger than the more abundant snowshoe hare – but a lot of other details about the population remain unknown.
There are historical accounts from biologists and local hunters who described seeing groups of hundreds of Alaska hares, Hagelin said. “And now it’s pretty rare to find groups of more than three to four individuals,” she said. Aside from those indicators of decline, wildlife managers are faced with a scarcity of information about Alaska hares in general, including their population status and habitat use, she said. “It’s all kind of poorly understood.”
Recent research that was funded in part by the federal grant program enabled biologists to engage in some “epic snowmachine surveys” in which they gathered hare pellets and tagged some animals to piece together genetic and population information, Hagelin said. Information from that work helped lead to some hunting restrictions imposed by the state Board of Game and Federal Subsistence Board, she said.
Another species identified as being among those of “greatest conservation need” is the gray-headed chickadee, previously known as the Siberian tit. Their range extends across the circumpolar north, from Siberia to northern Asia to North America, but the Alaska population appears to have declined.
For the most part, the list of species in the draft 2025 State Wildlife Action Plan is the same as that in the 2015 plan. There are 37 more identified in the new plan, largely because of habitat changes that have affected aquatic species.
An important new element is a more precise methodology for selecting species of greatest conservation need, Hagelin said. That uses a ranking system developed by the Alaska Center for Conservation Science at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
In addition to guiding federally funded projects, the State Wildlife Action Plan helps Alaska coordinate management actions with other states, Hagelin said. That is important to protecting migratory birds that spend the summer breeding seasons in the Arctic or subarctic, where habitats are more likely to be intact, but spend other parts of the year in southern habitats that may be more compromised, she said.
Generally, the plan does not apply to game species that are widely hunted, such as caribou, because there are numerous other programs and revenue sources that provide money used for management and conservation, she said.
Likewise, it does not concentrate much on fish that are the subject of big commercial or sport harvests, as those fisheries have their own management and funding systems. And it does not include plants, though other states’ plans do extend to plant species. Texas is among the states that includes plants in its wildlife action plan, and it has a total of about 1,200 identified species of greatest conservation need, Hagelin said.
The State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program is among several Fish and Wildlife Service-managed programs that the Trump administration has targeted for funding elimination.
The administration’s budget proposes no money for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, the Multinational Species Conservation Fund and the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. Each of those funds got between $5 million and $49 million in funding for the current fiscal year.

DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein urged his advisors to stay open-minded while also hinting at the possibility of disentangling state policy from the Trump administration.
The post State experts mulling federal vaccine policy shifts, Mass. response appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS TURMOIL engulfed a federal vaccine advisory panel earlier this month, Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein urged his own set of advisors to stay open-minded while also hinting at the possibility of disentangling state policy from the Trump administration.
That philosophy could be tested later Wednesday and Thursday, as the CDC’s revamped Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meets and reviews a vaccine ingredient that US Health and Human Health Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. has previously — and, experts say, erroneously — linked to conditions like autism. Kennedy fired all 17 ACIP members on June 9 and made eight new appointments days later.
The Massachusetts Vaccine Purchasing Advisory Council (MVPAC) orients its work closely around guidance from the ACIP. At its recent meeting, Goldstein acknowledged the upheaval at the federal panel has been “in some ways, very alarming.”
“I guess I want to say to this group that’s here that I think it is our responsibility to keep an open mind about what is happening, to analyze the data as they’re presented to ACIP, to think like an ACIP member in the next two weeks, and to use this body to have our own deliberation and our own discussion,” Goldstein said on June 12. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to jump to conclusions that what ACIP decides at the end of June is necessarily wrong or necessarily right. I think it’s our responsibility to look at the data that are presented, to listen to the deliberation, and to come to our own conclusions — and they may be the same.”
Kennedy said he chose to do a “clean sweep” and reconstitute the panel “to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science.” The secretary later wrote on social media that his new appointees include “highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America’s most accomplished physicians.”
Goldstein pointed out one of those new members is Dr. H. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, who also happens to be on the MVPAC.
“I think Dr. Meissner has shown a commitment to the science, a commitment to evidence, a commitment to vaccine policies that protect the commonwealth, protect people across this country,” Goldstein said. “And so I’m hopeful that there are more like him on the advisory committee as it is repopulated.”
One of the dismissed ACIP members was Dr. Lin Chen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in a letter to Kennedy on Tuesday, said the panel’s new members “include vaccine skeptics, medical professionals with conflicts of interest, and individuals without any apparent experience conducting studies of vaccines, counseling patients about vaccines, or administering vaccines.”
“As presently constituted, the committee lacks the qualifications and credibility to offer the nation credible advice on vaccines,” Warren wrote.
The ACIP’s role is to make recommendations about vaccine safety, efficacy and clinical need to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to HHS.
Meanwhile, the MVPAC’s mission is to help DPH distribute ACIP-recommended childhood vaccines “to ensure the health and safety of the Commonwealth’s citizens.” Some members are designated by DPH, the Center for Health Information and Analysis, the Massachusetts Academy of Pediatrics, the Massachusetts Medical Society and health insurers.
The MVPAC makes its purchasing recommendations using principles such as safety and efficacy, cost and supply issues, provider and patient issues, and market share, according to the body’s guiding principles. Aiming to “maximize vaccine coverage and minimize provider confusion, vaccine waste and administration errors,” the MVPAC says it also “will avoid to the degree possible making significant changes to their periodic purchasing recommendations except as indicated by their careful assessment of the factors outlined in these principles.”
Before coming to DPH, Goldstein worked as a senior policy advisor at the CDC during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Goldstein said state public health officials have been working to gauge how Massachusetts fits into the “complicated federal landscape,” including within the legal and regulatory arena.
“So what laws, what regulation do we have here in Massachusetts that either tie us to CDC recommendations and ACIP, or may need to be amended to make sure that we can use evidence and science to drive our decisions and our recommendations,” the commissioner said.
“The work falls into a second bucket, which is how do we maintain access and purchase ability for these vaccines,” Goldstein continued. “And we are making sure that, no matter what happens at the federal level, we will continue to be able to purchase vaccines here in Massachusetts, distribute them across the commonwealth, and make sure there’s access in pediatrics practices, community health centers, hospitals all across the state.”
Gov. Maura Healey, asked Monday how Massachusetts may need to extricate itself from federal vaccine policy, said Goldstein and DPH are evaluating the matter.
“We’re going to continue to provide vaccinations here in Massachusetts,” Healey told reporters.
Kennedy last month announced the CDC is no longer recommending COVID vaccines for healthy pregnant women and children. Goldstein has emphasized COVID shots remain available, and they can prevent serious illness and death for at-risk individuals.
The ACIP is meeting at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, with opening remarks slated for 10 a.m. Wednesday. 
“The work prior to an ACIP meeting is extensive, and the amount of data that are evaluated by working groups and presented to the full committee is enormous,” Goldstein had said earlier in June. “I am interested to see, at the end of this month, brand new members of ACIP that are able to make informed decisions about vaccine policy.”
A previous agenda for this week’s ACIP meeting listed votes on vaccine recommendations for COVID, RSV and flu shots, among other immunizations. The finalized itinerary scraps some votes, and includes a presentation about thimerosal in vaccines and recommendations about the ingredient in flu shots.
Kennedy wrote a book in 2014 about the dangers of thimerosal, which the CDC and health experts have debunked, according to Politico. In her letter, Warren called the ACIP’s planned vote on thimerosal-containing vaccines a “dog whistle for vaccine skeptics.”
As questions swirl around pending federal recommendations and how the public will react to Kennedy’s updated panel, Goldstein emphasized the role of MVPAC in promoting trust in vaccine policy.
“I cannot say this enough, that the damage that is done when people in the federal government talk about vaccines with mis- and disinformation, when they share fringe theories about vaccines, the damage that is done to trust in public health and vaccine programs is enormous,” Goldstein said, without invoking specific individuals or examples. “I have been trying to use my position to speak about the benefits of vaccines as much as I possibly can. I think that we need to continue to do so — all of us.”
Healey called Kennedy a “threat to public health” during the Health Equity Trends Summit earlier this month. She described engaging with the federal government as playing “opposite day” with children.
“If they want to defund science and research, we will fund science and research,” Healey had said, drawing audience applause and cheers. “If they want to dismantle the CDC and vaccine infrastructure, we’re going to find a way to build, and make, and distribute our own, and we’re going to make sure people have access to it equitably.”

Grace Sweeten, a ninth-grader at Sussex Academy in Georgetown, and Vivian Wan, a tenth-grader at Tower Hill School in Wilmington, were among 75 first-place winners selected from thousands of student submissions across the country.
Sweeten was honored for her original artwork, “Mother of Refuge,” while Wan earned recognition for her essay, “The American Mosaic.”
“America’s Field Trip is a transformative opportunity for students across the country to engage with our nation’s history in meaningful, lasting ways,” said Rosie Rios, chair of America250. “Our tentpole programs are intentionally designed to be hands-on, educational, and engaging. America’s Field Trip truly brings the story of America to life and allows a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for these students to experience American history and national treasures up-close.”
Both students’ works will be featured in an upcoming exhibit at the Delaware Public Archives, organizers announced this week.
America’s Field Trip invites students from grades 3 through 12 to reflect creatively on the question, “What does America mean to you?”
This year’s competition drew submissions from all 50 states, five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.
First-place winners will take part in field trips to historic and cultural landmarks across the U.S. this summer, while second-place winners receive a $500 prize.
“It’s an honor for Delaware to have two students recognized as first place winners in the America’s Field Trip contest,” said Margaret Hughes, director of Delaware 250. “We’re so proud of what Grace and Vivian have accomplished, and grateful to them for sharing their vision of America.”
The contest is part of a broader educational initiative by America250, the national commission leading preparations for the country’s Semiquincentennial in 2026. Organizers aim to foster civic reflection and participation through hands-on, inclusive programming.

,DC,2025-06-26 13:36:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump urges voters to press for US Senate GOP mega-bill after setback on Medicaid cuts,"Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-urges-voters-press-us-senate-gop-mega-bill-after-setback-medicaid-cuts,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Thursday told his supporters to call members of Congress and lobby them to support the “big, beautiful bill,” a crucial push with just days to go before a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.Trump’s plea follows several tumultuous days on Capitol Hill as GOP leaders struggled to find consensus on multiple policy disagreements, especially after the parliamentarian ruled core elements of the package don’t meet the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill.Trump during an event in the White House’s East Room that was attended by several GOP lawmakers also cautioned Republicans against voting down the tax and spending cut package.“We don’t want to have grandstanders,” Trump said. “Not good people. They know who I'm talking about. I call them out. But we don’t need grandstanders. We have to get our country back and bring it back strong.”Some Republican senators remain optimistic they can work through the weekend and that the House votes will come together next week, despite growing opposition from members in that chamber.Sen. Eric Schmitt said he doesn’t think the parliamentarian’s rulings will delay the votes “outside the weekend window, which has been the goal all the time.”“We're probably voting into the weekend, though. That's probably my guess — Saturday and I suppose even Sunday — but, that's the goal, I don't think that materially changes too much,” the Missouri Republican said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., however, appeared a bit less definite, telling reporters in the afternoon that he didn’t know when the chamber would take the procedural vote that kicks off floor consideration.“I’ll get back to you on that,” he said.Medicaid provisions tossedEarlier Thursday, Senate Republicans suffered a significant setback when the parliamentarian ruled several changes to Medicaid in the bill don’t comply with the rules, which means billions of dollars in savings are no longer available for the GOP to offset the cost of tax cuts.Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo. R-Idaho, must rework or completely eliminate nine changes the committee proposed to the health care programs, though more of the panel’s proposals are still under review.Republicans can no longer reduce the amount of federal matching funds for state governments that use their own tax dollars to provide Medicaid coverage for immigrants in the country without proper documentation.The GOP bill cannot bar gender-affirming care for Medicaid patients.And Republicans need to change or scrap a proposal to reduce states’ Medicaid provider tax credits, an issue that is relatively in the weeds of health care policy but has sharply divided the GOP and drawn fierce opposition from states.The changes or eliminations will have a major impact on how much in savings the GOP tax and spending cut bill will generate during the next decade and will likely make the overall package’s deficit impact higher than before.

Robert Byrd, includes several guardrails for reconciliation bills.Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote in a statement that the parliamentarian’s ruling will lead to “more than $250 billion in health care cuts removed from the Republicans’ big bad bill.“Democrats fought and won, striking health care cuts from this bill that would hurt Americans’ walking on an economic tightrope. This bill is rotten to its core, and I’ll keep fighting the cuts in this morally bankrupt bill until the end.”The parliamentarian is still deciding whether several health provisions meet reconciliation rules, including language that would block all Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, effectively blocking Medicaid patients from visiting the organization for routine health services.Federal law already bars funding for abortions with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient.The parliamentarian will also decide later whether Republicans’ bill can block the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing a Biden-era rule that would require nursing homes to have a nurse working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Higher ed provisions axedThe parliamentarian also struck down several attempts from congressional Republicans to overhaul the higher education system.GOP lawmakers cannot streamline student loan repayment options for current borrowers to just a standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment plan, making such restrictions apply to only new borrowers.Republicans have to nix a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are for-profit and not accredited.The parliamentarian scrapped a proposal that would have barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.The federal program eliminates remaining debt for borrowers when meeting certain requirements, including working for a qualified employer within the government or nonprofit sector.The parliamentarian rejected GOP lawmakers’ proposal to end federal student aid eligibility for certain immigrants who are not U.S. citizens.‘Too many Medicaid cuts’Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said the parliamentarian’s ruling on the Medicaid provider tax rate will give lawmakers “a chance to get it right.”“This is a chance for the Senate to fix a problem that they created and not defund rural hospitals,” Hawley said, later adding he supports the House language that would freeze the rate at 6% instead of decreasing it to 3.5% over several years. Hawley said hours before Trump’s event that he expects the president to get more involved in negotiations now that he’s back from a NATO conference in Europe and said Trump was in a “terrific mood” during a recent phone call.“I think he wants this done. But he wants it done well. And he does not want this to be a Medicaid cuts bill,” Hawley said. “He made that very clear to me. He said this is a tax cut bill, it's not a Medicaid cuts bill. I think he's tired of hearing about all these Medicaid cuts, you know. As am I. It's because there are too many Medicaid cuts.”Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy early Thursday night called on leaders to put the House’s language regarding Medicaid back into the bill, wiping out changes made by the Finance Committee.“My position is that cuts, and especially drastic cuts, to Medicaid have to be avoided. The Senate bill cuts Medicaid too much,” the influential chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee wrote in a social media post. “I agree with President Trump, the House version is better.”SNAP cutsThe Agriculture Committee also is reworking parts of its bill, some being closely watched by states, to meet the rules that govern reconciliation.Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., said he expects to hear from the parliamentarian before the end of Thursday about whether a revised state cost share provision for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that's based on error rate payments will be in the final bill.""It was thrown out the first time, so we actually gave her revised text. If she rules the revised text is fine, then we'll release it,"" Boozman said.The committee released a statement later in the day announcing the parliamentarian had cleared the revised state cost share for SNAP that’s based on a state’s error payment rate.States that have SNAP error payment rates higher than 6% will have to contribute some of the cost of the program. The updated proposal will give states the option of choosing between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 to determine their match, which will begin during fiscal 2028. After that, a state’s match will be determined by its error payment rate for the last three fiscal years. State and local tax, ‘revenge tax’Senate Republicans also remained stuck on finding a deduction level for state and local tax, or SALT, that passes muster with House Republicans who represent high-tax blue states.The House version would allow taxpayers making under $500,000 to deduct up to $40,000 in SALT from their federal tax bill. Both the $40,000 cap and the $500,000 income threshold will increase annually at 1% until hitting a ceiling of $44,000 and $552,000. The deduction cap phases down for higher earners.Senate Republicans and the White House sought to lower the income threshold but were shot down Thursday by House Republicans, according to multiple reports.Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, the lead negotiator on SALT for Senate Republicans, said he remained optimistic.""We're gonna be in a good spot. We're gonna find a landing spot,"" Mullin said.A Senate Finance Committee spokesperson declined to comment on current negotiations, including any proposed income level changes.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also weighed in on another tax provision: the so-called “revenge tax” on investments from countries whose trade policies the president views as unfair to U.S. businesses.Bessent asked lawmakers to remove the up to 20% tax from the mega-bill following an agreement made with G7 partners, he wrote on social media.“This understanding with our G7 partners provides greater certainty and stability for the global economy and will enhance growth and investment in the United States and beyond,” Bessent said.The retaliation tax would have raised roughly $116 billion over 10 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Timing on votesRepublican lawmakers don’t have much time left to rework all of the ineligible provisions, clear them with the parliamentarian, read through final bill text, slog through a marathon amendment voting session in the Senate and then move the bill through the House before their self-imposed deadline.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing before Trump’s event that the president is ""adamant"" Congress must pass the ""big, beautiful bill” within the next week, despite the latest ruling.  ""We expect that bill to be on the president's desk for signature by July Fourth. I know there was a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian this morning,” Leavitt said. “Look, this is part of the process, this is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate. But the president is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day.""",,,,2025-06-26 19:05:24.226906

At a hearing on Beacon Hill, Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability bill was met with praise from lawmakers, but Sen. Barrett and Rep. Turco raised questions about Mass Save and the overall affordability of the green energy transition.
The post Healey’s energy affordability bill gets support, tough questions on Beacon Hill appeared first on CommonWealth B[...]","GOV. MAURA HEALEY’S sweeping energy affordability bill received a largely positive reception from lawmakers at a nearly six-hour hearing on Wednesday, but even lawmakers who lauded the proposal had some concerns. 
Healey unveiled the bill in May in response to a winter that saw sharp increases in natural gas bills across the state. The legislation aims to reduce certain charges on energy bills, keep unnecessary costs from being passed to ratepayers, and expand the state’s authority to explore new nuclear power technologies. 
After a cold winter that had residents across the state struggling to make ends meet, Healey’s aim is to lower rate payer bills while still moving forward on the state’s mandated climate goals. She faces a challenging balancing act as the Trump administration pulls federal funding from climate efforts and takes aim at offshore wind – a potentially abundant source of clean energy for Massachusetts.
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy who was the driving force behind the climate law which passed in November 2024, said that he was “impressed with the sheer intelligence and ingenuity of the fine print” of the bill.
But he also questioned whether Healey’s plan to allow the Department of Public Utilities to authorize utility companies to issue bonds to fund Mass Save would cost ratepayers more in the long run. “We would move from pay-as-you-go to an alternative that requires the payment of interest on long-term bonds,” said Barrett.  “One would think that would be an additional financing cost, and that over the entire cost of the useful life of the project, more dollars might wind up being spent either by our taxpayers or by our ratepayers.”
Mass Save, which is currently funded entirely through surcharges on utility customers, accounted for the biggest portion of the increase in natural gas rates this past winter. The program’s cost is updated only every three years, and an unusually cold winter amplified the effect of the rate increase.
Rebecca Tepper, the state secretary of energy and environmental affairs, said the DPU would be reviewing any plan to issue bonds for Mass Save, and that the agency would only move forward on allowing this means of financing if it is in the interest of customers. The utility companies would not make a profit on the bonds, she added.
Barrett also expressed concern that, in the absence of offshore wind, the state would be more reliant on solar but that the proposed legislation would lower the rate – known as the “net metering compensation rate” – non-residential solar panel owners are compensated when they send energy back into the grid. According to the Healey administration, Massachusetts has the highest net metering rate in the country, and lowering the rate will save customers an estimated $380 million over 10 years. High net metering rates can mean that the costs of maintaining the electric grid are disproportionately borne by non-solar customers and utility companies might have to raise rates for all customers to offset the revenue lost from paying solar producers at a higher rate.
“We want to indicate we need more solar because offshore wind is going to be very slow off the mark, given what President Trump is doing,” said Barrett. “But in the next breath, we assure people that we’re going to reduce the value of net metering. How are you going to get more solar during a period – when it may be our primary source of clean energy over the next four years – and somehow make it less lucrative to the developers?”
Healey’s undersecretary of energy, Michael Judge, testified that the lowered net metering rate would only impact certain large net metering facilities. Currently, those facilities receive close to “double what any other state in the country provides to solar,” he said. 
“I don’t think it should have any … negative impact on solar development or the pace of solar development in Massachusetts, but it should allow us to build it at a lower cost,” he added.
The legislation gives the state more flexibility in how energy is procured from the state. Barrett asked Healey to clarify if the state would include sources like solar, nuclear, and hydropower under the new procurement framework. Elizabeth Mahoney, commissioner of the Department of Energy Resources, said that all different sources will be part of the procurement plan to meet the state’s climate goals.
Rep. Jeffrey Turco, who represents Winthrop and parts of Revere, expressed doubts that energy affordability and the transition to green energy could go hand in hand.
“What is the priority of the administration: Green energy or rate pay relief?” asked Turco. “Because it seems to me that the reality of the last year or two with our rates is that you can’t have both.”
In response, Healey said she was taking an “all of the above approach” to get as much energy as possible onto the grid from different sources. She said that she is looking at “all options” and that she wants to address some of the “immediate hurt” of the energy affordability crisis.
“[With] some of the programs that have served the Commonwealth well – where can we scale back right now?” said Healey. “Because people have got to be able to put food on the table, especially with the other the other cuts that that we’re likely to see from the federal administration.”
Healey’s legislation would also phase out a program that provides incentives to businesses for installing “alternative energy systems” that contribute to the state’s clean energy goals by increasing energy efficiency, reform the competitive supply market to protect customers from predatory practices by third-party electric suppliers, and allow the Department of Public Utilities to cap the amount of month-to-month bill increases.
Carrie Katan from the nonprofit Green Energy Consumer Alliance said that her group supports the consumer protections in Healey’s bill around third-party electric suppliers – which have come under fire for predatory marketing and major price hikes. Many environmental and energy affordability advocates, including Katan, as well as more than a dozen municipal leaders across the state support an outright ban on third-party suppliers.
“If we cannot get a ban, we would love if there is legislation that protects people from the worst abuses of the system,” Katan said in an interview. “That would still be a massive win for the people of the commonwealth.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Mike Duggan may be mayor of the Motor City, but he was one of the most popular attractions on the vehicle-free Mackinac Island during the Detroit Regional Chamber’s annual policy conference last month.
As mayor of Detroit, Duggan is one of two people – along with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – guaranteed a keynote speaking slot during the Mackinac Policy Conference.
He used this year’s address to roll out his plan to invest $4.5 billion in schools while promoting his independent campaign for governor, contrasting himself with Republican and Democratic attack ads alike.
The next day, he highlighted Detroit’s comeback during a panel with Rocket Mortgage founder and philanthropist Dan Gilbert.
April Ryan, Washington bureau chief and White House correspondent for Black Press USA, underscored Duggan’s arguments about partisan politics during a separate panel on the final day of the conference, saying Duggan’s polling – indicating that he pulls nearly equal amounts of support from Republicans and Democrats – shows “the system is broken.”
“Certain groups felt … like they weren’t heard. And the problem is we have to find a way to get everyone under the umbrella,” Ryan said. “That’s why independents are on the rise, and people are listening, because people don’t feel heard. People want to feel seen.”
The Michigan Advance caught up with Duggan about his campaign taking on both the Democratic and Republican candidates for governor as an independent.
The Democratic field to succeed term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer currently includes Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki.
Republicans who have entered the race include former Attorney General Mike Cox, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.), former House Speaker Tom Leonard, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former congressional candidate Anthony Hudson and construction manager William Null.

The following are excerpts from the Advance’s interview with Duggan:
 
You mentioned during your keynote address that a bad system will always beat a good person. If we’re in a bad system now, what does that mean for your campaign?
“Well, I think people in Michigan are really internalizing now that with this divided state and the continual 50-50 Republican and Democrat split in the Legislature that we are going to keep swinging back and forth. And people are feeling the impact of that. They feel the impact in the schools. They feel the impact in the economic policies. I’m offering a different alternative, and I’m finding a lot of people receptive.”
 
You mentioned how policy goals will swing back and forth with Republican and Democratic governors and legislators. You’re running as an independent. How effective can you be at changing that as governor if you don’t have similarly independent legislators to work with?
“When you have a 56-54 margin, and you’re in the 56, your most extreme three or four people control your agenda. And that pulls the two parties to the extremes – what makes people so angry in these evenly divided systems – because you’re obsessed with having a majority and your majority passing a bill that your party gets credit for.
“I’m going to try a different approach: The approach I took at the city of Detroit and City Council, where I sat down with Council, people had their own opinions, and I said, we’re going to agree on principles that apply to all of us.
“I laid out a set of principles for the schools that said let’s put $4.5 billion in the schools without raising taxes, let’s have a clear reading curriculum, let’s build the CTE program, and let’s hold principals and superintendents accountable for performance.
“I think most people in the two parties can agree to that. Now, there’s people on one extreme that say you shouldn’t have to have accountability in schools, and people on the other extreme that says you ought to have vouchers. But I think most people in this state would say put money in the school system, teach the kids to read, give us CTE options that are real and hold them accountable.
“That’s what I believe. And I think I can forge a coalition in the middle of Republicans and Democrats who say this is the Michigan solution, it’s not a Democratic or a Republican solution.”
 
You’ve talked about the purpose of the campaign being to take on a broken system. Why run for governor rather than, say, a ballot proposal to literally change the system?
“Well, we had a ballot proposal, right? We eliminated gerrymandering, and now you have an evenly divided Legislature – which is the state, it actually reflects the state. It had an unintended consequence that you have almost complete gridlock in the Legislature.
“I think what has been done at the legislative level, or the ballot proposal level, has been done. I think you have to have a change in politics.
“If you watch what happened in Detroit when I ran in 2013, the definition of politics in Detroit was us versus them. It was Black versus white, city versus suburbs, city versus Lansing. And people thought that a white guy in an 83% Black city would never have a chance to be elected.
“But the people of Detroit have overwhelmingly supported me, because there were things more important to them in terms of common values and common strategies.
“I think with what’s happened in the city of Detroit, by people pulling together, not only have I done well, our City Council is at a 60% approval rating. You don’t see that in other cities. Our legislative branch found that a consistent plan that delivered results was good for them as well as good for the mayor.”
 
You’ve argued that people are tired of Democrats versus Republicans. Why is Democrats versus Republicans versus Mike Duggan preferable?
“We’re going to get a chance to see, but just look at the toxic ads that you have. The Gallup polls show we’re down to 27% of Americans who consider themselves Democrats, all time low, 27% Republicans, all time low, 43% independents, all time high.
“But the campaign managers know that you’re starting out with only a 27% base. The way they get from 27% to 51% isn’t to explain their affordable housing plan, it’s demonize the other person.
“I showed the ad calling people pedophile protectors and insane and the ads that people are running. They run the ads because all you have to do is demonize the other party to 51%.
“If I’m in the race, you can’t just demonize the Republicans or Democrats. You’re going to have to actually say what you’re for, and it is going to be a very different dynamic.
“I think there are a handful of congressional people who have already figured this out and are figuring out ‘okay, this guy’s going to get 30-40% of the vote as an independent, I’m going to need his independent voters to vote for me in a U.S. Senate race or in a Congressional race.’
“You’re going to start to see, I believe, other candidates modify their positions to talk about what they’re for in order to get elected. At least that’s what I’m hoping to do, because I’m running to change the system.”
 
Does running as an independent force you to spend more time convincing people that you are a viable candidate rather than being able to talk about those issues?
“For sure it does. But I lived this once already.
“If you had been in the living rooms with me when I ran for mayor, and people would show up and say, I like you, but there’s no way a white guy can win an 83% Black city, and then after a couple months, they saw me the second and third time, and some of their friends are saying, I’m looking at this guy, and they said, maybe he can. And by the time we were done, I carried 92% of the precincts.
“But what you’re saying is absolutely right. It wasn’t the first time, it wasn’t the second time, but I’m seeing the same thing here. People are showing up in large numbers, mainly out of curiosity to hear the independent guy.
“I was in Lexington last Tuesday, town of 1,000 people; 100 people showed up and spent an hour and a half with me. At some point, I said to them, how many of you would have showed up if I were running as a Democrat? Half the hands in the room went up, and then everybody started laughing.
“There is something about this independent candidacy that is getting people to come out and listen. But you’re right, I’ve got to convince them, once they hear, that an independent can win, and that’s what the campaign’s about.”
 
You’ve rejected a lot of the conventional wisdom about independent campaigns and have argued that the vast majority of people are ready for that independent change. If that’s not the challenge you face, what do you view as the biggest challenges to your campaign?
“The size of the state.
“In Detroit, I did 250 house parties. I was in every neighborhood, sitting in living rooms. Now I’m going to a farm in Saginaw County, I’m in a house in Ottawa, I’m up at a bar in New Baltimore. I’m enjoying it, but it’s a bigger state. I’m going to have to spend a lot of time going to every corner of it. The challenge is just the physical geography of the state.
“The folks in New Baltimore, a whole crowd of people, and after an hour, somebody raises their hand and asks, ‘why isn’t everybody in this state going to vote for you?’ And if I have time to talk to them, I would win the vast majority of the state. But I need the time to talk.”
 
You mentioned Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has found exactly the right approach to dealing with President Donald Trump. You appeared at a number of Democratic campaign events in 2024, where we heard very dramatic rhetoric about the threat that he poses. Is there a mismatch between the rhetoric we heard on the campaign trail last year and this strategy now?
“That rhetoric didn’t come from me. And you can see the rhetoric didn’t work. Calling Trump a fascist was not a good campaign strategy. People wanted to know ‘what are you going to do?’
“I was mayor the first Trump term, I didn’t have any issues. We worked fine with the administration. I stayed out of the crossfire. I wasn’t one of the people who engaged in Twitter wars with the president to boost my Democratic status. It’s just not who I am.
“Ben Carson was the HUD Secretary under Trump. I had him to the house for dinner. He came from Detroit originally. I got funding for lead programs to take lead out of houses in Detroit in the first Trump administration.
“I’m the kind of person that says I don’t work for the Republicans or Democrats, I work for my residents in Detroit. Ultimately, I work for the people of Michigan. And I think Gretchen Whitmer has shown enormous courage in the last month. She knew she was going to take grief from the Democrats. But to save 5,000 jobs at Selfridge that she couldn’t get done under a Democratic president, it was remarkable what she accomplished.”
 
If you’re elected governor, would you have a PowerPoint for your State of the State?
“I’m not going to stand and read a teleprompter, I know that. I don’t know how to use a teleprompter. So yeah, I think you can assume it will be a PowerPoint. You’re the first person to ask me that. That’s funny.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0052-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:39:58.632206

“A year ago, I was ready to give up. Staff wouldn’t give up on me,” said one graduate, Rodney Davis. “I now have a life that has meaning,” including a supportive employer, a commercial driver’s license, and a future.
Drug court graduation is one of the most inspiring things I’ve witnessed in a courtroom. It also leaves me wanting more: more graduates, more success stories, more treatment programs across the state. Iowa could do much more to expand this alternative to prison.

Drug courts are reserved for defendants whose addictions lead to crime. They are at high risk of repeatedly stealing or committing other offenses to feed their habits.
Polk County created the state’s first adult criminal drug court in 1996, just seven years after the nation’s first drug court was established in Miami.
I attended my first drug court graduation in 1999. One of the graduates was a bear of a man who showed me a photo of his emaciated face when he was regularly using meth. He gushed about how the court had changed his life. It was the first time I’d ever seen a defendant hug a judge.
Such happy outcomes have been documented in multiple studies in Iowa and nationally. While results vary depending on many factors, graduates have lower rates of recidivism and substance use, and the treatment is far more cost-effective than incarceration, studies show.
An Iowa Department of Corrections study showed that every $1 spent on drug court returns a $9.61 benefit over a 10-year time frame.
Despite the results, funding has been inconsistent and depends on a mix of local support, state appropriations, and federal grants. “In general, Drug Courts have been left to their own means to fund and provide training to Drug Court Judges and staff, identify treatment providers, and otherwise enhance their programs,” according to a 2018 study of Iowa specialty courts by the National Center for State Courts.
Now that the Iowa Legislature has finally come up with a structure to spend opioid settlement money, expanding drug courts and other treatment programs should be on list of uses.
In Polk County, drug court graduations are held two or three times a year. Nine people is considered a large class; the graduation on June 13 occurred in the courtroom of the Drake Legal Clinic to accommodate the crowd.
Currently, 24 people are in the county’s drug court program, charged with crimes including theft, fraud, forgery, and burglary. Many more defendants qualify, if the program had more staff.
Drug court isn’t cheap, as it requires a judge, prosecutor, defense attorney, probation officer, coordinator, and support staff. But it’s generally a third of the cost, per participant, of prison.
The morning before the noon graduation on June 13, District Judge Jeffrey Ferrell presided over the regular routine of drug court. Defendants reported on their progress and gave updates on their work, community service, and treatment plans.
The reports went deeper than that, however, as the participants shared about larger issues they were confronting: past traumas, personality conflicts, relationship issues, and other root causes of their addictions.
The staff challenged the participants with some of the mantras of drug court:

“Own your mistakes.”
“All the truth, all the time.”
“Your worst day sober is better than your best day high.”

Later, participants listened to the graduates reinforce those lessons. The grads shared how they “learned to love myself” and “untangle the mess inside me.” They thanked their family, court officials, sponsors, therapists, and each other.
Graduate Jeremiah Bender summed up the goal: “Recovery isn’t just about staying clean, it’s about building a life worth living.”

To identify student work written by artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, many California colleges and universities rely on Turnitin, a plagiarism detection service. But the company’s tools aren’t always accurate, and when it falsely flags work done by humans as AI-generated, students are caught in the crossfire.
As CalMatters’ Tara García Mathewson explains, in 2025 California State University paid $163,000 to use Turnitin’s tool to identify AI-generated writing. Several University of California campuses spend more than $100,000 per year on the detector, while nearly three-quarters of California community colleges now use it. 
One of Turnitin’s biggest selling points is its robust repository of student writing, which it uses to train its detection tools. As of June 2025, the company reported having a database of 1.9 billion student papers. Turnitin licenses its technology to colleges under the requirement that the company gets to keep students’ writings in perpetuity.
Besides the privacy concerns that come with handing over students’ papers to a third party, tools marketed to identify AI-generated content also make mistakes. The Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, found that one in five students either were wrongly accused of using generative AI to cheat or knew someone who had been.
That’s what happened to Nilka Desiree Abbas in 2023. While taking a political science course at San Bernardino Valley College, Abbas received a zero on an assignment with a message from her professor saying she had used ChatGPT.

Abbas: “It took me so long to go back to school. To be falsely accused felt devastating.”

Though she ultimately passed the course, the incident rattled her: For her remaining classes, Abbas took photos as she worked on assignments for proof of her original work.

More on Turnitin: In reviewing purchasing records from 60 California institutions, Tara also found that Turnitin charged varying amounts for the same plagiarism-detection tools. In 2021, for example, UC Berkeley paid $2.11 per student for its Turnitin license, while UC Irvine’s Division of Continuing Education paid $6.50.

Budget negotiations continue

With less than a week before the fiscal year begins on July 1, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-controlled Legislature are inching closer to a budget agreement that seeks to plug the state’s $12 billion budget hole, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Both parties reached a tentative deal Tuesday, though negotiations are ongoing as lawmakers iron out the final details of the $321 billion spending plan. Newsom, for example, is calling for a provision that would speed up housing development near public transit, but the proposal is facing pushback in the state Senate.
The draft deal rejects some of Newsom’s proposed cuts, including reinstating a Medi-Cal asset limit that would have disqualified thousands of existing enrollees who are elderly or disabled. But it does retain some of Newsom’s other plans, such as freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for adults who do not have legal status. Legislators also successfully added one-time funding for the anti-crime measure Proposition 36.

Lawmakers, unions fight over construction wages

Speaking of the budget, a provision buried in the budget agreement could signal that lawmakers are nearing a deal that would set a new minimum wage rate for housing construction workers, report CalMatters’ Ben Christopher. 
If passed, the new rates would mark a turning point in a longstanding debate about “prevailing wages,” which has loomed over the legislative politics of California housing. These state-determined wages vary by occupation and location, and are generally comparable to union wages.
The proposal would carve out exceptions to California’s environmental laws to make it easier to construct certain housing projects, while putting forward a significantly lower, more developer-friendly alternative to the prevailing wage rate. Supporters of the deal say the new standards represent a wage increase since it applies to construction projects not currently covered by prevailing wages. 
But the influential State Building and Construction Trades Council slammed the proposal, calling it “harmful and unprecedented.” It argues that the arrangement would “devastate construction workers” by undercutting pay standards.

Ohio Republicans passed a $60 billion operating budget that includes tax cuts for the wealthy, funding for a new Cleveland Browns stadium, and restrictions on education. The GOP says it is a fiscally conservative and responsible budget. The Democrats say it is a budget for billionaires — not the working-class Ohioans.
In the dead of night, the Republicans on the Conference Committee approved a final budget. But while Ohioans were sleeping at 1 a.m. Wednesday morning — we were there. We only got the information less than an hour before the full Senate and House floor votes on Wednesday afternoon — the same as the Democrats. Even Republicans didn’t get the full language, many told us.




“Take care of all the major programs I think Ohioans expect us to do,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart (R-Ashville) said.




However, this was the first budget bill to not get a single Democratic vote since 2001.
“I cannot tell the people of Ohio that this is a budget that’s working for them,” The top Democrat on the Finance Committee, Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Westlake), said.
The final budget proposal ranges from changes to taxes, education, social services, health care and much more.
In the Senate, there was a 23-10 vote. Only state Sen. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) joined the Democrats to vote no.
In the House, it was 59-38. State Reps. Tim Barhorst (R-Fort Loramie), Levi Dean (R-Xenia), Ron Ferguson (R-Wintersville), Scott Oelslager (R-North Canton) and Michelle Teska (R-Clear Creek Township) joined the Democrats.
Income tax
They passed a 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
“We are making Ohio more competitive, more open for business,” Stewart said.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. This was made up by cutting social services and some tax exemptions. Sweeney said cuts came to public education.
Education
Public schools will face hundreds of millions of cuts from their expected budget, but the funding formula will stay intact for the most part.
“We’re underfunding our schools by at least a billion dollars,” Sweeney said.
Lawmakers would also be giving additional school funding to high-performing public school districts.
There is a cap on districts’ rainy day funds at 40% carryover from the previous revenue fund. This would mean that the schools would have to refund anything above that back to the taxpayer to provide property tax relief.
“We’re looking at more local control,” Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) said.
“How is it local control if we’re capping carryover at 40%?” I asked him.
“It’s the budget commission that is representing the people,” he responded, also adding that there are exceptions so that the districts can carry over more than 40%, as long as they are put in a capital fund instead of operating. However, schools are unable to move money back to the operating fund once they are in the capital.
The House wanted to cap the districts at 30% and the Senate 50%, which is why they settled in the middle.
If voters pass a school levy, the bill allows county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away, if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
The bill also eliminates levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it prohibits them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
It also prohibits a school district from submitting any current expense levy to voters if it has a general fund carry-over balance of more than 100% of general fund expenditures in the preceding fiscal year. It excludes renewal levies, though.
They kept the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, guaranteeing admission to a public university for each high school graduate in the top 10% of their graduating class. The students would also get $5,000 each year in financial aid.
However, the bill requires the student to sign a “statement of commitment” to stay in Ohio for three years after graduating.
They also give more than $30 million to five “intellectual diversity” centers at different public colleges across the state. These centers were created to combat what some consider liberal bias at universities.
The budget will provide about $2.5 billion over the biennium for the state’s voucher system — providing taxpayer dollars for students to attend nonpublic schools. This includes a new education savings account program, or ESAs, which is a way for families to get state money to purchase “educational goods and services,” including tuition at nonchartered, nonpublic schools.
This comes a day after a Franklin County court ruled Ohio’s EdChoice voucher program to be unconstitutional.
Property taxes
The restrictions on levies and carryover caps in the education budget are meant to give relief to property taxpayers. District cash carryovers have increased year-over-year from $3.6 billion to $10.5 billion since tracking began in 2012, the GOP reported.
The bill also allows the boards of county commissioners to provide up to a 2.5% owner-occupancy tax credit and a permissive homestead exemption for those who qualify.
Cleveland Browns
The Browns will be getting $600 million for their new Brook Park stadium. The budget calls for the state to take legal ownership of $1.7 billion in unclaimed funds, setting a clock on how long people have to file claims and get reunited with their missing money.
That’s a major change for Ohio, which currently holds unclaimed funds in perpetuity. The budget proposal would give people a decade to claim their money before it becomes the state’s property. Lawmakers want to grab $1.7 billion out of Ohio’s $4.8 billion pool of unclaimed funds right away – and then continue taking money on a rolling basis, after a decade of holding it.
A last-minute amendment to the compromise budget bill, released late Tuesday, would change a state law designed to make it harder for pro sports teams to leave publicly subsidized facilities, clearing a significant obstacle from the Browns’ road to Brook Park.
The new language says the so-called Modell law, designed to prevent major sports teams from pulling up stakes, would only come into play if a team chose to leave the state.
The proposed changes to the law are likely to end a court battle that’s just getting started and take leverage away from the City of Cleveland, which is fighting to keep the Browns on the lakefront or negotiate a better exit deal if the team leaves.
Pensions
First reported by us on Tuesday, state lawmakers chose to remove the majority of educators’ voices from the state’s retired teachers’ pension fund board.
Amid legislators’ concerns of an alleged corruption scheme threatening the fund, they have decided to reduce the number of elected positions and add more political appointments.
A provision in the bill would change the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers—five contributing and two retired—to three elected after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for actives and only one retiree seat. Each elected member will be able to finish their term, but once their term is out, four of the seven seats will not be refilled.
Those four removed educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members. Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
“The state legislature established these pension systems and has an ongoing responsibility to ensure the long-term health of the fund for retired and active teachers,” Provision Proposer State Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond) exclusively told me Tuesday. “The ongoing turmoil has clarified the need for the General Assembly to rebalance the Board composition.”
Health and child care
Numerous changes to Medicaid could put hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at risk of losing health insurance. The legislators also restricted access to Medicaid for babies.
The lawmakers funded a Child Care Choice program, which would provide millions for eligible families to cover child care services. There is also money going toward eyesight programs and families with children with disabilities.
The budget also cut DeWine’s proposed pediatric cancer research funding by half.
Miscellanous
Other provisions in the massive budget bill have nothing to do with spending, including:

Prohibiting SNAP for “sugar-sweetened beverages”
Requiring public libraries to place books related to sexual orientation or gender in an area away from the public
Adding more reporting requirements for abortion
Enshrining into state law that there are only two sexes
Stops funding for both youth homeless shelters and mental health services that support transgender or nonbinary identities
An ability to lock lost or stolen EBT cards

“At the end of the day, we have to remember that budgets are about choices,” Sweeney said. “We were elected to make choices for the people of Ohio, and we believe that this budget is making the wrong choices.”
Next steps
Since both the House and the Senate passed the bill, it will be sent to the governor’s desk. DeWine will decide which provisions to line-item veto.
Line-item vetoing is the ability for the governor to pick and choose which policies within a larger piece of legislation get to stay or must go.
In the past operating budget, he issued about 40.
We will continue breaking down what is in the 6,000-page bill in the coming days.

That was the main message Wednesday for an online presentation featuring top executives from four organizations that have membership straddling the border. The presentation came just days before the teams face a deadline from Kansas on its proposal to build new stadiums for both teams.
“We get this question a lot,” said Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. “Does the regional business and civic community have a preference for which side of the state line or which specific location the teams land? No. As long as the teams land within the KC region, we’re going to support their decision, full stop.”
The presentation focused on how Kansas City competes with other metro areas. At no point during the debates in Kansas or Missouri over public financing for stadiums has either team said it was considering moving out of the region.
Such a move would require the concurrence of other team owners. No city or state other than Missouri and Kansas have made public overtures to the teams.
The sentiment that the state line was the smallest consideration for Kansas City businesses was echoed by the other participants, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, which hosted the presentation, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City and the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation.
“The more that we can stand united as one KC, and understand that our competition are those other regions that want the assets we have or are competing to attract what we want to get as well, I think we’re going to be stronger and we’re going to win,” said Joe Reardon, CEO of the Kansas City chamber.
Missouri lawmakers this month approved a plan to finance up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, committing almost $1.5 billion in future tax revenue. The current facilities, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, were opened in the early 1970s and almost all other stadiums built near that time are no longer in use, Reardon noted in the presentation.
Kansas, under a plan approved last year by the Kansas Legislature, is offering to pay up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums if the teams cross the state border.
During the debates in both states, the focus was on winning the “border war”.
For Missouri, the loss of either team would mean another major league team leaving the state. St. Louis lost the NFL’s Rams in 2015, the football Cardinals in 1987 and the NBA’s Hawks in 1968. Kansas City lost Major League Baseball’s Athletics in 1967 and the Kings NBA franchise in 1985.
Kansas City is the smallest market that has both an NFL team and a Major League Baseball team.
For Kansas, it would be the first time a team from the NFL or Major League Baseball called the state its home.
“Our competition is not in Missouri or Kansas, it’s outside the region,” Cowden said. “We need to keep them at bay at arm’s length. This is not, in our opinion, about a border war. It truly is about a border solution.”
The success of Kansas City sports teams, especially the Chiefs, has raised the national and international profile of the region, said Kathy Nelson of the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation and Visit KC.
“They are opening doors to businesses like we never heard,” she said.
The Chiefs have played in five of the six most recent Super Bowls. The 2025 game had a national audience of 127 million and international audience estimated at 62 million. The romance between Taylor Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has also boosted the city’s profile, she said.
The Royals made the playoffs last year for the first time since winning the World Series in 2015. They have a more regional audience, she said, with 80% of game attendees living within 75 miles of downtown Kansas City.
“Nothing else puts us on a global stage like our sports teams,” Nelson said. “There’s nothing else like this.”

,California,2025-06-26 12:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,California colleges spend millions to catch plagiarism and AI. Is the faulty tech worth it?,Tara García Mathewson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/ai-detector/,Colleges and universities renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year even though its flawed detectors are expensive and require students to let the company keep their papers forever.,"In summary
Colleges and universities renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year even though its flawed detectors are expensive and require students to let the company keep their papers forever.


It has been more than two years since the release of ChatGPT created widespread dismay over generative AI’s threat to academic integrity. Why would students write anything themselves, instructors wondered, if a chatbot could do it for them? Indeed, many students have taken the bait, if not to write entire essays, then certainly to draft an outline, refine their ideas or clean up their writing before submitting it.
And as faculty members grapple with what this means for grading, tech companies have proved yet again that there’s money to be made from panic. Turnitin, a longtime leader in the plagiarism-detection market, released a new tool within six months of ChatGPT’s debut to identify AI-generated writing in students’ assignments. In 2025 alone, records show the California State University system collectively paid an extra $163,000 for it, pushing total spending this year to over $1.1 million. Most of these campuses have licensed Turnitin’s plagiarism detector since 2014.
That detector first became popular among professors when the internet made it easy for students to copy and paste information from websites into their assignments. In the AI detector, faculty members sought both a way to discourage students from using ChatGPT on their homework and a way to identify the AI-generated writing when they saw it.  
But the technology offers only a shadow of accurate detection: It highlights any matching text, whether properly cited or not; it flags everything that mirrors AI’s writing style, whether a student used AI inappropriately or not. And Turnitin licenses this technology to colleges while demanding “perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable and sublicensable” rights to student writing. The company has used these rights to build a massive database of student papers, which it uses to market the superiority of its existing products as well as build new ones, including the AI detector. Turnitin has become so valuable that in 2019 Advance Publications paid $1.75 billion to acquire it, more than the total amount raised by all ed-tech startups the prior year, EdSurge noted at the time.
To understand the full range of consequences stemming from Turnitin’s place in higher education, CalMatters and The Markup interviewed dozens of students, faculty members and administrators across the state and obtained Turnitin purchase orders documenting the amount paid over time by approximately 60 colleges there. This investigation revealed institutions willing to renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year despite the cost, faulty technology and concerns about privacy and intellectual property raised by the company’s ever-expanding database of papers.
Turnitin tries to make the gray area of academic dishonesty into something black-and-white, and many faculty members drive demand, searching for the promise of algorithmic accuracy. But honest students are caught in the crossfire of an arms race between technology that mimics human speech and technology that claims to identify it.
The rise of Turnitin
In 2004 Wendy Brill-Wynkoop, a photography professor at College of the Canyons, chaired her campus’s technology committee. She became one of the first Turnitin users at the large community college north of Los Angeles, testing out the software before campuswide adoption. Purchasing records obtained by CalMatters and The Markup show Brill-Wynkoop’s license cost just $120 in 2004. The following year, College of the Canyons paid 75 cents per student and less than $6,500 total to make the tool available to all faculty members for as many papers as they wanted to scan. This year, the college paid almost $47,000.
As teaching and learning increasingly shifted online throughout the early 2000s and 2010s, Turnitin became more embedded in classes. College of the Canyons, like many institutions, paid extra to integrate the plagiarism checker into its online learning management system, where faculty members had begun to post assignments and reading materials and students were expected to submit their papers. Turnitin’s default settings, once integrated, are to scan every assignment, not just those that professors suspect are plagiarized. Besides accelerating the growth of the company’s student-paper database, this puts the tool in front of faculty members who otherwise wouldn’t have used it.

In fact, Brill-Wynkoop had largely stopped using Turnitin to check student work after a few years. “If I had a student who I suspected wasn’t using their own words, I’d pop the phrase into Google and then could just show them,” she said. “I wouldn’t have gone back to [Turnitin].” But since her college built it into the system she was already using to read student papers, she found herself checking the automated reports again.
When the pandemic shut down in-person instruction on campuses nationwide in 2020, fresh anxiety over academic integrity created another windfall for Turnitin. The GovSpend database of government-purchasing records shows a nationwide spike in Turnitin contracts during the 2020-21 school year. And in California, at least, many colleges processed more cheating accusations that year, too, according to academic dishonesty case counts obtained by The Markup and CalMatters via public-records requests. Those case counts dropped — sometimes precipitously — with the return to in-person learning but climbed again when the release of ChatGPT gave Turnitin its next crisis to monetize.
This year’s $47,000 contract with Turnitin for plagiarism and AI detection pushed the total spent by College of the Canyons to over half a million dollars.
Turnitin executives did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Worldwide, the company licenses its software to more than 16,000 institutions that cumulatively enroll over 71 million students. Almost three-quarters of California community colleges now use it, as does the entire California State University system, except Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Cal Poly canceled its contract last year saying not enough faculty used Turnitin to justify the cost, but not before it spent $171,000 on the detectors from 2020 to 2024. Cal State campuses have spent a combined $6 million on Turnitin since 2019 alone, according to records obtained by CalMatters and The Markup. Several University of California campuses spend more than $100,000 per year on the detector, which Turnitin licenses for a per-student fee.
As part of this investigation, CalMatters and The Markup tracked down more than $15 million in purchases of Turnitin plagiarism-prevention software across 57 institutions. Of course, since California is home to 149 public colleges and universities, this amount represents just a fraction of the total spending statewide. And while College of the Canyons released 21 years of receipts, most campuses shared only three to seven.

Robbie Torney is the senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, a national nonprofit headquartered in San Francisco that does research and advocacy work around how young people use technology. He said $15 million is a lot of money to spend on a tool with such limited value. He pointed to troubling reports of Turnitin erroneously flagging student writing as AI-generated and equally troubling accounts of students using simple workarounds to undermine the AI detectors.
“It’s probably better to invest in training for professors and teachers,” Torney said, “and also creating some frameworks for universities to message to students how they can and can’t use AI, rather than trying to use a surveillance methodology to detect AI in student writing.”
Yet many faculty members still want the tool, and colleges have continued paying for it year after year. Records show the Los Rios Community College District, in the Sacramento area, has paid almost $750,000 since 2018 to license Turnitin’s antiplagiarism software. In the Los Angeles Community College District, this year’s license alone cost $265,000. And UC Berkeley is just a few years into a 10-year, nearly $1.2-million contract of its own.
Amassing student papers
Turnitin helps convince college leaders to buy its tools by arguing it knows student writing better than any other company in the world. It has been making this case for decades by pointing to the size of its database, regularly updating its website with the latest student-paper count — 1.9 billion as of June 2025.
Brill-Wynkoop heard the same pitch back in the early 2000s: Instructors could catch a student turning in a peer’s paper from a previous semester with Turnitin. But the company doesn’t need to keep papers for decades to accomplish this.
The Community College League of California signed an agreement in 2016 with a company called VeriCite, locking in pricing for any of the state’s 116 community colleges that wanted its plagiarism-prevention software. VeriCite also claimed to help colleges catch students turning in their peers’ papers. But the tool only made student papers searchable to faculty members on campuses covered by the contract, and it gave them a chance to opt out of letting VeriCite pool their students’ work. The company claimed no rights to student intellectual property or copyright over their work.
After Turnitin bought the company in 2018, a new set of terms and conditions took effect: Now student papers go into Turnitin’s global database and the company maintains a perpetual, royalty-free license over all of them.
When Turnitin acquired another plagiarism-detection company, Unicheck, in 2020, the El Camino College student newspaper reported that the institution switched vendors rather than put up with Turnitin’s contract terms. Still, the vast majority of colleges and universities across California continue to hand over student writing to Turnitin in the name of plagiarism prevention.

Jesse Stommel, an associate professor at the University of Denver, started speaking out about the company’s database of student papers in 2011, when he discovered his dissertation was in it. As a writing instructor, he takes issue with schools unquestioningly handing over original student work to a for-profit company.
In his syllabus, where the university requires him to include a statement about Turnitin, Stommel tells students, “It is my commitment to you that I will not submit any of your work to Turnitin. Plagiarism-detection software like Turnitin monetizes student intellectual property and contributes to a culture of suspicion in education. I trust you. I trust that your work is your own.” He then encourages students to ask him if they have questions about how to properly cite sources and directs them to an essay he co-wrote if they want to learn more about Turnitin or how to protect their intellectual property.
Students have protested Turnitin use too. An undergrad at McGill University, in Canada, failed multiple assignments in 2003 after refusing to submit them to Turnitin. He appealed to the university administration, ultimately winning the right to have his papers graded without the technology.
In 2007, high schoolers in Virginia and Arizona sued iParadigms, Turnitin’s parent company at the time, arguing that its database violated their copyright over their own writing. The courts disagreed. The students also lost on appeal, but some colleges still warn their faculty against using free online plagiarism checkers because of privacy concerns inherent in handing student work over to third-party companies.
Turnitin says it doesn’t “monetize” student writing, per se, but it has raised its prices since releasing an AI detector, which the company developed using that writing.
Brill-Wynkoop said she and her colleagues never thought that the student-paper database could one day become a source of profit for Turnitin. “That makes me feel bad as a faculty member, that I encouraged my students to use something, and now, I don’t know,” she said. “None of us thought about big data and how it would be used in the future.”
‘Caught in the middle’
For today’s undergraduates, routine surveillance and violations of privacy are an unavoidable part of college life. Emily Ibarra, who just finished her second year at Cal State Northridge, said she has never even used ChatGPT. Yet, like all students on her campus and many millions more across the country, she has to deal with the consequences of widespread suspicion about her generation’s integrity.
“That culture is getting normalized here, of professors being able to take the furthest lengths possible to make sure [students aren’t cheating],” she said. “It kind of makes you feel defeated before you even start.” 
When Ibarra started college, she panicked at the sight of her first Turnitin “similarity report.” Some faculty members let students see the reports as soon as they turn in their assignments, while others show students the reports only if they want to discuss a problem.

“At first I didn’t know what it was,” Ibarra said. “It shows green, yellow, red, so at first I thought it was grading the quality of my writing.” On a short assignment, she said, it’s almost impossible to avoid a “yellow” report because Turnitin’s text-matching scanners will flag quoted material and suggest it could be plagiarized. So far, none of Ibarra’s professors have accused her of academic dishonesty, but the risk, she said — even if she doesn’t intentionally plagiarize or use ChatGPT — is “really stressful.”
Ibarra has a tool called Grammarly installed on her computer that she has been using since high school to catch spelling and grammar mistakes; only now, she said, some professors at Cal State Northridge tell students not to even use spell-check tools because they’re bolstered by AI. Microsoft Word, Google Docs and Grammarly now all rely on the same algorithms that create ChatGPT’s human-sounding responses to suggest improvements to users’ writing. Ibarra says she uses Grammarly only to correct misspellings and missed commas, but, like other students interviewed for this story, she isn’t always sure when appropriate use of ubiquitous technology veers into academic dishonesty.
Joshua Hurst, who just finished his junior year at Cal State Northridge, said Turnitin flagged his writing in the spring of 2024. He hadn’t used ChatGPT to craft the assignment, but he had used Grammarly to clean up his writing before turning it in. His professor didn’t dock his grade, but Hurst knows other professors might have. Now he runs his writing through two different checkers before submitting anything.
Hurst is excited about AI-driven innovation and is glad to be part of a generation that gets to experience it, but the lack of consensus over acceptable AI use and the threats posed by faulty detectors make him shake his head.
“Students,” he said, “are the ones who are caught in the middle.”
The Center for Democracy & Technology, a D.C.-based nonprofit focused on research and advocacy around digital rights, surveyed high schoolers about their experiences with a range of educational technologies last summer. At the request of The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, researchers asked students whether they or anyone they know had been wrongly accused of using generative AI to cheat. One in five said yes.
When Common Sense Media surveyed a nationally representative group of teenagers about their AI use last year, it found that Black teens were twice as likely as white and Latino teens to say their teachers had flagged their work as AI-generated when it wasn’t. In their report about the survey, researchers attributed this difference, in part, to teachers’ bias. Black students have long been disciplined at far higher rates than their peers. 
Other researchers have pointed to the vulnerability of non-native English speakers subjected to these detectors because their writing is likely to use simpler syntax and a more limited vocabulary, which happens to be typical of AI-generated writing.
Nilka Desiree Abbas suspects that’s why she was accused in the summer of 2023. A native Spanish speaker, she was taking a political science course at San Bernardino Valley College and got a zero on an assignment along with a curt message from her professor saying she had used ChatGPT. But Abbas, who is from Puerto Rico, said she hadn’t.
“It took me so long to go back to school,” she said with a toddler at her side. “To be falsely accused felt devastating.” She ultimately passed the class with a B and graduated with a degree in administration of justice the following spring, but she was shaken. She took photos of her progress on assignments in her remaining courses to create an evidence trail of original work.
Turnitin has since fine-tuned its detector to avoid accusing non-native English speakers more often than native English speakers, but it acknowledges its detector still gets it wrong sometimes. And stories like Abbas’s have saturated Reddit communities and TikTok feeds, creating anxiety even among students who don’t think they cross any academic integrity lines while completing their assignments.
CalMatters and The Markup spoke with more than a dozen current undergrads, and virtually all of them described strategies to reduce the likelihood of being wrongly accused. A freshman said she adds typos to her writing to distinguish it from AI’s. Many students said they check their papers with Turnitin before submitting them, when professors allow it, and with additional online detectors for good measure. This step has become a form of due diligence for students, most of whom describe at least some level of concern that they could be accused without having done anything wrong.
Jasmine Ruys, who oversees student conduct cases at College of the Canyons, said she often sees students who think they were wrongly accused but unwittingly used AI.
“There are students who go to other colleges where that college purchases Grammarly, the pro version, installs it on their computers to help them and when they turn it in to our instructors, it gets caught by the AI detector,” Ruys said. “It’s hard because students think they’re doing the right thing and they’re getting caught up in it because [AI] is just embedded in everything.”
The illusion of a solution
Turnitin’s original text-matching software wasn’t especially sophisticated at detecting actual plagiarism, but at least it could point to the original source behind its accusations, and a faculty member had something to assess; they could ignore the text Turnitin highlighted because students were quoting reading material or citing an appropriate source. The AI detector determines what portion of an assignment was probably generated by AI but leaves it to faculty members to puzzle through whether that AI-like text represents a violation of academic integrity.
Adam Kaiserman has taught English at College of the Canyons for more than a decade. Unlike some of his colleagues who forgo Turnitin’s technology, he looks closely at the software’s similarity reports. And while he said he plans to keep using the tool, he didn’t describe it as very helpful. Student habits have shifted. Both Kaiserman and Ruys said they almost never see traditional plagiarism in Turnitin’s text matches anymore; students who are inclined to cut corners will just use AI chatbots instead. And the software misses much of the AI-generated writing it scans, in part because Turnitin has become more conservative about what it flags to avoid accusing honest students. The software also doesn’t scan for content accuracy, leaving a key tell of AI writing undetected.

“The biggest tipoff [of AI use] are fake quotes or hallucinations, which Turnitin isn’t good at catching,” Kaiserman said. When a paper mentions a person who doesn’t exist or a quote that never appeared in the reading, what many refer to as “hallucinations,” Turnitin has no idea. It just measures how much the writing mirrors the style of AI-written text.
While many students are as honest as ever, plenty have started to use AI. They describe using ChatGPT on assignments they don’t care about, reserving their full effort for papers they see as a higher priority. Sometimes they outsource deeper thinking and planning to AI when they are stumped by a blank page and want help with how to write an introduction or structure a paper. In the Common Sense Media survey, 63% of teens said they had used a chatbot or text generator for school assignments.
Now, many colleges make chatbots available to students for free, driving even wider use. A survey of undergraduates in the United Kingdom this past December found 88% had used AI on assignments, mostly to explain concepts, summarize content and suggest research ideas, but 18% of those surveyed said they had submitted work that included some AI-generated text.
At College of the Canyons, Ruys has found that when students do use a chatbot to complete a paper, it’s usually because they had too much on their plate with school, they were preoccupied with work or family commitments or they didn’t understand the assignment. Instead of going to their professors, they went to AI. During academic-dishonesty hearings, she guides students to campus resources that can help them better manage their workloads. But she considers a lot of AI use to be in an ethical gray area, including when students write a first draft themselves and then polish it with an AI tool.
“Isn’t that very similar to our tutors?” Ruys mused.
Administrators from the California State University Office of the Chancellor, Cal State Northridge and the Los Angeles Community College District, all of whom occasionally teach, said they don’t use Turnitin in their own courses, even if they defend their institutions’ software licenses more broadly. Stanford University doesn’t license the technology at all, advising its faculty that the tools can erode feelings of trust and belonging among students and raise questions about their privacy and intellectual-property rights. 
Stommel, the University of Denver professor, said faculty members often believe cheating is on the rise and that detectors are one of the only ways to keep students honest. But he shares evidence that cheating rates have long remained largely flat, even post-ChatGPT. He also pans the use of Turnitin as a scare tactic. “We see this with the criminal-justice system,” he said. “Deterrence doesn’t actually work.” What does work, he argues, is building trusting relationships with students. “Turnitin immediately fractures that relationship with students.”
Sean Michael Morris, a frequent co-author of Stommel’s and a longtime educator, also tries to convince faculty members they don’t need Turnitin despite the company’s marketing, which champions its value to academic integrity.
“Ed tech does a good job of convincing you that it is huge, permanent, there, 100% necessary for education,” he said. “That’s its big lie.”

,California,2025-06-26 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Congress is fighting over this tax deduction. Here’s how it affects Californians,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/06/salt-deduction-taxes-california/,"The House wants to raise the SALT deduction cap, which would help wealthy Californians pay less in federal taxes. The Senate wants to keep it where it is.","In summary
The House wants to raise the SALT deduction cap, which would help wealthy Californians pay less in federal taxes. The Senate wants to keep it where it is.


A provision in the Republicans’ tax and spending bill will help determine a limit on what high-income Californians can deduct on their taxes, but Congress disagrees on how much. 
After the passage of the 2017 tax bill during President Donald Trump’s first term, California taxpayers who itemize deductions saw their ability to deduct their full state and local income taxes and property taxes go away — to help the federal government pay for corporate tax cuts. The new cap that was established, $10,000, expires at the end of this year.   
Now the tax bill in the U.S. House of Representatives proposes raising the deduction’s cap to $40,000, though the U.S. Senate bill would keep the cap where it is. 
The debate over raising the so-called SALT (state and local taxes) deduction cap has been contentious. A higher cap would benefit high-income people who many experts say don’t need another tax break. But another part of the proposal would get rid of a workaround that individuals and small business owners have been using to reduce their personal income tax. 
Nikhita Airi, a research associate in the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, wrote in an analysis that raising the cap “would be expensive and deliver little benefit to most taxpayers.” Nationally, about 10% of taxpayers who itemize use the state and local tax deduction, she told CalMatters.
That number is higher In California, where about 2.8 million taxpayers, or 15% of those who filed taxes in the state, claimed the deduction in 2022, according to the most recent data available from the IRS. The highest percentage of those who used the deductions were in some of the wealthiest parts of the state, such as Marin, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, according to Airi’s analysis.  
While some experts agree with the sentiment that raising the cap would benefit mostly wealthy taxpayers, it would actually help “the working rich” in high-cost California, said Dennis Ventry, a professor at UC Davis School of Law who focuses on tax policy.
Ventry was referring to people whose annual income is between $250,000 and right under $500,000, who are likely to itemize their deductions. 
For example, raising the cap could mean California residents could deduct the full cost of their property taxes, he said. The median price of a home in the state is $900,000. Although it varies by county, the property tax for such a home would be about $9,000 annually. Raising the deduction cap would allow many homeowners to deduct their property taxes as well as other state and local taxes.
“That’s a big deal,” Ventry said. “Or it pays for your child care so your spouse can re-enter the workforce.”
The House proposal would allow the increased cap to apply to those with annual incomes of $500,000 or less. Taxpayers who make more would be subject to the $10,000 cap.
More than 20 California Democrats in the House, led by U.S. Reps. Dave Min of Costa Mesa, Zoe Lofgren of San Jose and Mike Thompson of Napa, actually pushed for no cap on the deduction. They wrote in a May letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith that the state’s taxpayers “pay more than their fair share of taxes to our nation and deserve tax relief in these difficult economic times.” 
Rep. Young Kim of Anaheim, a Republican member of Congress, was pushing for a $62,000 deduction limit, advocating for a higher cap along with her colleagues from other high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey. Kim represents parts of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where almost half of homes are worth more than $1 million.
It’s no surprise that the Senate kept the cap at $10,000. “There is no Republican senator from a high-tax state,” said Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at UC Berkeley. “If the Senate had a choice, it would not include this provision.”
Another part of the proposed tax bills would partly get rid of workarounds that certain taxpayers have been using: By paying state taxes through a business entity, owners can effectively bypass the federal deduction cap and count the payments toward their personal state income taxes.
Without the workaround, individuals and small businesses with incomes under $500,000 — such as doctors with private practices or lawyers or financial professionals with their own firms — could be subject to whatever deduction cap Congress eventually agrees on. But, as authors of an analysis by the Tax Law Center at the New York University School of Law wrote, the House bill included exceptions to shutting down the workaround, depending on the types of taxes being paid. 
Darien Shanske, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law who focuses on state and local taxation, said that the discussion about these tax proposals can “make it hard to give a straight answer… it clearly skews toward wealthier people.”
In the case of getting rid of the cap workaround, for example, Shanske said it would be more palatable if, say, “they were doing it to fund universal pre-K.” But he said “this is being done to retain low taxes on [big] corporations. You’re increasing taxes on smaller businesses. That’s problematic.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/040123-Tax-File-Preparation-PU-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

Their unions are fighting substitutes,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/california-court-reporter-shortage/,A shortage of court reporters is leaving many Califonians with no way to appeal their cases in the justice system. Will a new union-backed bill solve the problem or make it worse?,"In summary
A shortage of court reporters is leaving many Califonians with no way to appeal their cases in the justice system. Will a new union-backed bill solve the problem or make it worse?


Ashley Paschen believed she had a strong case as she sought a restraining order against her ex-husband.
She alleges she had proof he hurt her, and she had “nanny camera” footage that she alleges showed him beating her stepson. But a San Diego County court commissioner refused to admit the video footage as evidence and ruled that her abuse claims weren’t credible. 
She wanted to appeal the decision, but no attorney would represent her because no one transcribed her court hearings. Court reporters simply weren’t available for all of her court dates. Without a written record “it makes it virtually impossible to win an appeal,” one attorney told her.
It’s a common occurrence in California. Since 2023, more than 1.7 million family law, restraining order, probate and other civil proceedings have had no written transcriptions, according to the Judicial Branch of California. 
That’s because there’s a statewide shortage of certified court reporters. When no reporters are available, state law, with a few exceptions, bans recording in courtrooms, even though many courts have recording devices. Having a recording would give parties in a legal dispute the option of later having a hearing transcribed by a certified professional. 
“It’s absolutely outraging (if) it’s that easy to, you know, flip a switch and be able to record,”  Paschen said. 
Nonprofit legal aid groups filed a petition late last year urging the California Supreme Court to overturn a ban on recording cases such as Paschen’s.
The petitioners argue that Californians’ constitutional rights to appeal are being violated, and the ban on recording in courtrooms creates a “two-tiered” system of justice. Wealthy litigants, the petitioners say, have the option of hiring private court reporters to sit in on their hearings and type up a written record. But people who can’t afford the more than $3,000 a day to hire a contract reporter are at the mercy of an understaffed court system.
Most states and the federal courts use recording technology more than California does, some exclusively in lieu of court reporters. Only Texas and New York restrict the technology to the extent California does, according to the Judicial Council of California.
Now, with the state Supreme Court’s ruling pending, the unions representing court reporters have urged the court to uphold the recording  ban. At the same time, the union is pushing for legislation that will temporarily allow recording in cases like Paschen’s. If it passes, it could conflict with the court’s decision.
And critics say the union’s bill might make the problem worse.
Influential SEIU pushes for bill
San Mateo Democratic Assemblymember Diane Papan’s Assembly Bill 882 would lift the ban on recording in civil cases for three years to give the courts time to hire more reporters and ease the shortage.
“This bill is about access to justice,” Papan told her colleagues on the Assembly floor early this month. “It will ensure that a record of civil proceedings is available when a litigant cannot afford to hire a court reporter.” 
Papan didn’t return interview requests; neither did a lobbying representative for the most influential labor organization behind the bill, Service Employees International Union. SEIU has donated at least $62,300 to Papan since 2021, according to the CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
Critics say unions put so many restrictions into Papan’s measure that it doesn’t go nearly far enough to solve the problem – and could even make it harder to turn on a recorder inside a courtroom. 
The proposal would require parties in a case who cannot afford to retain a private court reporter to request in writing a recording at least a day before a hearing, an option that those without an attorney are unlikely to know about. 
Court reporters also could turn down an assignment in another courtroom, even if it’s in the same building. For instance, a court reporter stationed in a family courtroom would not be required to cover a felony criminal trial, even if the lack of a court reporter would cause the case to be dismissed.

Earlier versions of the bill, which easily passed the Assembly this month, had more restrictions, including prohibiting courts from buying or leasing recording equipment.
Unions that represent court reporters that got the ban on court recording passed in the first place have fought previous legislative efforts to expand use of the technology. In 2023, the unions succeeded in killing the bill which would have allowed recording in all civil proceedings. 
Had it passed, the legal aid groups wouldn’t have needed to ask the California Supreme Court to decide the matter. In a brief opposing the pending Supreme Court case, SEIU and other court reporter unions argued the Supreme Court wasn’t the appropriate venue and that the Legislature and trial courts are working to solve the problem.
The court reporter dispute is the latest example of the political power labor unions wield in the Legislature. 
As CalMatters has reported, organized labor, which represents around one-sixth of the state’s workforce, regularly gets its way on bills at higher rates than other prolific lobbying groups, due in part to the massive political spending by unions. 
SEIU is one of the most politically influential unions. Since 2015, SEIU and its affiliates have donated at least $20.6 million to members of the Legislature, according to the Digital Democracy database.
“The union representing court reporters has been a particularly effective union in protecting their interests,” said Clark Kelso, a professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law.
Despite good pay, positions go unfilled
Court reporters argue that because they guarantee that their transcriptions are 100% accurate, they’re the only method of ensuring no one loses a case because something said during a hearing is written down wrong.
Court reporters can ask a witness to speak up, slow down or repeat their words if they’re hard to understand. Without human beings doing that, transcriptions can end up incomplete or inaccurate, the bill’s proponents say. 
“The state of California demands justice be fair and accurate,” Stacy Gaskill, a court reporter from San Mateo County, told the Assembly Judiciary Committee in April. “That can only be met if court records are verbatim and complete.” She said court reporters are held to such high standards they can be charged with a crime for certifying inaccurate transcripts.  
While most agree that human court reporters are the gold standard, those pushing for expanded recording in courtrooms argue that there aren’t enough new court reporters to offset the number of retiring workers – a problem causing ripple effects throughout the judicial system. Around 4,600 court reporters are licensed in California, most of them not court employees. That’s down from 7,500 in 2010. Around half of them were eligible for retirement in 2023, according to the last available statistic from the judicial branch.

The most serious cases, such as felony criminal proceedings, get priority for a court reporter, leaving other hearings without a written record on busy days. Almost all of California’s major civil cases go without one; more than half of all family law and probate cases have no reporter present, according to the judicial branch.
“The inability to create a verbatim record limits people’s ability to appeal significant and life-changing decisions regarding child custody, paternity, conservatorship assets, and more,” the judicial branch says on its website.
Legal organizations that filed the petition with the Supreme Court say it’s often not known whether reporters are available until the day of the hearing. This forces attorneys and their clients to decide to delay their cases or risk that they won’t need a written record during an appeal.
“Even when a continuance is a viable choice, it may be repeated, dragging out proceedings for many months or even years,” the aid group, BayLegal, wrote in the petition.
The shortage comes despite the Legislature’s approval of $30 million to lure new hires for the well-paying job. 
The median pay with benefits for a court reporter in California is more than $200,000, according to the judicial branch. Plus, by law, transcripts of hearings must be purchased from court reporters who get to keep the money. During the last fiscal year, California courts spent $23.7 million paying court reporters for transcripts, according to the judicial branch. 
But even with the job’s financial perks, courts are struggling to hire. Los Angeles Superior Court is offering a $50,000 signing bonus and $25,000 finder’s fee for court employees who refer a court reporter. Despite the incentives, L.A. County has 106 vacant court reporter positions, according to an online dashboard the superior court created to highlight the problem.
Hiring has stepped up statewide, but courts still need an estimated 428 new full-time court reporters to catch up, according to a statewide dashboard.  
Could AI replace court reporters?
It’s hardly surprising that courts are struggling to find enough reporters, said Lorin Kline, director of advocacy for the Legal Aid Association of California, one of the groups pushing for expanding the use of recordings in courtrooms.

Kline said court reporters are likely to make more money working as private contractors, and younger applicants may recognize that artificial intelligence transcription technology could replace their jobs in a few years. 
“Not only is it a profession with potentially a questionable future because of technology,” Kline said, “working in the court itself isn’t necessarily the first job that a court reporter wants to get because they can make more money working elsewhere.”
Neither the petition before the Supreme Court nor the bill to temporarily allow more recordings refer to AI transcription software. For now and the immediate future, to appeal a case, a transcript from a recorded hearing must be prepared by a pro. 
Some experts say AI is not the answer to the court reporter shortage — and will never be.
“Humans just do language imperfectly all the time and in unpredictable ways… and they make mistakes,” said Nicole Holliday, an associate professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley.  “But here’s where they have the edge over any automated system: They can pause and ask for clarifications. They can improve their training.”
She said AI transcription systems have been trained to transcribe speech based on how English is spoken by a subset of the population that’s typically white and wealthy. The software is not even close to accurate for the diverse accents spoken in America today, Holliday said.
Others see promise as the technology improves and if it’s deployed responsibly, including Camille Crittenden, executive director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute.
She called the technology “potentially transformative for the judicial system,” giving poor people the same access to justice while achieving “all kinds of cost savings.”
“I know that the union doesn’t want to hear that,” she said. “But for the courts overall, that would seem like a positive outcome.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10092023_CARE-Court_AH_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420
,California,2025-06-26 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Much of LA’s  community of immigrants is hiding, leaving a hole in the fabric of the city",Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/los-angeles-undocumented-immigrants/,"Los Angeles’ large, productive, and now very afraid community of undocumented immigrants has slipped into the shadows. Here's how it hurts us all.","In immigrant-rich Westlake in Los Angeles, stores were empty Friday morning. The computer repair place was closed. 
Gates were down in front of a check-cashing operation. One of the area health clinics, where residents often line up for medical care, was open but without takers.
A block away, MacArthur Park still stirred with drug addicts and unhoused men. Police arrested two, cuffing them as the men stared into the distance. 
Around Los Angeles, flower sellers who congregate outside Forest Lawn were missing, buses were running half empty, car washes were closed. Parking lots at Home Depots and garden stores were suddenly noticeably vacant.
This is what happens when the federal government, against the wishes of those who live in a community, exercises its distant authority and imposes a solution Los Angeles residents don’t want. Confrontations in a small area of downtown escalated after the arrival of the National Guard and then of active-duty U.S. Marines. 
And Los Angeles’ large, productive, and now very afraid community of undocumented immigrants has slipped into the shadows. 
There are many misconceptions about immigrants in Los Angeles, but none more disorienting than the canard — so popular among Trump administration representatives — that those immigrants who arrived without papers somehow live apart from the rest of the city.
The role of these immigrants in the local economy is widely misunderstood and deliberately misrepresented. Undocumented immigrants do not work outside the larger economy; they are integrated into it, just as they are into every other aspect of life in California. 
When they are removed or are cowered into staying home, the effects touch everyone.
“The impact on the economy is broader,” said Saba Waheed, director of UCLA’s Labor Center. “They (federal authorities) are uprooting and interfering in the daily life of Los Angeles.
“You’re taking away part of our workforce. That is hurting LA more broadly.”
That’s in part because of the close integration of illegal immigrants into the broader economy, and not just in Los Angeles. In California, undocumented workers make up about a quarter of all farm laborers and construction workers.
When Arizona adopted anti-immigrant laws in the early 2000s, many undocumented residents, perhaps as many as 40%, left. The economy suffered. And unemployment for low-skilled white men increased, not decreased.
That makes perfect sense to all but the closed-minded or hard-hearted.

Whether here legally or illegally, these are working men and women. When they get paid, they spend that money on clothes and places to live, toys for their children, food and the stuff of life. That spending goes into the broader economy, supporting businesses that are owned and operated by legal residents. 
Restaurants and stores that depend on business from those in the country illegally suffer right along with those immigrants.
Trump supporters, starting with the president’s shrill emissary, Stephen Miller, like to counter with crocodile tears for illegal immigrants, who they suggest are an exploited class of workers, while simultaneously calling them an ominous criminal threat. 
And though it is certainly true that some undocumented residents are paid lower wages than citizens, many are not victims but have been comfortably working for years. Indeed, nearly 80% of those living illegally in this country have been working here for more than a decade.
Miller and his fellow travelers suggest that this is all a drag on the economy, a burdensome expense. But that, too, is false. 
In addition to the economic activity they generate, undocumented workers pay taxes — using taxpayer identification numbers, many pay federal income taxes. Others share housing, often with documented family members, and help pay property taxes. 

Many of these workers have Social Security money withdrawn from their paychecks but, since they are using fake Social Security numbers, they never get the benefits at the other end — which means they help prop up that system for others. 
And, of course, they pay sales taxes, which are especially vital to local governments. 
California’s undocumented workers contribute $23 billion a year in federal, state and local taxes. Their direct pay alone amounts to 5% of the state’s economy, a new study shows.
Pulling them out of the workforce, either to send them out of the country or chasing them indoors to avoid detection, hurts not just them. It hurts Los Angeles.
In fact, if deportation enthusiasts got their fondest wish, it would hurt the entire country.
One study concluded that if the government succeeds in deporting every person currently in the country illegally, it would result in a 1.4% drop in Gross Domestic Product in the first year, with losses rising thereafter. The economy would shed more than $5 trillion. 
Those are studies. And then there is life in the city. 
Los Angeles, like any city, would welcome the removal of dangerous people. But that’s not who’s being grabbed. Immigrants in the country illegally tend to be more law-abiding once here than native-born Americans.

Under Trump, more than 70% of those seized in these disruptive raids have no criminal record at all, and many more have only minor traffic or other offenses. All told, about 8% of those snatched by ICE in recent months have serious criminal histories. 
That means more than 9 out of 10 gave no evidence of being a threat. Removing them separates families, devastates businesses and damages the larger economy — with no corresponding benefit to the safety of this community. 
You don’t snag criminals by raiding car washes and Home Depot parking lots. Washington may not get that — or may not care. But Los Angeles does. 
If those who are behind the recent immigration raids imagined that they were excising an unwanted, detached community from the rest of Los Angeles, they badly miscalculated. Instead, this region has demonstrated resolve and solidarity in the face of a threat that is not just economic but cultural as well.

Churches with large immigrant congregations are advising their parishioners to stay home rather than expose themselves to ICE. Hotels and businesses are flying Mexican flags in solidarity with their workers. 
Activists and everyday people are refusing to cooperate when masked agents, who themselves refuse to provide identification, demand it of others, often merely because of their skin color. 
The city of Pasadena, hardly a hotbed of radicalism, cancelled summer swim and park programs last weekend for fear that ICE would use them to snag suspects. 
Those actions prove a point: These immigrants, however they arrived or whatever their legal status, are integral to this region’s economy and to its sense of self. 
These are our neighbors, our friends, the friends of our children, our coworkers. Forcibly removing them is bad for them, of course. It’s also bad for the rest of us.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/070119-Immigrant-Rights-Protest-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420
,California,2025-06-26 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Turnitin charged some California colleges 3 times more for the same plagiarism detector,Tara García Mathewson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/plagiarism-detector-california/,Experts say companies often base their pricing on what they think colleges are willing to pay.,"In summary
Experts say companies often base their pricing on what they think colleges are willing to pay. 



If a California community college wants its faculty to be able to detect plagiarism and AI writing in student papers, it can buy software from a company called Turnitin at a discounted price. By banding together through the Community College League of California, each campus gets the purchasing power of the collective. Yet even though the league has more than four times as many colleges as the California State University system, its members pay more per student for Turnitin’s software.
And the Cal State system pays more than the University of California at Berkeley.
And UC Berkeley pays more than the City University of New York.
As part of an investigation into the consequences of this software’s use in higher education, CalMatters and The Markup collected purchasing records from approximately 60 California institutions as well as the CUNY system through public records requests. This investigation chronicles the dominance of Turnitin, which continues to collect millions of dollars every year from California colleges and universities despite its unsophisticated technology and its demand for a perpetual license to the student work it scans.
In reviewing records across California, CalMatters and The Markup also discovered wide variation in the amount Turnitin charged for its plagiarism-prevention tools, even when colleges were licensing the same product. While Turnitin did not respond to interview requests seeking information about its pricing strategy, experts said companies charge different amounts to different institutions based on how much they expect the institutions are willing to pay.
In 2020, Michel Davidoff retired as chief infrastructure officer in the California State University chancellor’s office, where he helped centralize technology purchases to secure huge discounts. When presented with the results of the CalMatters-Markup investigation into Turnitin pricing, Davidoff was not surprised. He said the size and reputation of an institution routinely sway the price of a given product.
“When Berkeley wants to negotiate pricing,” Davidoff said, “everyone wants the Berkeley logo on the website, knowing they bought it.”
Small colleges with little name recognition, then, get the worst deals. “They don’t have much money, they don’t have [many] students, and they’re paying the most,” he said.
The most extreme example of this variation came in records showing how much campuses paid during the 2021-22 school year. Turnitin had been flooded with customers the prior year when the Covid pandemic shut down campuses and instructors worried they couldn’t trust students at home. That year, UC Berkeley paid $2.11 per student for its Turnitin license. Cal State Long Beach and Antelope Valley College each paid $3.03 per student for the same product, records show. And the UC Irvine Division of Continuing Education paid more than double that, $6.50 per student.
Yet on the other side of the country, CUNY’s purchasing records show that the 200,000-student system got the best deal of all, paying just $1.79 per pupil for the same technology.

Davidoff, for his part, was pained to hear CUNY got a better deal than the Cal State system.
“CUNY? I’m crushed,” he said with a laugh.
Colleges tend to put out a “request for proposals” when they want to make institutional purchases. Companies then submit bids outlining the products they have, their capabilities, and the price. The Cal State system does not let companies charge significantly less than it costs to provide a product, but it otherwise encourages companies to give it the best deal they can.
The system last signed a contract with Turnitin in March of 2024, locking in the company’s basic plagiarism detector for $2.59 per student last year and $2.71 per student this year. For colleges to add the AI upgrade, Turnitin first offered institutions a total cost of $3.05 and $3.19 per student, respectively. Only six campuses took them up on the upgrade offer. But negotiations continued.
Leslie Kennedy, assistant vice chancellor of academic technology services for the Cal State Office of the Chancellor, reached out to her contact at Turnitin, saying there was demand for the detectors across the Cal State system, but that campuses couldn’t handle the cost.
“Turnitin came back to me and said, ‘We can give you better pricing if you buy for the whole system,’” Kennedy said. The company may have lost potential profits in discounting the AI detector for individual campuses, but it guaranteed itself more business. When Turnitin offered an additional 13% discount on top of the deal Cal State already had, Kennedy agreed to pay about $100,200 from her budget in the chancellor’s office to make it happen. And now 16 more campuses have access to the AI detector at a discounted price of $3.12 per student instead of $3.19.
Meanwhile, South Orange County Community College District is paying $3.57 per student for the same product this year.
While the per-student price for Turnitin sounds small, the cost adds up. The Cal State system has collectively spent over $6 million on this plagiarism-prevention technology in the last seven years. And UC Berkeley is in the middle of a 10-year, $1.2-million contract of its own.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the changes could cause nearly 9 million Americans to lose health care coverage. That includes approximately 130,000 to 160,000 annually in Missouri, said Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president of health policy and advocacy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, during a news briefing on Wednesday.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” proposes individuals ages 19 to 64 would need to work at least 80 hours per month to be eligible for Medicaid coverage unless they qualify for an exemption. These exemptions include, but aren’t limited to, people with disabilities, people taking care of dependent children and people who are pregnant.
Atate Sen. Patty Lewis, a Kansas City Democrat, described the bill as “devastating.”
Missouri’s Medicaid program, known as MO HealthNet, currently serves approximately 1.25 million people. This includes 660,000 children, 109,000 seniors and 186,000 people with disabilities, according to a joint news release from Lewis and the Missouri Foundation of Health.
Missouri receives $12.7 billion in federal funds from the program, and nearly two-thirds of the state’s Medicaid budget is made up of federal funding. The bill being considered by Congress would also introduce new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and scale back federal funding by an estimated $1.3 trillion over the next decade.
“Patients going through cancer treatment, going through chemo and radiation, who are immunocompromised, could be forced to be out in the community, working when that would be ill advised by their health care providers,” Lewis said.
Missouri has already seen 21 hospital closures since 2014, and another 25 are currently at risk as the proposed legislation moves through Congress. Weisgrau said rural providers could lose up to 21 cents of every Medicaid dollar under the bill.
Weisgrau said these hospitals are the largest or second-largest source of income for rural counties, so the cuts will affect income and lead to job loss if implemented.
“We are likely going to see rural hospitals close,” Weisgrau said. “That means job losses and economic ripple effects.”
MU Health Care and Boone Health are two of the largest hospital systems serving patients across mid-Missouri. Officials say that while the impact is unknown at this time, they are actively watching the legislation.
“This bill is unpopular and will harm and kill people if implemented,” Lewis said. “It’s vital that Missourians contact their representatives now.”

(Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Heading into the momentous 2023 legislative session, then-House Speaker Melissa Hortman was dealing with big, fractious and ideologically diverse personalities in her caucus.
“Dave Lislegard and I had been in a hot war with each other for two years,” said Rep. Aisha Gomez, a Minneapolis Democrat with punk rock tastes and socialist politics.
Lislegard is a self-described “Iron Range old-school Democrat.” 
Hortman’s plan was to have them take the lead on taxes, which would be an important policy lever as Democrats sought to spread Minnesota’s prosperity more widely. 
“I didn’t know how it would work out,” Lislegard said in an email.
Hortman persisted: “You guys are closer than you think,” she told Lislegard.
The result was a massive tax bill that created a steeply graduated child tax credit, among other progressive achievements. 
“Melissa saw what no one else did,” Lislegard said. “She had an ability to see what’s in people’s hearts and how we could take the best parts from our own unique backgrounds to build a partnership.”
Gomez and Lislegard say Hortman’s matchmaking fostered both a tax bill — and a lifelong friendship. But Hortman wasn’t doing it just to make friends.
It was a “totally shrewd move,” Gomez said, cementing the loyalty of the farthest right and left flanks of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor House caucus, which was key to securing the votes Hortman needed to pass Minnesota’s most ambitious legislative agenda in decades.
Hortman’s politically motivated assassination this month has left Lislegard and Gomez – and the entire state – in shock and grief.
“She was an amazing friend,” Lislegard said, “and I already miss her terribly.” 
The Reformer interviewed nearly two dozen legislators of both parties, Capitol staff, political operatives, and the many Hortman alums who have gone on to successful careers in business, law and public service thanks to her mentoring.
The portrait that emerges is of an unusual politician: She merely tolerated the spotlight, happily shared credit and accepted blame, eschewed higher office, and by all accounts was motivated chiefly by an interest in public policy, its details and how it could help as many Minnesotans as possible. 
Hortman, a Catholic Sunday school teacher, was also guided by an insight often lost on elected officials. 
“Selflessness enhances power. Strong leaders understand that,” said Larry Redmond, a DFL lobbyist whose political resume includes working as a political aide to Hubert Humphrey. 
Put another way, “She wasn’t about the bullshit,” Gomez said. “The TV cameras or the next higher public office. Or about being glorified or having everyone like you. She was about doing the best she could do for the most people.” 
On Friday, June 26, she will be the first woman in Minnesota history to lie in state at the Capitol, along with her husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever, Gilbert.

Losses and reused yard signs 
Hortman began her own political career by losing — twice, in 1998 and again in 2002. 
“Adversity is a good teacher,” Redmond said.
From those defeats and her time representing a swing district, Hortman learned the importance of maintaining contact with voters, especially by knocking doors — thousands of them. Years later, as a caucus leader, she also never forgot what it was like to defend a battleground.  
In 2004, she hired future DFL Rep. Zack Stephenson as her campaign manager as an early 20s college student with no political experience in what would become another pattern: nurturing talent.
Hortman’s lawn signs in 2004 said “It’s time to get the job done” and made the pitch that unlike the incumbent, she would get the north metro a fair share of road and bridge money.
She won by a few hundred votes in the same year Republican President George W. Bush won her district.
When she ran for reelection in 2006, she was worried about reusing the slogan “It’s time to get the job done,” because she was now the one doing the job.
“Melissa was frugal and really hated waste, so she didn’t get new lawn signs. She just cut the (old slogan) off all the lawn signs, hundreds of them,” Stephenson said.
A wonky policy profile with roots in environmentalism
Growing up, Hortman’s family owned a junkyard, and she prided herself on understanding blue-collar small business people, but she’d also been educated at Boston University and the University of Minnesota Law School. 
She took up the wonkiest of subjects: Energy law and what was then only just emerging as a major policy issue — climate change. 
She fought against the powerful auto dealers’ lobby — and some in her own caucus — in a seemingly quixotic battle to adopt stricter tailpipe emissions standards, which would come to fruition more than a decade later when Gov. Tim Walz used rulemaking to adopt the standards. 
In 2007, she played a role in passing a mandate for Minnesota utilities to generate 25% to 30% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025, an optimistic target at the time which the state reached early. 
She was also author of a landmark 2013 law that set solar energy standards for Minnesota utilities and kickstarted what was for several years the country’s leading community solar program.
“We called her the godmother of solar in Minnesota,” said Logan O’Grady, executive director of the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association.
When then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty vetoed a transportation bill after the I-35 bridge collapse, Democrats appointed her the chief spokesperson during the floor debate over overriding the Republican governor’s veto. 
“Here is someone in their second term and is being called upon to navigate what was probably the most significant floor debate of that decade,” said former DFL Rep. Frank Hornstein. “We prevailed, and it felt like winning the Super Bowl.” 
Later, she’d become known as a legislative fixer who could pick up an ailing piece of legislation and yank it across the finish line, as with a foreclosure reform bill in the wake of the housing crisis of the Great Recession. (Fresh out of law school years before, she’d worked for Central Minnesota Legal Services, where she won a then-record-setting verdict in a housing discrimination lawsuit.)

While her interest remained policy, Hortman was developing a theory of elections, politics and power. 
Democrats would wind up losing the majority during the 2010 Republican wave that swept all the way to Washington, and Hortman often relayed what a voter told her that year: He didn’t care what she had done in the Legislature. He was sending a message to Democrats.
This humbling moment was so seared in her brain that she would repeat it to legions of legislators and operatives over the years: Voters mostly don’t know who their legislator is, and they care even less. 
The national political atmosphere will determine the outcome of most elections. 
Within those constraints, however, candidates could eke out enough votes on the margins to win the close races that frequently determined control of the House. 
And the best way to do that was by knocking doors and having face-to-face interactions that voters would appreciate and remember. 
Later, as caucus leader, she kept a tally of the members’ door knocking stats and sent out an email with everyone’s scores, including her own. The message was clear: If you want a good committee gavel, you need to do the work. After a doorknocking session, known as “Speaker knocks,” they’d retreat to a local bar for fellowship. 
The doorknocking also informed governing, as the conversations helped Democrats create an agenda that people wanted. 
Her approach to power was similarly grounded in the knowledge that it was fleeting. 
When Democrats controlled both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office in 2013-14, they debated how boldly they should govern, with an eye on the 2014 midterm election. 
On issues like a gas tax increase for transportation, drivers licenses for undocumented people and restoring ex-felons’ right to vote, some Democrats wanted to play it safe.
Lars Negstad, the policy director for the progressive ecumenical group ISAIAH, said Hortman made the kind of blunt argument she was famous for in an environment more often known for Scandinavian reticence. 
“We’re gonna lose anyway. We should just do it,” Negstad recalls her saying, anticipating the go-for-broke 2023 legislative session a decade later, when Democrats passed all three of those policies. 
An underestimated minority leader
Hortman became the House DFL leader in 2017 at a perilous moment for the DFL. Republicans had defied political gravity and picked up House seats in 2016 while taking control of the state Senate. Democrats feared Minnesota would go the way of Scott Walker’s Wisconsin, with its gerrymandered, permanent GOP majorities and attack on collective bargaining rights. 
She immediately made the kinds of sweeping changes that would become her management hallmark.
Brynn Hausz, who worked for Hortman in those years and is now intergovernmental relations director for St. Paul, recalled that a woman DFL legislator warned about “the optics” of Hortman’s all-female staff. 
Hortman replied, “I don’t remember anyone complaining when the leadership team was all men.”
In another instance, Hortman defended Hausz when a member of the caucus tried to have her fired. Hortman gathered the facts, and that was the last Hausz heard of it. 
“She had my back,” Hausz said.
Susie Malmberg-Merthan, who was a media and political advisor, said Hortman worked her staff hard — though she always outworked all of them herself — modernizing and systematizing both the caucus and the campaign. 
She didn’t suffer fools, but even her famously salty, cutting remarks came with a signature twinkle in her eye, and she was equally known for small kindnesses gifted upon the dozens of people in her orbit. 
Hortman won the loyalty of her caucus and many Minnesota Democrats during a moment of spontaneous anger.

Marching on freeways had emerged as a way to protest unconstitutional policing and Black men dying at the hands of police, including Philando Castile in 2016.
Republicans sought to stiffen criminal penalties for  the highway marches. 
As Democratic women of color talked about the nation’s history of racial injustice and the nonviolent resistance of the Civil Rights movement, some Republicans left to play cards in what’s known as the retiring room off the House floor.
I.e., women were talking and the men weren’t listening.
Hortman rose and made a point of privilege.
“I hate to break up the 100% white male card game in the retiring room,” Hortman said. “But I think this is an important debate.”  
Republicans asked Hortman to apologize, but she was unfazed. 
“I’m really tired of watching women of color, in particular, being ignored,” she said. “So, I’m not sorry.”
The moment went viral, known as “Sorry, not sorry.” 
Lt. Gov. Flanagan, who was one of the women Hortman was advocating for on the House floor, said the moment felt like a first.
“I remember in that moment just being like, ‘Oh, she’s got our backs.’ And in a way that in politics I just had never experienced before,” Flanagan said. 
State Sen. Erin Maye Quade, who was in the House at the time, said that Hortman’s authenticity came through because she didn’t ask them about it beforehand. There was no strategy. 
Malmberg-Merthan said she remembers thinking, “Oh shit, there she goes.” 
Abou Amara, a former DFL House aide close to Hortman who is now an attorney, said Hortman had been quietly evolving and learning about racial justice issues as her district became among the state’s most diverse, and as policing emerged as a key issue for her constituents and caucus. 
“She was always growing in her representation of people,” he said. 
She was also raising money, recruiting candidates and knocking on doors, preparing for what she knew — having lived through the opposite scenario in 2010 — would be a good Democratic year.

A master negotiator emerges
Hortman became speaker during divided government, in what would prove to be some of the most tumultuous years in recent Minnesota history.  
She immediately made changes to improve the working conditions of members and staff. 
Unruly House debates have historically stretched into the early morning hours. 
“We all knew that eventually something bad is going to happen at 3 or 4 in the morning,” said former Rep. Pat Garofalo, a south metro Republican who served with Hortman for nearly two decades. She feared a member or staff would die in a car wreck. 
“Her thought was, ‘Rather than waiting for something horrible to happen. Why don’t we just do it now?’” Floor sessions have rarely gone past midnight ever since. 
Hortman always made sure to keep her office stocked with snacks and drinks. 
“I served under a lot of speakers, and she was the only one to make sure we were fully hydrated and ready for long floor sessions,” Hornstein said. 
When COVID-19 hit, the health and safety of the entire House and the staff became her focus. 
Longtime Chief Clerk Pat Murphy’s wife was immunocompromised, but the clerk had to be in House chambers. So, Hortman, who worked to create a system of remote voting, decreed that only people who had to be in the House chamber should be there.
Then-Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a Republican from lake country, said she was an excellent governing partner who became a friend.
“My connection to Melissa Hortman became very important to Minnesota,” said Gazelka, who compared their bond to that of soldiers of wildly different backgrounds coming together for a common purpose. 
After the police murder of George Floyd, the two worked out a compromise on policing reforms, which was a nearly impossible task given the passion of urban Democrats and the increasingly close relationship between Republicans and police. 
Neither the Democratic public safety chair in the House nor the Republican chair in the Senate wanted a bill because they were so dug in on their positions. “But by the time we hashed out what was in it, both wanted their names on it,” Gazelka said.  
It included a ban on chokeholds and the kinds of maneuvers used in the Floyd murder, while creating a duty to intercede when an officer witnesses another using excessive force. 
Negstad recalled that after a particularly grueling negotiation with Gazelka, Hortman tried to be optimistic about her differences with him: “At least he loves Jesus, so we have that in common.” 
During the years of divided government, however, Hortman was planning and preparing in case Democrats won a trifecta again: She ran ambitious bills like a new paid leave program through the gauntlet, knowing they wouldn’t even get a hearing in the GOP-controlled Senate. This way, they were vetted. Interest group allies knew the score. The opposition’s arguments were well known. When one paid leave bill author would leave the House, she’d assign another to pick it up.
A trifecta, and a historic session
After Democrats captured the Legislature in 2022, Hortman brought in Zach Rodvold, who was a key House aide during the previous trifecta, and former Dayton chief of staff Jaime Tincher, to talk to the caucus about how to use their newfound power. 
They had two messages: 
“Do as much good for as many people as possible.” 
“Do the right thing and the message will take care of itself.”
These two sentences remained on a scoreboard Hortman kept of all the bills the caucus wanted to pass. 
The result was a more ambitious legislative session than any in decades.
Democrats codified abortion rights; restored voting rights to people no longer incarcerated; allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain a drivers license; enacted a so-called red flag law to take guns from people deemed dangerous; mandated carbon-free electricity by 2040; fully legalized marijuana; and, made Minnesota a sanctuary state for trans people.
They passed one of the most significant pro-worker agendas in state history, including paid sick leave and a state-run paid family and medical leave program; banned noncompete agreements; and raised workplace safety standards at meatpacking plants and Amazon and other big warehouses.
They raised taxes in the metro for housing and transportation; they showered money on public building projects around the state and increased spending on education and human services.
To a large degree, this will be Hortman’s policy legacy, and for now, the results remain to be seen. 
The paid leave program launches Jan. 1. The marijuana market has struggled to get off the ground. The state, flush with cash just two years ago, confronts a serious fiscal imbalance, with deficits on the horizon. Population growth has remained relatively stagnant.

The toughest vote of her career, just days before her death
The voters returned a mixed verdict in 2024, sending to the House 67 Democrats and 67 Republicans. 
But the 2025 legislative session wound up starting with a temporary Republican majority, 67-66. Hortman, fearing Republicans would use the advantage to unseat a Democrat who had won a contested race, kept her caucus united in a three-week boycott. After prevailing at the state Supreme Court, she negotiated a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, including giving up the speakership to GOP leader Rep. Lisa Demuth. Later, the two would negotiate a two-year state budget. 
Demuth called Hortman a worthy adversary: “I have the utmost respect for her, even though we disagreed. She was incredibly brilliant as a politician, sometimes to my detriment.” 
As part of that budget deal, Hortman was forced to take the toughest vote of her career, ending state-subsidized health insurance for undocumented adults. She was the sole House Democrat to vote for it, upholding her end of the bargain, in exchange for keeping the government open and funding schools, safety net programs, parks and public safety and saving thousands of state workers from a damaging government shutdown.

In due time, city councils and school boards and legislators and governors will want Hortman’s name to grace the facades of community centers and schools and park buildings and roads and maybe even the newly refurbished State Office Building, a robust example of public architecture that she won in a negotiation with Gazelka. 
She would probably scoff at all that, however. 
Hortman loved gardening and wanted more trees planted on the Capitol mall. The area is relatively open with little shade and few places to sit down.
“She talked about bringing her grandchildren to sit under the shade of one of those trees on the front lawn, and that missed opportunity now is really heartbreaking,” Flanagan said. 
“We’re going plant all of the damn trees that Melissa ever wanted,” she said. “We will have trees that her grandchildren will be able to sit under and feel that clean shade and the love of a grandma they never met but is beloved by so many people in Minnesota.”

But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
Michigan is one of at least 37 states and Washington, D.C. that have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.












We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University




But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A man is dead. One man who was arrested is now out of jail. And the man who allegedly shot three bullets — including the one that killed “innocent bystander” Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo, according to police — is cooperating with law enforcement but is not in custody. 
Based on what’s been reported so far in the wake of the chaotic shooting during a “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City earlier this month, Utah gun law experts say the tragic situation is looking increasingly legally nuanced. And they say it’s possible any justice for Ah Loo and his family may be more likely to come from a civil lawsuit than a criminal case — but that remains to be seen.
“There was, from what it sounds like, a misunderstanding, which led to extremely tragic consequences,” said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council and a Utah gun law lobbyist. 
Man arrested in connection with shooting during ‘No Kings’ protest released from jail

According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting during the June 14 protest happened after two men, who described themselves to police as “peacekeepers,” confronted 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15 style rifle during the protest. One of the men, reportedly part of the event organizer’s volunteer security team, told police he thought Gamboa was acting suspiciously, which led him to fire three shots from a handgun, hitting Gamboa in the back but also inadvertently striking Ah Loo, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle, and his attorney said his rifle was not loaded. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
Last week, Gamoba was released from jail after the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office conducted a preliminary review of evidence. While the investigation continues, charges have  not been filed in the case, against either Gamboa or the unnamed armed security volunteer.

While police and protest organizers have not released the identity of the security volunteer, Utah 50501 said he is a military veteran and that members of the safety team were chosen for “military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience.” 
‘Peacekeeper’ involved in shooting at SLC ‘No Kings’ protest is a military veteran, organizers say

The national 50501 organization has disavowed the Utah chapter in the days following the shooting, pointing to a “strict no-weapons policy” for the groups it affiliates with. Salt Lake’s demonstration, which drew 10,000 people, was part of a national wave of protests that day criticizing President Donald Trump’s leadership and policies. 
To Aposhian, Utah’s nonrestrictive gun laws may offer protection for both Gamboa and the armed security volunteer who fired. 
“You know, my gut (feeling) is nobody’s going to be going to prison on this,” Aposhian said, adding that prosecutors likely face a “heavy bar” to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gamboa had malicious intent by openly carrying the AR-15 or was acting recklessly leading up to the shooting. 
Utah’s gun and self-defense laws and the factors at play
Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, meaning its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those 21 years old and over who are legally allowed to possess them. Plus, those ages 18 to 20 can carry a concealed firearm in public if they obtain a provisional concealed carry permit. 
Utah also has one of the “strongest” self defense laws in the country, said Mitch Vilos, a Utah attorney with expertise in weapons law and the author of a book comparing self-defense laws across all 50 states. Utah law allows the use of force, including deadly force, when a person reasonably believes it’s necessary to prevent death, serious bodily injury, or forcible felony. Utah is also a “stand your ground” state, meaning a person does not have a duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, including in public places. 
The details that will likely decide a potential criminal case or a civil lawsuit will likely come down to two things — intent and behavior — leading up to the shooting.

“Unless there’s something that shows Gamboa … had some sort of a manifesto or something,” Vilos said, then it’s likely prosecutors won’t be able to prove any sort of malicious intent on his part. And the “No Kings” demonstration reportedly wasn’t the first protest where Gamboa has openly carried that AR-15 style rifle. His friend and longtime roommate told The Salt Lake Tribune he’s brought it to protests at least a dozen times before, and never aimed it at anyone. 
And as for the armed security volunteer, “if he reasonably thought that a mass murder was in progress” in the moments before shooting and if prosecutors can’t provide “clear and convincing evidence that (his decision to shoot) was not self-defense or self-defense or another,” then a criminal case would likely be dismissed, Vilos said. 
“You know, (it seems) you have two people with good intentions, and to me it just doesn’t seem productive to bring a criminal case against either one of them,” Vilos said. “I think it’s more of a friendly fire incident than it is a case where you’ve got someone that’s acting violently towards someone with no good cause.” 
The self-described “peacekeeper” told police, according to an affidavit of probable cause for Gamboa’s arrest, that Gamboa had “lifted the rifle,” and witnesses said he had begun running toward the crowd while holding it in a “firing position.” 
But in the days since Gamboa’s arrest, videos have circulated online raising questions about whether Gamboa had actually raised the rifle in a firing position or charged the crowd. One video angle, reported by FOX 13, showed Gamboa with his rifle pointed down and not running until after one of the security volunteers started shooting.

Aposhian said it’s possible that prosecutors could argue the armed security volunteer acted negligently or recklessly. 
“If you’re acting in self-defense, and you shoot and your bullet overpenetrates, or richochets, or it misses its mark and it hits an innocent party, you’re not going to be criminally liable unless it can you can be found that you acted with negligence or reckless disregard,” Aposhian said. “It’s an unintentional type of thing, but they’re going to have to show that you acted with reckless disregard.” 
Additionally, Aposhian noted that acting in self-defense “certainly does not necessarily protect you from a civil suit.” 
Evidentiary standards in civil lawsuits have much lower thresholds than in a criminal case, both Aposhian and Vilos said. 
“In a criminal case, it’s beyond a reasonable doubt, and in civil it’s whatever tips the scales, a preponderance of the evidence,” Aposhian said. 
Vilos said depending on potential insurance coverage for the victim or the men involved, “there’s probably a chance for a significant civil settlement.” But insurance coverage could hinge on what happens with criminal charges, if there are any. 
“If anybody really cares about the family (of the victim), the best thing that could happen would be a civil lawsuit that’s successful, and to heck with the criminal action because it’s probably going to be a loser, and it’s going to take a lot of resources,” Vilos said. “And it could actually harm the ability of the family to collect a civil damage award.” 
Should Utah allow open carry of long guns during protests?
Unlike 26 other states, Utah has not adopted a law prohibiting the open carrying of long guns at state capitols or political protests, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.” 
When asked whether lawmakers would be open to considering some type of policy change to restrict the open carrying of long guns during protests given what happened during the Salt Lake City “No Kings” protest, House Speaker Mike Schultz told reporters last week “Utah is a very proud Second Amendment state.” 
Utah lawmakers briefed on ‘No Kings’ shooting in SLC, their security after Minnesota shootings

“Finding that balance is what we want to try to do, and I think we’ve done a good job with it in the past,” he said. 
Schultz, however, left the door open to a discussion. 
“As we enter into the legislative session and we have more details around what happened, I’m sure some of those conversations will happen and we’ll see where it goes from there,” Schultz said. 
Aposhian — who has been lobbying for Second Amendment rights for 30 years — acknowledged that carrying a gun openly, especially a type of gun “that has been demonized, an AR-15, it’s very provocative.” 
“And anything you do will be viewed through the eyes of someone who may or may not appreciate AR-15s,” he said. 
Aposhian added that today’s polarized political climate — and given that some protests across the country have turned violent — can contribute to tensions. 
However, Aposhian added that the open carrying of firearms “is and always has been legal in Utah.” 
He predicted that any efforts to regulate what type of guns can be carried openly during political protests would be met with resistance from Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature. And it’s not something that he or the Utah Shooting Sports Council would be supportive of, either. 
It would be an “emotional response,” he said. “Emotion really doesn’t make for good laws.”
So while open carrying a gun like an AR-15 rifle may be “provocative,” Aposhian said it’s also a form of exercising two constitutional rights — the right to free speech and the right to bear arms — at the same time. 
“Carrying that gun is utilizing both those rights,” he said.

A University of Alabama professor accused Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, of threatening the budget of an honors program if its curriculum wasn't changed to comply with Alabama's DEI ban. (Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector).BIRMINGHAM — A University of Alabama professor and administrator Wednesday accused a member of the Alabama House of Representatives of threatening a fellowship program’s budget if its curriculum was not changed to comply with a state law banning DEI programs and so-called “divisive concepts.”
In an evidentiary hearing in a federal lawsuit over the statute, known as SB 129, Dana Patton, director of the Witt Fellows Program and a political science professor at the University of Alabama, testified that university officials told her a “powerful person in Montgomery” was behind complaints alleging the Dr. Robert E. Witt Program, an interdisciplinary honors program at UA focused on community service, was violating the law.
“Clearly, a very powerful person was behind this complaint for me to be asked to provide such extensive detail about my course,” Patton said in testimony before U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor. “I did not know who she was referring to. When I hear ‘very powerful person,’ I generally think it’s either a big donor to the university, a board of trustee member or state legislator.”

The anonymous complaints, which Patton received on October 15 and read during her testimony, alleged that “divisive concepts (were) embedded in UA Dr. Robert Witt Fellows program.” It stated that five students complained that “the viewpoints in the required reading books are presented as the correct perspective, and other opinions are shut down,” and “the students have stated they feel unsafe and scared to speak in class, unable to express their viewpoints in the classroom or in class assignments.”

Patton testified that at a University of Alabama game on Nov. 16, 2024, she was introduced to Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, one of two legislative committees that oversees the Education Trust Fund budget, in the president’s box at Bryant-Denny Stadium.  
She further testified that at that meeting, she had a 45-minute conversation with Garrett where he asked her if she knew about the complaints, which she told him she did. According to Patton, Garrett said that Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, “was not going to let this thing go” and that she was very “tenacious.”
Citing the litigation, Garrett in a phone call Wednesday declined to comment on Patton’s allegations. A message seeking comment was left with DuBose.
The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged that SB 129, sponsored by Sen Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, violated the First and Fourteenth amendments by prohibiting public funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and limiting discussions of so-called “divisive concepts.” Plaintiffs also allege the new law is confusing, vague and discriminatory.
Patton also said she understood a comment allegedly made by Garrett at the UA game, telling Patton he is chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, as a threat against her university program.
“He told me he’s the chair of the budget. He’s in charge of the budget. He answers to the taxpayers. He controls the budget, and all of this conversation was in relation to talking about the complaint and talking about my program and my courses. Well, I took it very much as a threat against the budget of my program,” she said.
Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the members of the University of Alabama Board of Trustees, did not address those allegations or ask for clarification when cross-examining Patton, who said she does not know if any complaints were investigated and remains unclear whether they came from within the university community. 
After the hearing, Ezelle declined to comment on the complaints and would not vouch for their authenticity, saying that he didn’t want to possibly identify one of the anonymous complainers.
“I won’t comment on that,” he said, saying that his public comments are on the court record.
Garrett texted Patton following their introduction in November, according to evidence presented to the court, saying that he “will be working with (Vice Chancellor of External Affairs) Charlie Taylor to set up a time for you, the Honors College Dean and me to meet with a couple of other legislators who have raised concerns. As I expressed today, my desire is to address/resolve concerns and avoid potential major issues in the future.”
Patton said she “took that as a threat.” 
“Well, he wants to talk to avoid major issues in the future. He had made it clear that he controls the budget. He had told me that the state legislature was upset with the program. I’ve been asked about the books that I assign. He’s saying we need to avoid major issues. We need (to) compromise about my class and my decisions about it. It felt very much like a threat to me,” Patton said.
Patton said she has already made some changes to her courses as of her testimony Wednesday, and plans to make more for next semester. She has discontinued the use of the Harvard Implicit Association Test (IAT), a test that analyses a person’s subconscious bias.
 Patton said that while she was not asked to make that change, she’s afraid that it could lead to more complaints, putting her in a similar situation again. She said that while she tells students the IAT doesn’t label them as racist or sexist, she cannot control their “feelings of guilt,” which could lead to accusations of violating SB 129, especially concerning the law’s mention of subconscious concepts. 
In her introductory “Understanding Poverty” class, Patton said next semester she will stop showing three documentaries that tend to elicit “visceral reaction” and “feelings of guilt and anger” in students, particularly regarding topics like convict leasing.

The land shaded in pink could be opened for oil and gas exploration. (Department of Natural Resources map)The Alaska Department of Natural Resources is considering whether or not to open state-owned land near the Yukon River to oil and gas exploration.
In a public notice published in May and renewed June 18, the agency said it “intends to evaluate the acceptability of an oil and gas exploration license proposal for the Yukon Flats area.”
The Yukon Flats cover a vast area of Interior Alaska, and the state’s proposal includes only “unencumbered” state-owned lands, primarily near the Dalton Highway, the town of Livengood, the Steese Highway and the Yukon River town of Circle.
The Yukon Flats are a relatively unexplored region when it comes to oil and gas potential.
This summer, the private oil company Hilcorp is drilling for oil on land owned by the Alaska Native corporation Doyon Ltd.
Historically, the prospect of oil development in the area has been controversial; the Yukon Flats are home to the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to large amounts of wildlife.
The refuge is not included in the state proposal, and most of the refuge is a significant distance from the state-owned land being considered for oil and gas exploration.
The state’s exploration licensing program requires a public comment period before the DNR commissioner makes a final determination about whether state lands in the Yukon Flats should be open to exploration.
After that determination, interested explorers would be able to submit license applications that would permit them to conduct seismic surveying and test drilling for oil and gas.

That was the main message Wednesday for an online presentation featuring top executives from four organizations that have membership straddling the border. The presentation came just days before the teams face a deadline from Kansas on its proposal to build new stadiums for both teams.
“We get this question a lot,” said Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. “Does the regional business and civic community have a preference for which side of the state line or which specific location the teams land? No. As long as the teams land within the KC region, we’re going to support their decision, full stop.”
The presentation focused on how Kansas City competes with other metro areas. At no point during the debates in Kansas or Missouri over public financing for stadiums has either team said it was considering moving out of the region. 
Such a move would require the concurrence of other team owners. No city or state other than Missouri and Kansas have made public overtures to the teams. 
The sentiment that the state line was the smallest consideration for Kansas City businesses was echoed by the other participants, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, which hosted the presentation, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City and the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation.
“The more that we can stand united as one KC, and understand that our competition are those other regions that want the assets we have or are competing to attract what we want to get as well, I think we’re going to be stronger and we’re going to win,” said Joe Reardon, CEO of the Kansas City chamber.
Missouri special session ends with passage of KC stadium funding, disaster aid

Missouri lawmakers this month approved a plan to finance up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, committing almost $1.5 billion in future tax revenue. The current facilities, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, were opened in the early 1970s and almost all other stadiums built near that time are no longer in use, Reardon noted in the presentation.
Kansas, under a plan approved last year by the Kansas Legislature, is offering to pay up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums if the teams cross the state border.
During the debates in both states, the focus was on winning the “border war”. 
For Missouri, the loss of either team would mean another major league team leaving the state. St. Louis lost the NFL’s Rams in 2015, the football Cardinals in 1987 and the NBA’s Hawks in 1968. Kansas City lost Major League Baseball’s Athletics in 1967 and the Kings NBA franchise in 1985.
Kansas City is the smallest market that has both an NFL team and a Major League Baseball team.
For Kansas, it would be the first time a team from the NFL or Major League Baseball called the state its home.
“Our competition is not in Missouri or Kansas, it’s outside the region,” Cowden said. “We need to keep them at bay at arm’s length. This is not, in our opinion, about a border war. It truly is about a border solution.”
The success of Kansas City sports teams, especially the Chiefs, has raised the national and international profile of the region, said Kathy Nelson of the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation and Visit KC.
“They are opening doors to businesses like we never heard,” she said.
The Chiefs have played in five of the six most recent Super Bowls. The 2025 game had a national audience of 127 million and international audience estimated at 62 million. The romance between Taylor Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has also boosted the city’s profile, she said.
The Royals made the playoffs last year for the first time since winning the World Series in 2015. They have a more regional audience, she said, with 80% of game attendees living within 75 miles of downtown Kansas City.
“Nothing else puts us on a global stage like our sports teams,” Nelson said. “There’s nothing else like this.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KC-stadiums-2048x1150-1-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

The March Against Fear, which became known as the “Meredith March,” ended at the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson. James Meredith, who started the one-man march before being shot, had recovered enough to help finish it with Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke. Leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee used the event to organize Black voting across the state.

Gavin Newsom this week is a noteworthy — even heroic — response to financial problems caused by factors beyond their control, particularly President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
A summary of the $321 billion agreement issued by the state Senate declares, “Through the work of the Legislature and the governor the past two years, the budget was once again stabilized, with the governor’s January 10 proposed budget being balanced without needing new solutions. Unfortunately, since January, circumstances have changed, and California now faces a significant budget shortfall.”
“First and foremost,” the summary continues, “the policies of the new federal administration — in particular the tariff increase policies — have caused economic forecasts throughout the world to be significantly downgraded.”
It goes on to cite “to a modest degree, the baseline costs of key programs — particularly Medi-Cal — have grown faster than projected … and third, to a smaller degree, the devastating LA fires have had a negative economic impact and resulted in increased state spending.”
That scenario is fictional, conjured up to mask the fact that Newsom and legislators have been overspending revenues for three years, ever since the governor erroneously declared that the state had an almost $100 billion surplus — long before fires hit Los Angeles and Trump was inaugurated.
The supposed surplus ignited a multi-billion-dollar flurry of new spending in 2022, that has persisted. The administration finally admitted, a year ago, that it overstated projected revenues by $165 billion over four years.
The initial 2025-26 budget that Newsom proposed in January had an $11 billion general fund gap between revenues and spending. His revised budget, released in May, had a $19 billion deficit even with a number of spending cuts, mostly in services for the poor and elderly. The budget deal expands the deficit to $21 billion.
Newsom’s revised budget started the blame-it-on-Trump syndrome and legislative leaders quickly embraced it to explain away their chronic failure to either reduce spending or raise taxes to balance income and outgo, a condition known in the Capitol as a “structural deficit.”
Thus all of the versions of the budget, including the semi-final one unveiled this week, would fill the gaps for another year with payment deferrals, loans, accounting gimmicks and raids on reserves meant to cushion the effects of genuine emergencies.
Direct and indirect loans to the general fund budget come from special funds set aside for specific purposes, and after three years of deficit spending the state has accumulated many billions of dollars of internal debt that will have to be repaid sometime.
The accounting gimmickry takes several forms, such as delaying $2.3 billion in support payments to community colleges and local school systems that are due in June 2026 until a month later, thus shifting them from one fiscal year to another.
Officials call such maneuvers “solutions,” but they don’t solve anything. They merely stave off the day of reckoning when officialdom runs out of tricks. That day will probably come after Newsom has left the governorship and is, perhaps, running for president.
In effect, the state has adopted the same hide-the-pea approach to budgeting that the federal government employs, one that has resulted in a multi-trillion-dollar national debt. Trump, by the way, appears to continue that spend-now-pay-later practice with his “big beautiful bill” that, by all accounts, would grow the national debt even more.
Were a private corporation to cook its books like the state government does, its executives could wind up in jail for fraud. For some strange reason, however, California’s voters continue to tolerate the Capitol’s chronic fiscal malpractice.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

The House District 63 seat opened up after Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned earlier this month to become president of the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Judith Taylor, a Democrat, is a first-time candidate who said she is running for office to give voters a choice.
“I am really tired of not having Democrats on the ballot,” the 63-year-old retiree said in an interview Tuesday morning. 
She said she wants to prioritize reducing poverty and food shortages, improving the quality of public education and monitoring out-of-state property owners.
“We desperately need public education, and it shouldn’t cover the cost of someone going to private school,” the first-time candidate said.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like education savings account that allows applicants to spend up to $7,000 on education-related expenses, including private school tuition. It is funded through the Education Trust Fund, which is the state’s budget for public education.
She said that she is concerned about foreign entities and corporations owning land in Alabama, but not having to pay their share of taxes.
“I think it’s time we looked at all people and the least of us need to have the benefit,” Taylor said. “I do think that corporations should pay their share, and I think the wealthy among us should pay their fair share. I don’t resent paying more in taxes than a lot of poor people do, but I do resent that I’m paying more in taxes than Walmart.”
Norman Crow, a Republican and Tuscaloosa city councilman, said the opportunity to represent Tuscaloosa County in Montgomery is furthering his passion for public service. 
“When Cynthia, Representative Almond, resigned her position to take the president of the Public Service Commission, I felt like it was a huge opportunity for me to take another step towards serving our community on a statewide basis,” the real estate agent said in an interview Tuesday evening.
He said he wants to prioritize maintaining a business-friendly environment in Alabama, furthering economic development and improving education.
“I think that being supportive of workforce development is very important,” the 57-year-old said. “Having our communities in Alabama ready for the potential growth that needs to happen for good paying jobs is important.”
He said that improving education goes beyond educating children, but also includes educating adults for the future.
“Continuing to work to improve education in the state of Alabama is so important to prepare our students, but also adults, for the jobs of tomorrow,” Crow said.
Taylor said that voters should choose her so the Legislature has more Democrats and diverse debates.
“I think they should choose me because I care about the people, the common everyday people, and I think that those who are underserved need someone to speak for them,” she said. “I think that we need more Democrats in office. We need more options for our voters, and we need different sides for the issues to be discussed.”
Crow said his political experience and familiarity of the district makes him the best candidate. 
“I really know the district, and I feel like I’m in a good position to understand constituents and help with what the priorities of District 63 are,” Crow said.

But the cuts could hit harder, later, they were warned.","The West Front of the U.S. Capitol in May. Lawmakers are scrambling to finish a budget reconciliation bill that will make deep spending cuts. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Coming federal budget cuts will likely have severe impacts on Maryland, but they could come later than expected and their impact will not be felt right away, lawmakers were told Wednesday.
But that little bit of breathing room will not change the fact that the state still needs to brace for potentially massive cuts to programs like food assistance and Medicaid, state analysts and officials said.
The comments came during the first meeting of the new Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee, created this session to track how policies from the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress could affect Marylanders and the state.
“There are lots of enormous questions ahead for the state of Maryland,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during the 90-minute virtual committee meeting. “We want to make sure that we are monitoring the impact as we move forward.”
While there may be a longer on-ramp to the anticipated federal cuts, the impact will still be “dire and concerning,” House Majority Whip. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) said during the meeting.
Lawmakers heard from analysts with the Department of Legislative Services and federal relations officials from the governor’s office to get a layout of the current budget talks.
They also got an update from Attorney General Anthony Brown on the many legal actions Maryland has joined to challenge Trump administration policies changes, program cuts and federal worker firings, among other efforts.
Buyout offers, hiring freeze coming for state government amid budget crunch

David Romans with DLS said that the cuts for fiscal 2026 are “not as horrible as we had worried about” duringn the legislative session, but that cuts down the line will be “more significant.”
“We think the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and Medicaid changes will likely increase state costs by somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in fiscal ’26,” Romans said. “Part of the reason for that … is that some of the provisions have delayed effective dates. So a lot of things that are going to cause problems for the states don’t go into effect immediately.
“The outyear impacts are much more significant in our view. And again, it depends on where the (U.S.) House and Senate end up,” Romans said.
Some of biggest concerns are cuts to SNAP, as both the U.S. House and Senate plan to shift more of the cost burden onto states and reduce federal spending for the program. Romans said that the risk for Maryland in out years is up to $450 million annually, according to DLS estimates.
He said the state may save some money from lower Medicaid enrollment, which could offset anticipated increases to administrative costs needed to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on recipients that will be required under the bill.
But lawmakers argued that those savings, if any, would be quickly consumed by the rise in “uncompensated care,” as more uninsured people would likely seek health care from emergency rooms. Estimates from national health advocacy groups say that about 130,000 Marylanders could be kicked off of Medicaid due to work requirements that are part of budget proposals working their way through Congress now.
An additional challenge could be prohibitions on health care that goes toward undocumented immigrants.
Romans said that Maryland’s Healthy Babies Equity Act, which provides Medicaid coverage during pregnancy regardless of immigration status, might be at risk depending on how officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services interpret the bill.
He said that the state currently receives $100 million in federal funding for the healthy babies program that would no longer be available under the current budget reconciliation language.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But in addition to federal funding cuts, Maryland could be on the hook for financial penalties if the state continues to provide health care coverage for pregnant undocumented immigrants, even if the state only uses state dollars.
Matthew Verghese, director and senior adviser for the Governor’s Federal Relations Office, said that there are still details being worked out in the budget reconciliation legislation, and it’s not clear how the House and Senate will work out differences between their versions of the bill.
“I would not total all these numbers up to figure out what the impact of the state will be. Some of it is double-counted, but clearly we’re looking at potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in lost federal funds, and more administrative costs, if these changes go forward,” he said of the various cuts to Medicaid.
Currently, the budget reconciliation bill in the hands of the U.S. Senate has bigger cuts than the House version of the legislation — but would grant states more time to adapt to some of those cuts.
Legislative leaders had considered calling a special session later this summer to rapidly adapt the state budget or other policies, if necessary, in reaction to federal decisions.
Ferguson said that the urgency for a special session this fall has dropped, though they are keeping the option “on the back burner.”
“The necessity for a specially session is probably less than it was when we left in April. But there are still enormous questions out there that could shift things at any point,” Ferguson said to reporters after the briefing.

“It does look like … we will have time to deal with a lot of these issues in January” when the 2026 General Assembly convenes, he said. “And that the administration will have enough flexibility in the meantime to deal with some of the more pressing pieces and components of the bill.”
Fiscal house ‘built on sand’
But state Republicans repeated their charge that much of the problems Maryland faces under the budget reconciliation act are self-inflicted.
“Our generous Medicaid expansions and extensive support for undocumented immigrants are not federal mandates — they’re policy choices made here in Annapolis,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said in a written statement. “If we can’t afford them, we have the ability and responsibility to revise those policies.
“Instead, Maryland leaders double down, accepting limited federal funds to justify unsustainable programs that burden state taxpayers,” Hershey said. “It’s time to stop asking them to bankroll the liberal wish list.”
That was echoed by Sen. Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll).
“Ironically, the same state government that’s crying about unfunded mandates from Washington is the first to force them onto our counties,” Ready said. “We need responsible budgeting, immigration enforcement, and less reliance on Washington—because right now, our fiscal house is built on sand.”
The briefing comes just one day after Gov. Wes Moore announced a state hiring freeze and worker  buyouts with the goal of saving $121 million to help offset the tight budget in fiscal 2026, which starts Tuesday. That plan would appear to block previous goals of the governor, to fill vacant state jobs and hire federal workers who lose their jobs as part of Trump administration cuts,
Ferguson said the state will try to backfill as much lost federal dollars as possible to keep Medicaid and SNAP afloat, but with the state’s tight margins “it is likely that we will not be able to cover everywhere.”
“Given the scope of the challenges, it is unlikely that in the short term, that we will be able to provide at the same level that we have been able to,” Ferguson said after the meeting. “Given the destruction of the historic federal and state partnership that we have had for many of these safety net programs.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmay72025-4_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

The city’s acts amount to “the most severe violation of a court order witnessed by this Court in its extensive experience adjudicating high-profile litigation,” Williams wrote in an order filed Tuesday, adding the city’s “repeated, willful, and bad-faith defiance” of judicial orders “is unparalleled” and reflects a “shocking disregard” for the court, especially from a municipality.
MaQuade Chesley, Mesquite’s former police chief, is suing the city for wrongful termination and defamation. 
Chesley was fired in January by then-City Manager Edward “Owen” Dickie, who initially cited a vote of no confidence by the Mesquite police union as the reason for the termination. He later said Chesley was fired for recording a conversation, which is not illegal in Nevada. 
The Current was first to report multiple recordings Mesquite residents and Chesley provided of Dickie making racially-charged statements regarding the hiring of the city’s next police chief. 
The council, by a vote of 4 to 1, terminated Dickie in late April, citing the recordings. 
Chesley’s attorney, Philip Trenchak, contends in court filings the city is attempting to cover up its actions by failing to provide documents requested in the litigation, redacting entire pages, and cancelling scheduled depositions.
In an order issued Tuesday, Williams found the city engaged in “Bad Faith ‘Hide the Ball’ Discovery tactics,” and found the city “systematically and intentionally violated” his court orders by “producing deficient, redacted, and duplicative documents, asserting improper objections, and failing to produce critical evidence…”
Chesley, who joined the Mesquite police force in 2007, says rumors allegedly circulated by former City Attorney Bob Sweetin and then-Mesquite employee Shannon Harris, prompted what has become a drawn out legal battle.
“I was told and believe that both Sweetin and Harris joined together to spread defamatory lies about me,” Chesley told the Current on Wednesday.
The alleged rumors suggested Chesley was having sexual relationships with young girls. He filed a harassment complaint with Human Resources. 
“I’ve been a police executive for the past 14 years. I’ve always held myself to a higher standard,” Chesley said earlier this year. “To be accused of these things floored me. It destroyed me and my family.” 
Williams, in his order, wrote that Chesley sought unredacted responses to subpoenas served on the city, “particularly documents related to an investigation of Shannon Harris, who allegedly referred to Plaintiff as ‘Chief Pedophile.’”
Instead, the city “produced heavily redacted documents, with entire pages blacked out, citing attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, despite the Court’s order for unredacted production.”
Williams found the city’s “selective redaction” of the Harris investigation was unjustified, and “further supports a finding of bad faith.”
The city’s “heavy redactions of documents, particularly entire pages of the Harris investigation report,” demonstrate an intent to conceal evidence of misconduct by City employees, the judge wrote, adding the city’s actions have “severely prejudiced Plaintiff’s ability to prepare his case, as these materials are central to his claims of defamation and misconduct by City employees.”
Mesquite’s “egregious and willful violations, including untimely and deficient productions, misrepresentations to the Court, and obstruction of discovery, warrant sanctions,” Williams wrote, adding he’d determine after further briefing “whether the ultimate sanction of default is appropriate…” 
In the meantime, Williams awarded attorneys fees and costs to Chesley for recent motions related to the city’s failure to comply with the court. The city’s delay and obstruction “constitute a chilling effect on the litigation process, potentially deterring Plaintiff from pursuing his claims due to escalating costs and frustration.”
Williams also found the attorney representing the city, Jorge “Coco” Padilla, made misrepresentations to the court, an act he says “compounds the bad faith exhibited throughout the discovery process.”
Padilla said he hasn’t seen the order and declined to comment. 
The city’s acts, Williams wrote, undermine the integrity of the judicial process. He gave the city deadlines next month to comply with his orders.

O’Neil’s son was born 11 weeks premature and entered foster care as a newborn, which qualified him for Medicaid. At two months old, he was hospitalized with RSV, a respiratory virus that can be severe in infants, and diagnosed with subglottic stenosis—a narrowing of his airway. Doctors performed a tracheostomy, and her son required round-the-clock care and specialized medical equipment, all of which was covered by Medicaid.
Years later, surgeons rebuilt his airway. Because his adoption was nearly finalized, O’Neil was able to see for the first time just how much that hospital stay cost: over $100,000 just for a two-week stay.

Medicaid provided a stability O’Neil hadn’t thought possible. Since that two-week stay, her son, now six years old, has had five procedures, with a sixth planned for summer. And yet, she didn’t have to worry or fight with the insurance company.  Because of Medicaid, she was able to focus on her son.
“Because of Medicaid, my child, who could not speak a word until after he turned three, can talk and tell jokes and yell at his little sister,” O’Neil explained, adding that “most people don’t even know he ever had any medical issues.”
Now, she faces the uncertainty of another surgery this summer, and the looming threat that the federal government might cut the very program that has supported her family every step of the way.
For Sarah Abend, Medicaid was the only support that made her work—and life—sustainable. 
She was inspired to share her story by U.S. Sen. Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota), who recently claimed that “the best health care is a job.”
“I stand here as evidence that is not true, Senator Thune,” she said at Wednesday’s vigil. 
“I am the job, and I don’t come with health care,” Abend said.
Abend is an artist, former teacher, and small business owner. She’s also a Medicaid beneficiary– something she was once embarrassed to tell people. It felt shameful, she explained, “because our society taught me that needing assistance meant personal failure.”
However, Abend soon realized that utilizing Medicaid was not an indicator of personal failure. The failure did not lie with her, she said, but with the system– chiefly the idea that healthcare is a luxury, rather than a fundamental right. 
Moreover, Abend explained, our economy depends on creative and service work. And yet, that same system abandons these workers all too frequently.
“The economy depends on teachers, artists, service workers, caregivers, people doing essential work that often doesn’t come with benefits,” Abend said. “If we’re going to have a system that needs low-wage workers to function, then we have a moral obligation to ensure those workers can afford to stay healthy and alive.”

For Nathan Dunbar, Medicaid was a new beginning.
“I had nosedived my life with drugs and criminal activity and being a general menace,” he admitted. Tired of prison and chaos, he sought to start over.
“I didn’t have any way to pay for the services I was going to need to unravel the screwed-upness I’d injected into my life,” Dunbar said. “I relied on Medicaid funds to help me figure out how to get my life going.”
Since 2016, he’s stayed sober, become a father, and works at Community Mental Health, mentoring other addicts in their recovery. Dunbar has become, in his own words, “an exemplary citizen.”
Still, he expressed concern for what the proposed cuts to Medicaid might mean for those struggling with addiction. 
“People need help, and if we have no way to deliver that help, then those people will be left to their own devices trying to figure things out,” Dunbar said. “If you don’t know the direction, you have to ask somebody, and if there’s nobody to ask because they cut all the funding, there’ll be nobody offering that direction. And our city, Lansing, our state, Michigan, the place we love, our neighbors that we care about, will all suffer.” 
Protect MI Care, in conjunction with the Governor’s office, has compiled “14,905 real stories from real Michiganders on how losing access to Medicaid would be detrimental to themselves and their families.” 
Binders full of these stories will be hand-delivered to the seven Michigan representatives who voted for the bill: Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet), Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), John James (R-Shelby Township), Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), John Moolenaar (R-Caledonia), and Tim Walberg (R-Tipton).
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives 215 to 214, and the U.S. Senate is anticipated to vote by the end of the week.
Meanwhile, Protect MI Care will be hosting a Hands Off Medicaid Rally on Saturday in Lansing. Speakers will include U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), Michigan leaders, and healthcare advocates from across the state.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Several state legislators want to take the New Jersey State Police out of the state attorney general’s supervision and make it its own entity, a move that comes amid escalating tensions between the two.
Under a bipartisan bill introduced last week, the 3,000-member agency would no longer be a division under the Department of Law and Public Safety, which Attorney General Matt Platkin heads, and instead would become a state department, with its superintendent answering directly to the governor.
Sen. Michael Testa (R-Cumberland) said he signed on as one of the bill’s five sponsors because of directives Platkin and his predecessor, Gurbir Grewal, have issued in recent years that limit police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents and divert law-breaking youth from criminal justice involvement.
Those directives have kept officers from doing their jobs, Testa said. The agency’s top brass should instead decide policing policies, he added.
“I want the state police to have the handcuffs taken off of them and put the handcuffs on the criminals, where they belong,” he said.
Beyond disagreements over directives, the attorney general’s role in ensuring police accountability also has increasingly put him at odds with the state’s largest police force.
Platkin’s office oversees police licensing, investigates fatal police encounters and official misconduct, and publicly reports major discipline levied against officers statewide. He’s issued bombshell reports on racism in the agency’s promotions and internal affairs and has been investigating allegations that state troopers reduced traffic enforcement in response to racial profiling claims.

Several of the bill’s sponsors deny that it’s a response to such scrutiny.
“This legislation has nothing to do with that,” said Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris).
It has more to do with bureaucracy, he added.
“I’ve heard from a number of retired troopers over the last couple of years that promotions are slow getting done, that different things that are requested take a long time to get approved,” Bucco said. “That makes an awful lot of sense because the attorney general’s office is enormous. The Department of Law and Public Safety is enormous. The attorney general has a lot on his plate, and to put the state police in there as a division promotes, almost, that turmoil because sometimes they can’t operate as efficiently and as quickly as they should be able to.”
Sen. Robert Singer (R-Monmouth) conceded that Platkin has ruffled a lot of feathers since he became attorney general in February 2022.
“I don’t think the AG has missed poking anybody in the eye, from the governor on down,” Singer said.
But he said he signed on as a bill sponsor because he felt the state police deserve “a seat at the table,” and Col. Patrick Callahan, the agency’s superintendent since 2017, should have equal footing with other members of the governor’s cabinet.
Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), the bill’s leading sponsor, seconded that sentiment but also pointed to Platkin’s lack of policing experience.
“We have a politically appointed attorney general, a politically appointed lawyer, who really doesn’t know anything about policing and has never been a cop, and he is telling a force of men and women who are professionals in policing what they can and can’t do,” Beach said. “I just don’t think it makes sense.”
Mike Symons, a spokesman for Platkin’s office, and Murphy spokeswoman Tyler Jones declined to comment. Spokespeople for the state police didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 Attorney Gregg Zeff, who represents the state NAACP, said the group wants changes to the bill to ensure robust, independent oversight of the police. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
The bill has the cautious support of the NAACP New Jersey State Conference, whose leaders have long called for a clean sweep of the state police’ top brass over discrimination concerns.
Attorney Gregg Zeff, who represents the NAACP, said the group supports the bill conceptually but wants improvements to “give it teeth.” That could come in the form of other legislative efforts to create an inspector general in New Jersey to ensure robust, independent oversight of the police.
“The primary function of our State Police is law enforcement and public safety. The attorney general’s primary function should be legal leadership, oversight, and prosecution. The overlap in these functions makes it difficult in both offices to avoid conflicts and provide appropriate leadership without blending many separate issues together— resulting often, in our opinion, in quid pro quo decisions, actions, and compromises that the public cannot easily reconcile,” Zeff said in a statement.
Lauren Bonds heads the National Police Accountability Project.
State police being under the direct supervision of a governor is “the standard model” in most states around the country, she said. But shifting who’s tasked with police oversight for political reasons also is common, she added.
“This is usually a supportive relationship that you see between state police and the state’s AG, but there can be times where there is tension and division, when the attorney general is maybe a progressive prosecutor or somebody who came in with police reform being one of their top priorities,” Bonds said.
The bill has no Assembly companion and is unlikely to pass this legislative session because lawmakers are expected to recess by Tuesday for the summer and not return until after the November general election. They then have less than two months to act on unfinished business before the next legislative session begins Jan. 13.
January is also when a new governor will be sworn in — Murphy cannot seek a third term in November — who will presumably name their own attorney general to replace Platkin.

Although Vermont has strong protections for abortion on the books, those protections mean nothing if patients have nowhere to access the service.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicole Clegg: After Roe, 3 years of resistance, care and community.","This commentary is by Nicole Clegg, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.


Three years ago, most Americans assumed that the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was the final check mark on the anti-abortion movement’s to-do list. Overnight, federal protections for abortions evaporated, and states suddenly had the power to decide who could access abortion and under what circumstances. 
But overturning Roe was just the beginning. The decision served as a catalyst to pass more restrictions on abortion and repeal safeguards for health centers providing abortion care, and it emboldened anti-abortion extremists to commit more violent acts — like the tragic events that took place in Minnesota. 
Support for abortion rights is the highest it’s been in history and 81% of Americans don’t want politicians involved in decisions about pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups know that pursuing a nationwide ban is politically toxic, but that hasn’t stopped them.
They’re reversing federal protections through executive orders, like the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, criminalizing abortion providers and patients, and hiding abortion bans in bills where they don’t belong. 
Congress is currently considering a budget bill that includes a provision to ban patients insured by Medicaid from getting care at Planned Parenthood. Despite the claims to the contrary, the bill has nothing to do with fiscal responsibility — banning Planned Parenthood would cost taxpayers $300 million — and everything to do with the fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortion care. 
If the measure passes and the Trump Administration withholds other funds we receive, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England would lose $5 million annually, or 42% of our patient revenue. These funds cover cancer screenings, birth control, wellness exams and so much more. We are a critical safety net provider in New England and without us, Vermonters will suffer. 
This attack highlights that although Vermont has strong protections for abortion on the books, those protections mean nothing if patients have nowhere to access the service. Planned Parenthood health centers are an irreplaceable part of Vermont’s health care system, serving nearly 16,000 patients annually who rely on us for birth control, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings and other preventive care. Patients and communities in Vermont will suffer.
In only three years, we have heard countless stories of women getting turned away from emergency rooms, medevacked to a “legal” state, losing their ability to become pregnant in the future and in some cases, even losing their lives. It’s an injustice and could jeopardize the future of an entire generation. At PPNNE, we are determined to do all we can to safeguard our patients’ health and rights. 
We are expanding access to abortion. 94% of our health centers now offer abortion services, with a goal to reach 100% in the coming year. We’ve knocked down financial barriers by growing our abortion fund. PPNNE provides practical support to patients traveling to us for care, including help with lodging, travel, childcare and more. 
We opened our doors wider and welcomed patients from across the country — people who should never have had to leave their home state. 10% of our abortion patients hail from another state including Texas, Florida, and Georgia and other states where abortion is banned. PPNNE has served patients from 36 states since the fall of Roe. 
We’ve also seen firsthand the emotional toll this crisis has taken. Patients often arrive at our health centers exhausted and scared. But they leave with dignity, care and support — because we believe your access to care shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code. 
The overturning of Roe may have been the green light for the anti-abortion movement. But it has also served as a spark for PPNNE and our communities. When access to abortion is under attack, we become the shield.
We stand between harmful policies and the people they’re designed to hurt. We show up — every day — to protect care, to protect patients and to protect the fundamental right to make personal decisions about our bodies and futures. And we won’t give up until that freedom is guaranteed for all.

Passing something that is rushed and does not promote equity, affordability or quality schools is not better than nothing.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver: A dereliction of duty.","This commentary is by Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver of Moretown. She is the 2025 Vermont Teacher of the Year and teaches English and history at Winooski High School.


On Monday, I sat in the Senate chamber and watched a senator sleep through one of the most consequential bills in recent Vermont history. Then, I sat on the Statehouse lawn with my two young children, livestreaming the House hastily doing a voice vote, where many representatives appeared surprised by what they had just done. 
Earlier in the day, I spoke with many representatives who did not recognize the complexities of H.454: they did not understand the implications for small schools like the one I will send my children to, they did not understand the consequences of what this would mean to lose our unique Winooski School District, nor did they recognize that public funds will continue to be fettered to private schools which lack the same accountability as public schools. 
As a teacher, I pride myself on holding students to high-quality standards for their work. I do not ask my students to rush through their assignments. I ask them to take their time, consider multiple perspectives, share with stakeholders, receive feedback, and revise, revise, and revise. Why are our lawmakers not doing the same?

I also teach my students that their voice matters; that in a democracy, they have representatives that represent their interests. This message rings hollow when they see it not fulfilled. My own senator, Sen. Cummings, did not respond to a single email from me and stated publicly she “stopped doing emails when [she] didn’t feel I could bleed anymore.” Sen. Baruth, representing Winooski where I teach, did not engage in dialogue with our school district once.
In the days and weeks leading up to the consequential vote, we heard again and again from lawmakers that passing something is better than nothing and that taxpayers want tax relief.
First, passing something that is rushed and does not promote equity, affordability, or quality schools is not indeed better than nothing. In my classroom, I mark work like this with a “NY”: not yet. Try again.
Second, taxpayers do indeed want tax relief, and the bill that Gov. Scott, Democrats and Republicans are celebrating does not provide it. Shame on our governor for putting us in this position and shame on everyone who followed suit.
In the coming weeks and months, there will be many small committees tasked with big decisions that will impact every student in our state, and thus play a lasting role in our state as a whole. I ask our lawmakers to think critically about the same questions I ask my students to think about: Whose voices are being heard? Whose voices are not at the table? How do these decisions affect the most vulnerable in our community?
Chances are, once again, teachers and students will not be there. A student texted me after the House voted for the bill, asking eagerly what happened. When she learned the fate of H.454 her response was plain and clear: “When has the government ever been on the side of education or the side of students’ like me?”
So lawmakers, please prove her wrong. Please let her know that you are on her side. Decisions that impact her future, that will destroy her district and the unique aspects of Winooski, are now in your hands, sadly.
And to everyone who cares deeply for public education, please stay engaged and keep fighting. My two children, who played on the state lawn before later holding protest signs against ICE, now associate the “golden dome” with making decisions that “hurt our school.” Our young people are always watching; show them that you care about their future.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana has used more than $491,000 in public funds to defend Attorney General Todd Rokita in multiple disciplinary investigations and formal ethics cases, according to new records obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
The state paid four law firms a combined $491,508 between 2022 and 2025 to represent Rokita in at least six separate matters before the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission — investigations that the Republican describes as politically motivated and retaliatory. 
Only two of the investigations resulted in formal disciplinary charges.
The Capital Chronicle previously reported partial figures showing dollars spent on Rokita’s disciplinary defense, but new records provide a more complete accounting.










We’re paying four law firms close to half a million dollars so that Todd Rokita can keep his law license and stay in office. That’s a campaign expense — not something the public should have to fund.


– Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis


The highest payment — more than $240,000 — went to Indianapolis-based Ammeen and Associates, which represents Rokita in the current ethics case still pending before the disciplinary commission.
The state paid an additional $177,650 to Greenwood-based Patrick Olmstead Law; $57,995 to Washington, D.C.-based Schaerr Jaffe; and $15,560 to Indianapolis-based Lewis and Wilkins, according to information released by the attorney general’s office.
Indiana’s Transparency Portal shows the legal firms have previously been contracted by Rokita’s office and other state agencies to assist with separate litigation and legal matters.
But Democrat Rep. Ed DeLaney, a longtime lawyer from Indianapolis, maintained that taxpayers “shouldn’t be footing the bill.”
“We’re paying four law firms close to half a million dollars so that Todd Rokita can keep his law license and stay in office,” he said. “That’s a campaign expense — not something the public should have to fund.”
Indiana has in the past covered legal costs for public attorneys, judges, and prosecutors facing complaints that arise from actions taken in the course of their official duties, as long as those actions aren’t criminal or personal in nature. One section in Indiana Code specifically requires the state to indemnify prosecutors for expenses incurred in lawsuits or disciplinary proceedings related to a “decision, a duty, an obligation, a privilege, or a responsibility of the prosecuting attorney’s office.”
Years of disciplinary investigations
The ongoing complaint stems from Rokita’s nationally televised comments in June 2022 about Indianapolis OB-GYN Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who oversaw a medication abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio that summer.
In an interview with Fox News commentator Jesse Watters, Rokita called Bernard an “activist acting as a doctor” and suggested that she violated patient privacy and state reporting laws. He said his office was investigating her conduct and would be “looking at her licensure.”
The Indiana Medical Licensing Board ultimately found that Bernard had violated patient privacy laws — resulting in a reprimand and a fine — but she was cleared of failing to report the abortion.
Rokita’s office settled an initial complaint about his comments in November 2023. In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to violating two professional conduct rules in exchange for a public reprimand. A third count was dismissed.
Story continues below.
Exhibit B – Affidavit
 
Although he agreed not to contest the charges, the commission found that Rokita recanted almost immediately, suggesting in a public press release — issued just hours after the reprimand — that he had done nothing wrong.
The commission said Rokita acted with “a deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth” and has since opposed his request to dismiss the new charges.
But he maintains the taxpayer expense is the result of a politically charged and unaccountable disciplinary process.
“These investigations require time away from the job Hoosiers elected me to do,” Rokita said in a written statement. “Regardless of their false, politically motivated nature, each grievance, investigation and complaint requires time, attention and office resources to combat.”
“The Commission has caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money to be wasted and there is no end in sight,” he added.
Disciplinary commission rejects Indiana AG Todd Rokita’s call to dismiss latest ethics complaint

James Ammeen, one of Rokita’s defense attorneys, said “the Commission has caused this expensive situation by entertaining politically motivated grievances and by drawing out these investigations as long as legally possible only to not file anything in several cases.”
Three of the six investigations into the attorney general’s conduct originated from a single source, Indianapolis attorney Bill Groth. The labor lawyer was named the Indiana Democratic Party’s “Activist of the Year” in 2018 and has advocated for labor unions, employees and other progressive causes.
The disciplinary commission does not name complainants unless a case becomes public, but Groth and another Indianapolis attorney, Paula Cardoza-Jones, have openly revealed the grievances they filed. Republican State Sen. Liz Brown just last month also said she filed a complaint against Rokita.
“This whole thing still stems from 16 accurate words that I said on a Fox News interview over three years ago,” Rokita said. “Every complaint after has just been a follow-up to try and get me for something because they hate the issues I fight for on behalf of Hoosiers.”
“I accepted responsibility for the timing of my initial comments and indicated at the time that I could always do better,” he added. “Now, the Commission wants to waste time and money claiming I wasn’t ‘sorry’ enough, and wants a new punishment for 16 words said over three years ago.”
Rokita decries system
While defending himself, Rokita has also offered up proposed changes to how the disciplinary commission operates. 
He holds that the members shouldn’t be able to give political donations, and also called for commission meetings involving elected officials to be open to press and public scrutiny.
Rokita and his legal team have accused current and former members of the disciplinary commission of partisan bias. The attorney general specifically took aim at former Chair Bernie Carter, a Democrat who previously served as Lake County prosecutor.

Although he did not vote on Rokita’s current disciplinary complaint, Carter oversaw the commission when multiple earlier investigations into the attorney general’s conduct were opened.
Rokita’s office also pointed to current commission Chair Peter Rusthoven, a Republican lawyer who previously worked within former President Ronald Reagan’s administration.
Amid a GOP split by those who support President Donald Trump — and those who don’t — Rusthoven endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024. Although a longtime GOP donor, he also made contributions to her campaign, and to those for Joe Biden and Liz Cheney — all prominent Democrats or vocal Trump critics.
Rusthoven also believed Trump should be removed from the ballot while Rokita’s office was involved in litigation defending Trump’s candidacy before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“Some Commissioners undoubtedly disapprove of what the attorney general does and says in office,” said Rokita attorney Paul Mullin, “and (are) willing to impose the minority’s view despite (him) being elected by the largest number of Hoosiers in Indiana history.”
Although most disciplinary commission members donate to political candidates, Rokita said such contributions further undermine the body’s impartiality.
“The Attorney General has been nothing but transparent,” Mullin continued. “Instead, this process is being misused by political enemies and those working against the duly-elected AG’s policies. The strategy is to punish his own truthful speech, causing unneeded public expense and distraction.”
The disciplinary commission operates largely in secret under rules designed to protect reputations during the initial investigation phases. Rokita said that amounts to a lack of transparency, which leaves taxpayers in the dark.
Critics push back
But Rokita’s critics said the attorney general has blurred ethical lines by leveraging his public office for political messaging. 
DeLaney, the state lawmaker, argued that Rokita’s conduct, especially his public comments about Bernard, had little to do with his official duties and instead reflected personal political choices.
 Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis. (From the Indiana House Democrats)
“We didn’t say he had to go on national TV, and we certainly didn’t tell him to say what he said,” DeLaney added. “This isn’t about serving the public. It’s about preserving his own political standing.”
Former Attorney General Curtis Hill funded his own disciplinary defense, but his actions were after hours at a bar and were not work-related.
DeLaney also questioned why four outside law firms were needed.
“He doesn’t need four law firms,” DeLaney said. “He needs one person — to look in the mirror and ask if he’s solving problems or just being one.”
“Rokita brags every time he brings in a nickel for the state,” he continued. “But if we’re going to keep an accounting, we need to count what he’s spending, too. And I’ve never seen another official rack up this kind of bill to protect his own law license.”
Anja Matwijkiw, a professor of professional ethics and human rights at Indiana University Northwest, agreed that there are questions about whether Rokita was acting in his personal or official capacity.
“If he spoke as a private citizen, then his First Amendment rights to free speech are protected — but he should pay for his own legal defense,” Matwijkiw said. “However, if he intended to act in a public capacity, then arguably, the taxpayers’ money can be used. But that requires substantiation: documentation, legal references, citations. Otherwise, we risk entering a conflict of interest.”
She emphasized that the “appearance of a conflict is as important as the reality,” especially when public funds are involved.

“He can’t have it both ways,” she said. “That’s why clarity on his role and intent matters.”
Matwijkiw cautioned, too, against the way the disciplinary process itself is being framed by Rokita and his legal team.
She pointed to the attorney general’s use of the term “lawfare,” a label Rokita has used to describe the commission’s actions, as an example of politicizing the legal process.
“‘Lawfare’ is becoming a trend. It’s when legal arguments are turned into a weapon to undermine the other side rather than promote justice,” Matwijkiw said. “That politicizes the process and risks eroding the rule of law.”
She added that public officials invoking distinctions between law and ethics — such as Rokita’s previous suggestion that attorney ethics rules aren’t statutory law — only deepen the problem.
“If you’re introducing a distinction between ethics and law, then there’s an even greater need to protect the law itself,” she said. “What should come first is preserving the integrity of the law — not protecting political narratives.”
What comes next
The commission has declined public comment on the pending complaint against Rokita, and the case remains before the Indiana Supreme Court.
A decision on the dismissal motion and the disciplinary commission’s new complaint is ultimately up to the high court justices.
If the charges aren’t dismissed — or if the disciplinary commission and Rokita can’t reach a settlement agreement — the justices will appoint a hearing officer to hold a public hearing on the case and hear evidence.
It would be up to the hearing officer to then issue findings and recommendations to the court, which has final say over the outcome of the case.
Sanctions depend on the seriousness of the case. Possible sanctions include a private or public reprimand; suspension from practice for a set period of time; suspension from practice with reinstatement only after the lawyer proves fitness; and permanent disbarment.
The vast majority of grievances filed with the commission are dismissed, however.

(Getty Images)New Mexico could face ballooning costs to address oil and gas wells abandoned by operators – sometimes called “orphan wells” — and the problem is poised to get bigger, a new report said, as more wells reach the end of their lifespans
Current cleanup of 700 wells will cost $208 million and take close to a decade to complete, analysts from the Legislative Finance Committee estimated in a 47-page report released Tuesday. Future plugging of an identified 1,400 wells could cost New Mexico between $700 million dollars to as high as $1.6 billion.
“On top of that, there are more than 3,000 wells on state or private land producing extremely small quantities of oil and gas whose expected cleanup costs far exceed their predicted future revenues, increasing their risk of being orphaned,” the report says.
Unplugged oil and gas wells can pollute groundwater; pose threats to human health from wastewater or gas exposure; and can prevent further extraction from nearby wells. Private owners plug most wells, but since fiscal year 2019 the state has spent more than $50 million to plug about 1,000 orphaned wells.
Analysts recommended four policy proposals for lawmakers to incentivize oil and gas companies to address unplugged wells before they become a state problem.
They include: clarifying the definitions of abandoned and orphaned wells in the law; amending the state limits on bonds for drilling oil and gas wells to reflect cleanup costs; allowing for operators to fund cleanup through trusts; and providing state regulators the power to review or disallow the transfer of wells if the buyer can’t plug or clean them up.
Several other states adopted laws requiring operators to pay a fixed rate into trust funds for certain wells, according to Stephanie Joyce, a program evaluator for the nonpartisan Legislative Finance Committee.
“Think of it as something like a retirement account for a well, where companies put money into a fund over a well’s life, so the money is there when it is needed,” Joyce told lawmakers at a committee meeting in Taos.
Analysts also recommended the Oil Conservation Division adopt new rules to address wells at the end of their lifespan; change its bidding procedures; and adopt controls to ensure that the state is not overpaying contractors for plugging.
The report found the state’s costs for plugging wells have dramatically risen in recent years in part due to plugging deeper, more complex wells, and some inflation, but also due to procurement practices at the Oil Conservation Division.
New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Deputy Secretary Ben Shelton called the report “fair and comprehensive,” noting that the Oil Conservation Division was not originally set up to deal with orphan wells.
“We’re a regulatory agency set up to permit the operation of the oil and gas industry in New Mexico, this is something that has become a bit of an elephant that the division is dealing with,” Shelton said.
In addition, state laws obligating oil and gas companies to pay are insufficient to meet the costs of cleanup, analysts said.
State law limits oil and gas bonds plugging wells to $250,000 for all of a company’s active wells in the state — even as the average cost to plug one well last year was $163,000. More than three dozen oil and gas operators would be required to pay less than $1,000 per well, according to the report.
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) asked Shelton why the the Oil Conservation Division hasn’t pursued more funds from operators to reclaim public money spent on cleanup.
“The juice is not worth the squeeze,” Shelton responded. “I’m not going to send one of my three attorneys doing 100% of enforcement for the state on a two-month goose chase for a $50,000 bond — it’s just not worth the state’s taxpayer dollars.”
Shelton said he was hiring an additional attorney to help pivot to seeking assurance, but noted that it still is insufficient to pay.
Muñoz said the state was shirking its responsibilities to “go after bad actors,” and asked if the division was denying permits to operators with outstanding wells.
Shelton said state law doesn’t give the agency that power.
“The view right now is that we don’t have that sort of bad-actor review on that sort of personal compliance,” he told lawmakers. “If you start a brand-new company that has a clean bill of health and a clean record, then we don’t have the ability to come in and say ‘one of your officers has outstanding liability in another company.’”

Debra Stephens also has concerns, but her faith in the rule of law, the Constitution and the American judicial system keeps her centered and hopeful. 
Like other judges, justices and legal experts I talked to, Stephens holds a more historical perspective of our government systems. As we move deeper into the second Trump administration, you may not be able to embrace her optimism that things will turn out OK, but the data support her perspective. So far, states and advocacy organizations suing the administration over its policies and executive orders are overwhelmingly winning in court. 
America’s court system may be the only thing standing between us and the collapse of our democracy. But can it withstand relentless political pressure, a president flouting norms, and the more mundane challenge of just making sure the gears of the judiciary keep turning and cases move efficiently through the legal system?
According to The New York Times and others tracking court cases against the Trump administration, nearly 200 judicial decisions so far have halted at least temporarily the president’s initiatives. People have already died or been deported or lost their jobs because of Trump’s policies and actions, but it could be worse if the nation’s court system wasn’t as sound.
Stephens worries about courts getting bogged down in toxic public debates about socially divisive issues. But another risk to judicial independence that she flags is considerably less sexy.
“The greatest threat to judicial independence is that courts are overburdened and under-resourced. The ability to just get through those dockets with a limited number of judges is a chronic problem,” she said. 
Just taking care of everyday work is more than the current Washington courts can handle. When a big case comes onto a district court calendar, like the McCleary decision on public school funding or an upcoming adjudication of water rights in Whatcom County, the whole county may need to rewrite its court calendar and move staff and other resources around. 
Stephens said the judicial system, which represents about 0.08% of the state general fund budget, needs more money, but that’s not the whole solution. She thinks the state needs to make a broader social assessment of what we’re asking courts to do. Some things, like addiction, family unification, mental health and income insecurity, might need to move out of the courts into a different system.
Will the system be overwhelmed?
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown agrees that an overburdened judiciary could be a threat to judicial independence because it could lead to instability.
But he’s more concerned about the pressure the Trump administration could put on the system by doing things like attacking judges or calling for their impeachment.
People who would make good judges are already deciding not to pursue that career path, because of the hyper-partisan atmosphere in which they would serve. The assassination in June of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband only underscored the risks and fear public officials must confront these days.
Like Stephens, Brown remains confident in the integrity of the judicial system and doesn’t think it will be overwhelmed even as President Trump is “flooding the zone” with executive actions.
“Our court system will be fine. They’ll make it work,” he said, noting that the judiciary appears to be operating efficiently and independently. 
“And we’re winning. It’s the second quarter of the game, but we’re winning on the scoreboard,” he added. 
It’s the “next quarter” that raises concerns for Brown, his fellow attorneys general across the nation and the citizens who are paying close attention. The attorneys general are working with the courts to keep the pressure on the executive branch to make sure they follow court directives. But no one knows what the future will bring, especially if Congress doesn’t do its job to check the president.
The role of everyday Americans
Retired UW law professor Hugh D. Spitzer said one key to maintaining judicial independence is in the hands of the American people. Everyone should educate themselves about the separation of powers and let their representatives in Congress know how important an independent judiciary is to them. He and others expressed concerns about the need for more civics education and encouraged people to take advantage of any opportunity they have to serve on a jury as a great way to learn how our courts work. 
“On balance, I’m also optimistic that it’s going to work out. But you have to be vigilant,” he said.
Like all the people I interviewed for this story, Spitzer had a nuanced opinion on whether electing or appointing judges was better for judicial independence. But they all agreed that both approaches include some political pressure on those who hold the gavel. Longer periods between elections help with independence, they also agreed. Spitzer added that public financing of judicial races is better than expecting judges to raise money for their campaigns. This seems pretty obvious.
We’ve seen the way judges appointed by Republican presidents, including Trump himself, are stopping some of the current president’s executive orders. This is judicial independence working well: with judges focusing on the law and the Constitution and ignoring political pressures.
Both the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, John Roberts, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, have spoken out recently about the need for judicial independence and have criticized the president’s statements to the contrary. 
“Judicial independence is crucial,” Roberts said at a May gathering of judges and lawyers in Buffalo, New York. He praised the constitutional concept of the three co-equal branches of government. “That innovation doesn’t work if the judiciary is not independent,” he said.
In a talk at the Georgetown Law School in March, Sotomayor agreed with Spitzer that educating the public about the importance of judicial independence. 
“More than ever, we have to get up and explain and repeat and explain again why judicial independence is critical to everyone’s freedom,” Sotomayor said in response to a question about the role of courts in addressing growing challenges to the rule of law. “Once we lose our common norms, we’ve lost the rule of law completely. So it’s going back to figuring out what those are,” she added.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, nominated by President Joe Biden, recently warned at a conference of judges and lawyers about the danger of attacking judges for doing their jobs, as Trump has done, although she did not name the president in her comments. 
Hints from history
Judge Ketu Shah, presiding judge of King County Superior Court, said this moment in U.S. history will pressure test the judicial branch, but he thinks the courts are up for the test. 
He’s been thinking a lot about an 1803 Supreme Court decision, Marbury v. Madison, that made the judicial system what it is today by establishing the right of the courts to rule on the constitutionality of actions by the other two branches of government. 
“The chief justice at the time was very worried about judicial independence but not wanting to offend the current president, Thomas Jefferson,” Shah said. That decision set up the independence of the judiciary, which was essential to keeping the fledgling American system moving in the right direction then and now. “The reason our government has been successful all of these years are the checks and balances between the different branches. We need to hold on to that.”
He drew from history again to talk about another concern. Because even judges are human beings, they will make mistakes (and have made some that many of us could list). The question is: Will they be able to fix them? Shah raises as an example of how mistakes by the judicial system can be fixed, the Dred Scott decision, or Dred Scott v. Sandford, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1857 that slavery was OK. 
That decision, considered by many to be the worst ever from the Supreme Court, was overturned by the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery and declared all persons born in the United States to be U.S. citizens, with the same rights. In other words: birthright citizenship, which is currently being debated again in the courts. 
Shah said he thinks the courts are being serious and sober about their role right now, but like the others I interviewed, he’s worried about the tone of political debate affecting the courts and our system of government more generally.
“I wonder what will happen in the future if the amplified voices help people forget the importance of checks and balances,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

(Screengrab via Uthmeier's X account)Last week, Florida’s recently appointed attorney general, James Uthmeier, announced that he had a pretty snazzy idea: Build the state’s biggest immigrant detention center in the middle of the Everglades and call it “Alligator Alcatraz.” (Presumably “Gator Guantánamo” was already taken.)
“You don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there’s not that much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons,” Uthmeier said in a video he posted on X. “Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.”
I predict Uthmeier’s next brainstorm will call for transforming Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ historic home in Coconut Grove into a big public urinal. For toilet paper, he will no doubt provide copies of Florida’s Government in the Sunshine Law.
This week the state began building the prison, rushing the project while ducking questions the same way Gov. Ron DeSantis tried to duck the public last year while rushing construction of golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts in state parks.
The official designation for the detention site is TNT, by the way — the governor should take care that this project doesn’t blow up in his face like his parks plan did.)
As with the failed state parks scheme, pretty much every environmental group in Florida has been screaming bloody murder about it. Watching them reminded me of that scene in “Airplane!” when everyone lines up for a turn to slap one hysterical passenger. It’s clear they’d like to give Uthmeier the same treatment, along with the guy who appointed him.

Hundreds of people turned out Sunday afternoon for a protest at the site off U.S. 41, waving signs that said things like “NO ICE IN THE EVERGLADES.” Even as they protested, though, they could see work was already starting.

The crowd of protesters included Miccosukee tribal elder Betty Osceola, acclaimed nature photographer Clyde Butcher, often called “the Ansel Adams of Florida,” and the daughter of a legendary NFL quarterback who helped lead opposition to DeSantis’ golf course ploy.
This protest “was less about the kind of facility and more about the location of the facility,” said Jessica Namath, daughter of “Broadway Joe” Namath. “I mean, is anything sacred anymore?”
Namath wasn’t just talking about the fact that the Miccosukee Tribe opposes the prison because it’s adjacent to land the tribe regards as sacred. No, the site Uthmeier and DeSantis have picked for their Alligator Alcatraz happens to be one of the most holy places in Florida’s environmental history.
That lonely 10,500-foot-long airstrip is the reason Big Cypress National Preserve exists all around it. It’s the reason writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas became, at age 79, an environmental crusader for the rest of her 108 years of life.
 It’s the place where Miami officials tried to build the world’s largest jetport. They figured that by putting it in the middle of a swamp, no angry neighbors would object.
Boy, were they wrong.
 ‘A new city’
In 1968, the Dade County Port Authority acquired a 39-square mile parcel just six miles north of Everglades National Park and laid out plans for runways six miles long where jets would take off every minute.
For easy access to the site from either side of Florida, they proposed new interstate highway and a high-speed transit system (this is where fans of “The Simpsons” should start chanting, “Monorail!”). There would even be a “recreational waterway” for airboats.
Authority officials saw this massive investment of tax dollars as a way to set off an explosion of private development in what they viewed as a soggy and valueless land.
“A new city is going to rise up in the middle of Florida,” the authority chairman boasted.
Imagine his surprise when an odd coalition formed to oppose this supposedly foolproof plan. Hunters, anglers, high school students, Native Americans, and birdwatchers all said, “Whoa, that’s a terrible idea!”
Thriller writer and Sarasota resident John D. MacDonald even weighed in, writing in “Life” magazine that the jetport would “kill what was left of the Everglades.”
The most politically savvy opponent, Joe Browder, approached Douglas about joining the fight. After all, she’d written THE book on the Everglades. Surely, she wanted to save it.
She demurred, telling Browder nobody would listen to a half-blind old lady like her. They would only pay attention to organizations.
“Well,” Browder asked, “why don’t you start an organization?”
Together, Douglas and Browder founded Friends of the Everglades. (Yes, that venerable organization is in the thick of the current fight too.)
  Marjory Stoneman Douglas via Florida State Archives
“It was that project that drove Marjory into the ranks of active environmentalists,” said Jack Davis, who wrote the definitive biography of this Florida icon.
She knew that the Everglades wasn’t just vital habitat for panthers and gators, Davis said: “She knew that the Everglades recharges the Biscayne Aquifer where South Florida gets its water supply. She made the connection between the ecological health of the Everglades and the quality of human life in South Florida.”
This week, when Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava wrote to state officials posing lots of questions about the Alligator Alcatraz project, she brought that up too: “As a longtime champion of our Everglades and clean drinking water, I am committed to ensuring we continue to provide bipartisan protections for our greatest natural resource.”
Douglas’ greatest ally turned out to be science with a capital S. But, as has often happened during the DeSantis administration, science seems to be getting short shrift this time around.
 The first impact statement
To gauge the ramifications of building a giant jetport in the Everglades, a team from the U.S. Geological Survey put together the nation’s first environmental impact statement.
They were led by a senior scientist named Luna Leopold, the son of “A Sand County Almanac” author Aldo Leopold.
Their analysis found that the jetport would produce 4 million gallons of sewage and 1.5 million gallons of industrial waste every day, plus scatter 10,000 tons of air pollution across the natural landscape. When you added in all the related development, the numbers ballooned.
Nathaniel Reed, then a top aide to Gov. Claude Kirk, used the USGS report to convince his boss to withdraw the state’s support. That led to President Richard Nixon canceling federal support too, which ended the jetport before it got off the ground.
Then, under Nixon’s successor, Gerald Ford, the feds spent $150 million to buy up Big Cypress and turn it into the nation’s first-ever preserve.
Thus, we can thank three Republican politicians — Kirk, Nixon, and Ford — for halting the jetport and preserving a big swamp, Davis pointed out.
But that pro-conservation Republican Party seems to be a thing of the past now.
 Crossing his fingers
The first thing most people knew about this push for a big detention center in our most famous marsh came June 19, when Uthmeier posted about it on X.
That’s hardly the proper forum for alerting the public to a major Florida land-use change, but apparently that’s DeSantis’ preferred method.
Uthmeier’s post emphasized the lonely airstrip, calling it “an old, virtually abandoned facility” that could be used for flying detainees in and out.
Actually, the only thing that’s been abandoned is the pretense that DeSantis cares about fixing the Everglades.
“I’m proud to keep advancing these efforts in Everglades restoration and water quality, which will have lasting benefits to our state for years to come,” he said six months ago. Guess he had his fingers crossed when he spoke those words.
On Wednesday, in his first public comments on the Alligator Alcatraz controversy, DeSantis insisted that adding so many humans and manmade infrastructure to the Everglades will have “zero effect” on the River of Grass, and insisted all the environmental groups and others objecting to the project were just using it as a pretext because they disagree with his anti-immigration stance.
This isn’t just an environmental concern. Last year, the state and federal government earmarked more than $1 billion for restoring the River of Grass, on top of the $5 billion or so spent over the past 20 years. That’s all wasted taxpayer money now, poured down a really big drain.
A study last week found that a healthy Everglades is worth more than $31 billion to the South Florida economy every year. Real estate, tourism, fisheries, and recreation all benefit, the study reported.
Sorry folks, DeSantis is saying, we only support the lock-em-up business now. We can’t do anything to help other Everglades-related industries.
If this DeSantis scheme is disastrous for you, perhaps you can apply to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help — assuming FEMA still exists.
 Tents in hurricane season
Speaking of FEMA, how about that brilliant plan to house more than 1,000 detainees (plus all their guards) in tents and trailers in a remote area with a single road in and out during hurricane season.
And on property that, according to the Miami mayor’s letter, consists of 96% wetlands.
This turned into the topic of a lively discussion at this week’s Collier County Commission meeting.
Although the airstrip has belonged to Miami-Dade for decades, the detention center sits in Collier. The commissioners made it plain they’d been blindsided by the state like everyone else and wanted nothing to do with whatever happens when the next Ian storms ashore.
  Collier County Commissioner Rick LoCastro, via Collier County website
“Sitting here in the middle of hurricane season, I sure would hate to see this plop in our lap,” Commissioner Rick LoCastro said. “A thousand detainees that were sitting in tents [and] now need food, shelter, transportation, and all that.”
“You’re spot on, because even [the land] in between the taxiways is quite low and quite wet,” agreed county emergency management director Dan Sherman. “The contractors are going to have their hands full with anything temporary, even on a good day during the rainy season.”
Hey, maybe the contractors building the site are using undocumented immigrants for all the hot and sweaty construction work. After all, that’s the way we do construction here in Florida.
 Environmental harm
Sherman told the Collier commissioners that state officials had first visited the airstrip in February, but didn’t tell anyone what they were up to.
“It’s a location we’ve been looking at with law enforcement for a while,” Uthmeier told right-wing podcaster Benny “I Swear I Didn’t Know I Was Being Paid Handsomely for Spreading Russian Propaganda” Johnson this week.
He called the swampy site a low-cost alternative to an actual prison and bragged, “As of this morning, the federal government has approved our detention facility plan. … We’ll have 5,000 beds out there by early July.”
Uthmeier didn’t mention anything about consulting environmental experts about the prison’s effect on the Everglades. It’s too bad, because there are likely to be plenty.
  Eve Samples, via Friends of the Everglades
“Negative environmental impacts would include wetland degradation, building construction (even if temporary), water and sewer facilities, light pollution, traffic and emergency services,” Eve Samples, the current executive director of Friends of the Everglades, wrote in a letter to DeSantis. So far, he hasn’t responded, and I bet he never will.
  Kevin Guthrie via Florida Division of Environmental Management
The letter that state Emergency Management Division Director Kevin Guthrie sent to Miami-Dade and Collier officials over the weekend doesn’t mention any of that stuff. Instead, it simply urges the two counties to “work collaboratively … to complete the transaction in an expedient manner.”
The letter shows Guthrie failed to do his homework. He didn’t know who the Collier commission chair was, or that Collier had no claim on the airstrip. He also thought $20 million would be a good price for the property, apparently unaware that recent appraisals said it’s worth $190 million.
Instead of negotiating, the state just swooped in and seized the property on Monday. As justification, Guthrie cited a two-year-old emergency declaration from DeSantis that claimed immigrants are a dire threat to the state — not the boon that farmers, construction companies, and hotel managers know them to be.
The premise of our huge state and federal immigration crackdown — 3,000 arrests a day! — is the implied promise that the detainees will be evil drug dealers, human traffickers, and violent gangbangers. Instead, we’re seeing ICE scoop up an evangelical pastor in Wimauma, a breast-feeding mom in Orlando, and even a born-in-America U.S. citizen in Leon County.
Now picture those poor folks having to sleep in a tent in the Everglades in the heat of summer, fending off skeeters while squishing through the mud to use a Port-A-Potty, fleeing in terror as a hurricane bears down.
Fortunately, I think the opponents of this Gator Gulag have a secret weapon to stop it.
It’s Uthmeier.

 Mr. Oopsie-Daisy
No one voted for Uthmeier. DeSantis appointed him attorney general to reward him for doing such a bang-up job running the governor’s failed presidential campaign.
In his short time in office, he’s already earned the dubious distinction of being the only Florida attorney general to be found in contempt of court.
He also did such a terrific job running the campaign to defeat the ballot initiative to legalize weed that he embroiled both DeSantis and his wife in the Hope Florida scandal (or as I like to call it, “Hope Florida Doesn’t Notice”). One Florida House Republican even accused Uthmeier of fraud and money laundering, and now there’s a criminal investigation.
Before that, as DeSantis’ chief of staff, Uthmeier coordinated the program that fooled asylum-seekers in Texas into boarding taxpayer-funded flights to Martha’s Vineyard. That stunt backfired spectacularly when those immigrants were granted visas as crime victims.
My point is that Uthmeier has been a colossal jinx for DeSantis. He’s a human whoopie cushion, a pratfall waiting to happen. I’m surprised his nickname isn’t “Oopsie-Daisy” Uthmeier.
Who knows? With his track record, maybe we’ll accidentally wind up with enough money to fully restore the Everglades the way we’ve been trying to do for 25 years. I think Marjory would like that.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dade-County-airstrip-in-Ochopee-via-screen-grab-from-Uthmeiers-X-account-1024x501.png,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The Democratic Attorneys General Association is putting big money behind Jay Jones, announcing Thursday a $1 million investment in his campaign to flip Virginia’s attorney general seat and restore Democratic control of the office.
“Jones is a committed public servant who has always put his constituents and their rights first, which is why DAGA is excited to make this early investment to flip the seat back to blue,” the group said in a statement.
The high-dollar move came just one day after the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), the party’s national arm for state legislative races, announced a $400,000 boost to Democratic House of Delegates candidates and a new wave of endorsements in competitive districts. 
The back-to-back funding announcements signal a coordinated national effort to reclaim power in Virginia, where Republicans currently hold all three statewide offices and Democrats remain in control of both chambers of the legislature. 
DAGA President Sean Rankin said the time to act is now, casting Jones as a critical check on recent Republican policies, particularly those of President Donald Trump. 
“Virginia needs an attorney general like Jones who will hold Trump accountable for his unlawful actions,” Rankin said. “Jay Jones is running a campaign to defend democracy and fight for Virginia families, and we are confident he will deliver for the commonwealth as the next attorney general.”
With “so much at stake,” Rankin added, “it’s vital we take back this seat in November, and we’re committed to working with Jones to make that happen.”
Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk and the son of the late Judge Jerrauld C. Jones, won the Democratic nomination last week after narrowly defeating Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor in a hard-fought primary. 
The victory marked a political comeback for Jones, who previously lost the 2021 Democratic nomination for attorney general to then-incumbent Mark Herring. In November, Jones hopes to unseat Republican Jason Miyares.
A graduate of UVA and the University of Virginia School of Law, Jones has focused his campaign on reproductive rights, voting access, criminal justice reform and standing up to what he describes as “an increasingly extreme Republican agenda” at both the state and federal levels. He has said that Virginia’s next attorney general must be prepared to challenge legal efforts to roll back civil liberties and democratic protections.
The $1 million investment is one of the largest early commitments DAGA has made this cycle and underscores the strategic importance of the Virginia race. Attorney general contests have become a national battleground for policy fights ranging from abortion and gun rights to election law and corporate regulation.
Meanwhile, the DLCC’s newly endorsed candidates include Lindsey Dougherty, who’s challenging Republican Del. Carrie Coyner in the 75th District; Leslie Mehta, taking on Del. Mark Earley Jr. in the 89th; May Nivar, running against Del. David Owen in the 57th; and Kacey Robins Carnegie, vying for an open seat in Hampton Roads after GOP Del. Baxter Ennis opted not to seek re-election.
All four won their primaries last week and are now seen as key players in the battle for control of the House. The DLCC described the candidates as part of a broader strategy to “move Virginia forward” and flip seats Democrats narrowly lost in previous cycles.
Virginia’s 2025 election is shaping up to be a high-stakes test for both parties, with all three statewide offices — governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general — on the ballot, alongside the entire 100-member House of Delegates. 
With national figures and outside money pouring into the commonwealth, the contests are likely to preview messaging and strategy ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Twelve jurors had found Marvin Rice guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend. But they could not unanimously agree on whether he should live or die. Missouri is one of two states where a judge gets the final say when jurors can’t agree on the punishment — even when they vote 11 to 1 for life, as they had in Rice’s case.
He then sentenced Rice to death.
“It was a very lonely and daunting position to be in,” Parker, now a defense attorney in south-central Missouri, told The Marshall Project – St. Louis recently.

Defendants were previously sentenced to life without parole when Missouri jurors deadlocked in a capital case. That’s the default most states with the death penalty use today. A few conduct a new penalty phase. Since Missouri changed its law in 1984, Rice is one of at least 18 people who have been sentenced to death by a judge. Four of them have been executed. 
Missouri is an outlier in allowing judges to impose death. Some say judges have a better legal understanding of the death penalty than juries and argue that some crimes are so heinous that death is appropriate even when a jury isn’t unanimous. Opponents say the process undermines the importance of juries and that one person should not decide life or death. They also say the way Missouri’s statute is written is unconstitutional. 
“It is an issue that remains an issue,” said Robert Dunham, an attorney and director of the Death Penalty Policy Project.
There’s also a racial component when it comes to the death penalty in Missouri. Of the 18 people sentenced by judges, 11 — or 61% — were Black. Forty-one percent of all the defendants sent to death row in the state were Black, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center. That is dramatically disproportionate in a state where 11.7% of the population is Black, according to U.S. Census data.
Rice was later resentenced to life without parole on account of other violations in his case, including comments from the prosecution that infringed on Rice’s Fifth Amendment rights referencing his decision not to testify. 
 From death row to life

The jury in Joseph Whitfield’s 1994 trial in St. Louis also voted 11 to 1 for life in prison without parole. 
Whitfield’s life was spared after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Ring v. Arizona, which ruled in 2002 that only a jury can decide on facts necessary to impose the death penalty. In Whitfield’s case, the Missouri Supreme Court said jurors must first agree on two categories of facts to impose death: the presence of an aggravating circumstance and that it outweighs any mitigating factors. These steps would continue to be a source of legal disputes in life-or-death decisions for years to come.
In the third and final step, the so-called mercy step, jurors decide if they still want to impose death. That can be carried out by jurors or, if they cannot agree, a judge. 
In several Missouri cases where a judge had been the decider, it wasn’t clear where jurors hit a roadblock in the process or what aggravators and mitigators they had discussed.
Execution date set for man sentenced to die by a Missouri judge over 2005 murder

Eleven of the 18 judge-imposed death sentences have been changed to life. Most were a cascading consequence of Ring and Missouri’s subsequent decision for Whitfield, who died in prison on May 26 at age 85, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections. 
Among them was Deandra Buchanan. In March 2002, he was found guilty of fatally shooting his aunt, girlfriend and stepfather. The jury could not agree on a sentence. 
The judge handed down death.
He was resentenced to life without parole by the Missouri Supreme Court in the wake of the Ring decision. He was not present when the court revisited his case. In September 2024, public defender Tyler Coyle filed a motion arguing Buchanan’s life sentence was invalid because he had a right to be in court. 
A judge denied the motion on June 16. Coyle said he will appeal. 
 A recent execution

Amber McLaughlin was sentenced to death by St. Louis County Circuit Judge Steven Goldman in November 2006. McLaughlin became the first openly transgender person to be executed in the U.S. when she died by lethal injection on Jan. 3, 2023. 
Before becoming a judge, Goldman — then a prosecutor — helped devise the law that gave judges the power to impose death sentences.
Other states have moved to limit judicial death sentences. In a 2016 decision from the Supreme Court of Delaware, the justices said the state’s capital punishment statute was unconstitutional because it allowed judges to make findings on the aggravating circumstances and weigh those against mitigators. The ruling ended the death penalty in Delaware. Only Missouri and Indiana continue to permit a judge to impose death when a jury is hung. Indiana is less active when it comes to capital punishment, having executed 15 people since 2000. Missouri has executed 60, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center.
Goldman said judges have more familiarity with the death penalty. 
“I think judges are well qualified to do it, probably more so than juries in that regard,” he said. 
Retired Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff said the right to a jury trial is fundamental. 
“Especially in death penalty cases, but in every case that jurors hear, the jury is, among other things, a conscience of the community,” Wolff said. 
As McLaughlin’s execution date approached, Wolff and six retired circuit judges wrote to then-Gov. Mike Parson, urging him to commute McLaughlin’s sentence to life without parole. They said her sentence had been reversed in 2016 because her trial attorney failed to present information about her mental health. That mitigating evidence could have tipped the scales when the jury couldn’t agree. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals later overturned the 2016 decision. 
When Goldman sentenced McLaughlin, he acknowledged there were conflicting rules and said it wasn’t clear what mitigating circumstances were considered by the jury, according to court transcripts. 
Larry Komp, a federal public defender who represented McLaughlin in her appeals, said he didn’t think the court’s actions were constitutional. 
“But I guess it is in Missouri,” he said. 
The Missouri Supreme Court itself has noted the importance of juries in death penalty cases. In denying a stay for Kevin Johnson before he was executed in 2022, the court emphasized that the jury had found the aggravators, weighed them and decided on death. 
If officials genuinely believed in juries, Komp said, “Amber wouldn’t have been executed.” 
 Waiting on death row

Missouri has cleared much of its death row, primarily through a steady stream of executions that picked up as the pandemic waned. The state carried out four executions in 2023 and another four in 2024. Craig Wood, 57, and Lance Shockley, 48, are two of the eight people remaining. Both were sentenced by judges. 
During an appeal in Wood’s case, the Missouri Supreme Court backtracked on the three-step process juries go through. Now, a jury only has to unanimously agree on the presence of an aggravator.
Several attorneys said they doubt questions about the process authorizing judge-imposed death sentences would be taken up by the courts again. That leaves it up to the Missouri Legislature. 
In the past eight years, at least 14 pieces of legislation were drafted to repeal the law allowing judges to impose the death penalty. Most were sponsored by Republicans. 
Another bill to repeal the law got a hearing this year in the Senate, where it was debated for over 90 minutes. It was sponsored by state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold.
“It is my firm belief that one person in the state of Missouri should not hold the power of the state to kill somebody,” she said during Senate debate. 
The bill died.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250620_Kim_STL-JUDGE-DEATH-PENALTY_header-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

Get rid of states? Legal scholar Stephen Legomsky, who taught for 34 years at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, has just published a book, “Reimagining the American Union,” that proposes a radical idea: Abolish state government. The Conversation’s politics and democracy editor, Naomi Schalit – a former statehouse reporter herself – interviewed Legomsky about the provocative idea behind his book, in which he advocates moving most of the functions of state government down to the local level, closer to those represented and governed by it.
 You propose abolishing states. Why?

The book is a thought experiment. The proposal I’m offering is long term. I realize we need states during the current political moment.
I think the states are the root cause of many, if not most, of the current dangers faced by U.S. democracy. I also see the states as a significant source of fiscal waste. We don’t need three levels of government – national, state and local – all regulating us and all taxing us. Two would do just fine. And after careful, detailed analysis, I concluded that every benefit ever claimed for state government could be achieved at least as well, and in many cases better, by the local governments.
 I’m imagining the framers sitting in Independence Hall. And you go back in time and suggest to them not having states. I think most of them would drop dead at the thought, because it ultimately implies a much more powerful federal government. What would you say to them?

After they stop laughing, I would emphasize that I’m not proposing a wholesale transfer of power from the states to an all-powerful, all-knowing central government. Yes, some of the functions currently performed by the states could better be performed at the national level, but I’m proposing that the lion’s share devolve down to the local governments, which are even closer to the people they represent than the state legislatures can ever be.
Some of the most ardent Federalists, including Alexander Hamilton and James Wilson, referred to the states as “artificial beings” or “imaginary beings.” They accepted the states only because keeping them was politically essential to getting the required nine state ratifications, not because they thought states were a good idea.
 What functions would your plan hand over to the federal government?

A prime example is licensing. I looked up all the different occupations that require state licenses. I was astonished: practically every health care profession, barbers, engineers, lawyers, architects, the list is endless.
If you live near a state line, you can’t practice in both states unless you get two licenses. If you move to another state, you have to get another license. This seems silly. The human anatomy, human hair, engineering principles, don’t change as you cross from New York to New Jersey. Nor do we need 50 different state driver’s licenses; a single national license administered through local agencies would be more efficient.
 You say states are the root cause of the greatest threats to American democracy. What are those threats?

The structural threats are those that are baked into the Constitution itself. The Electoral College is one. On five occasions, the Electoral College has awarded the presidency to the candidate whom the voters rejected nationwide. And there were many, many near misses where the popular vote loser almost became president, making many such future instances a statistical certainty.
Perhaps even more important, every state, no matter how large or how small, gets the same number of U.S. senators. In fact, a majority of the U.S. population is represented by only about 18% of the Senate. The minority gets the other 82%.
These counter-majoritarian defects in the elections of both presidents and senators have a ripple effect. They skew the composition, and thus the decisions, of the federal courts. Three of the current Supreme Court justices were appointed by President Donald Trump after he had lost the national popular vote; five of the current Supreme Court justices were confirmed by senators who collectively represented only a minority of the U.S. population.
Here’s one especially jarring statistic: From 1969 until today, the Democratic presidential nominees won the national popular vote in a slight majority of the elections. Yet, during the presidential terms that resulted from those elections, Republican presidents have gotten to make 15 of the 20 Supreme Court appointments.
The Constitution also gives the states broad powers to regulate and run national elections. State legislatures have used those powers to pass gerrymandering, voter suppression and other counter-majoritarian laws.
 If you devolve these functions and services to localities, wouldn’t you end up with a mirror of the current state-level structure? Wouldn’t this just send a lot of state personnel down to the local level?

Yes, much of that structure would devolve. However, I see that as a good thing. Devolution is unavoidable in a country this size. Not everything can be done by the central government. The question for me is, do we need two levels of subordinate political subdivisions or one? One seems more efficient. And when problems are too big for one local government to handle on its own, it can partner with other local governments or with the national government, just as many local governments do today.
 If there were no states to gerrymander or pass voter-suppression laws, wouldn’t some national government agency just do it instead?

Redistricting would be performed by a nonpartisan redistricting commission that I propose be made up of technicians, mainly demographers, statisticians and geographers, under broad, general principles enacted by Congress. That’s what almost every other democracy in the world does today.
 Why did you write this book?

For a long time, I’ve been distressed about so many of the dangers to our democracy. So, one day, I found myself compiling what ended up becoming a fairly long mental list of all of my democracy-related grievances.
 A list of grievances like in the Declaration of Independence!

That’s a nice analogy. And as I thought about that list, it suddenly struck me that the vast majority of these problems couldn’t occur without states. That got me thinking about whether we really need states in the first place.
 If it’s just a thought experiment, something that’s not going to happen, why would you think it’s worthwhile spending time writing this?

And why would I be so vain as to think anybody would want to waste their time reading it?
 And your answer is, ‘Because I’m an academic!’

It’s that, plus more. I do hope there’s some scholarly value in this. But I’m also writing for the long term. States are secure for now, but history teaches us that the more distant future is full of surprises.

Steve Daines (R-Montana) speaks at a rally in Bozeman in support of Senate candidate Tim Sheehy and former President Donald Trump on Aug. 9, 2024. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montanans cherish our wide-open spaces because they are the backbone of our economy, the spectacular beauty that makes Montana special, and the shared birthright of every American.

So when Sen. Steve Daines quietly collaborated with Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to slip an amendment into the so-called “big beautiful bill” that would have forced the sale of as many as 3 million acres of public land and opened approximately 250 million more to auction, they weren’t proposing “budget savings.” They were engineering the largest transfer of wealth from taxpayers to wealthy private interests in American history.

Daines proudly messaged Montana would be exempt—knowing another member of Congress could add it back in at any time. His office never produced a single safeguard to prevent it. Make no mistake: Daines signed off on a plan to slice up America’s outdoor legacy for hedge funds, developers and foreign mining conglomerates.

Only after after a wave of public outrage from wildlife and land conservationists, hikers, campers, anglers, hunters, and recreation businesses and the Senate Parliamentarian ruled the amendment extraneous under the Byrd Rule—did Daines reverse course. This was not an act of accountability. It was damage control. Had the parliamentarian ruled the other way—or had the scheme remained under the radar—Daines would have proceeded with his scheme.

Equally troubling is Sen. Tim Sheehy’s complicity.

While Montanans flooded phone lines to protect our lands, Sheehy only offered support for the broader bill. His failure to promptly oppose Daines’ land-sale scheme speaks volumes about where he stands when corporate donors clash with Montana’s values and economy.

The amendment would have erased habitat for wolves, elk, wolverines, grizzlies, Canada lynx, and hundreds of other species, and fast-tracked drilling and logging. It would have undercut an economy that depends on healthy, accessible landscape that generates billions annually. Every acre siphoned into private hands would be one less for the average camper, hunter or mountain biker seeking solitude under big skies.

Daines hopes voters will only blame Sen. Lee. But Montanans—and all Americans who treasure public lands—must never forget or forgive his egregious co-authorship to liquidate the public trust. Trust is earned through consistent action based on values, not reversals and rewritten press releases. If Daines and Lee find a loophole to the Byrd Rule, the next land-grab could appear at 2 a.m. on the last pages of a must-pass bill.

Moving forward we must demand permanent protections. Congress must pass legislation with a clear and permanent “no-sale” clause for our public lands—no loopholes, no carve-outs. Public lands, no matter their location, belong to all of us.

We must also hold Daines and Sheehy accountable. Don’t let Daines off the hook for co-authoring a massive public land giveaway. Don’t forget Sheehy’s attempt to distract from his complicity by pointing to Montana’s temporary carve-out—while still praising the amended bill.

If ever there was a time to support conservation groups, it’s now. We are out-funded by special interest dark money groups and their lobbyists. Keep calling, writing, and showing up. Politicians count on our exhaustion. Prove them wrong.

Public lands are our inheritance. The BBB land-sale fiasco showed just how close we came to losing them. Vigilance and public outcry defeated greed this time. Let’s make sure Senators like Daines and Sheehy—beholden to the wealthy and special interests—never get another chance to steal our land from us again.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
 Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.










The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares


“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
 Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.
Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
 Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.
“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin is calling on the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office to reconsider plans to adopt the use of facial recognition technology. Like the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), the sheriff’s office is considering acquiring facial recognition technology from the company Biometrica. The company has offered MPD free access in exchange for 2.5 million images, jail records, and other related data of people who have passed through Milwaukee’s criminal justice system, including many who presumably haven’t been convicted of a crime. 
“Given all the public opposition we’ve seen to the Milwaukee Police Department’s push to expand their use of facial recognition, the news of the Sheriffs office’s interest in acquiring this technology is deeply concerning,” Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director for the ACLU of Wisconsin, wrote in a statement for an ACLU press release. “Law enforcement’s use of facial recognition software poses a number of serious threats to civil rights and civil liberties, making it dangerous both when it fails and when it functions.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Just days ago, Milwaukee County Sheriff Denita Ball revealed that her office was looking into adopting facial recognition software. Ball told county supervisors during a June 17 meeting of the Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and General Services Committee Urban Milwaukee reported, that she was assessing a data-sharing agreement for the technology. MCSO did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Like MPD, the sheriff’s office is exploring an agreement with Biometrica, a company which has pushed back against concerns about privacy and the use of its surveillance tools. Biometrica offers a third-party facial recognition algorithm to agencies like the Milwaukee police and the sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office states that rather than using the technology for untargeted surveillance, it aims to use facial recognition software to identify people once investigators have an image of a criminal suspect. Ball says that facial recognition would never be the sole basis for an arrest or charges, Urban Milwaukee reported.
On Thursday, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors will vote on a resolution requiring the creation of a regulatory process for adopting facial recognition technology. Both at the county and city government meetings, however, law enforcement agencies have been met with public skepticism about their exploration of facial recognition technologies. 
Tension bubbled up during a hearing before the Milwaukee Equal Rights Commission last week. Police department Inspector Paul Lough  said that facial recognition could provide important leads for investigations similar to those derived from confidential informants and information databases used to run names. During the hearing, MPD officials presented examples of cases in which facial recognition technology helped solve crimes. “Whether or not they would’ve…may or may not have been solved without the use of facial rec., it’s hard to say,” said Lough. “Some probably would have been, some might still be open. But the important part of it is that all of the ones that we’re going to go over are very predatory in nature where there’s exigent circumstances to solve them quickly.”

MPD Capt. James Hutchinson went over two investigations from March 2024 which utilized facial recognition technology. One involved a drive-by shooting, where a passing car opened fire on a pedestrian, who died on the scene. Hutchinson explained that MPD obtained images from surveillance cameras, which were then sent to partner agencies with the ability to run facial recognition requests. Within 16 hours, the police captain told the commission, a potential suspect had been identified. 
“We don’t know who they are when we get those pictures back, but we have ways of vetting that information, confirming the identification provided to us,” said Hutchinson. “And that’s what we did in this case.” Unique tattoos helped narrow the search to a man who was wearing a GPS bracelet. When officers went to conduct an arrest, they found two alleged shooters, their guns and the car they are believed to have used. Hutchinson said that a trial is pending for both suspects arrested in that case. 
Facial recognition was also used in a sexual assault case, which occurred two days before the shooting. A victim had been followed home in the rain by a man offering her his umbrella, and asking for money. He mentioned that he’d already tried asking for money at a nearby gas station. As they walked, he held a gun to her head and forced her into a garage where he assaulted her. Officers were able to locate the garage with the victim’s help using Google Maps, and later the gas station the man had mentioned before. Surveillance camera photos potentially capturing the man were sent to other agencies for facial recognition assistance, which came back with images of a man who was on probation for sexual assault. He was identified both by the probation agent and the victim, and was sentenced to 20 years of incarceration. 
MPD listed 13 additional cases where it used facial recognition, including a string of taco truck robberies on Milwaukee’s South Side involving a group of masked assailants. Although they appeared careful to cover their faces, one suspect let his mask down briefly, which was seen by a camera, and sent to a partner agency for identification. In that case, three to four potential suspects were identified by the technology, each with a certain percentage of certainty such as 97%, 95% and so on. After further investigation, detectives identified those responsible for the taco truck robberies as people flagged by the  facial recognition search with the lowest percentage of certainty.

During public testimony, several people expressed concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition technology. Facial recognition software has been shown to have trouble identifying non-white faces, and is prone to errors particularly when identifying people of color. Some feared that defendants might have trouble learning how facial recognition was used in their cases, and felt that police oversight was lacking. Others pointed to the 2.5 million images MPD would give to Biometrica in exchange for the software licenses, and argued that such a move would only further harm community trust in the police. Because the images include mugshots, it’s possible that people whose images were included in that transaction will not be convicted of a crime after being  arrested or detained at the jail for a period of time. Other questions included  what access federal agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), would have to MPD’s facial recognition system. 
“As we recently found, MPD has been using facial recognition technology on the faces of Milwaukeeans for years, without being transparent with the public or the FPC,” Krissie Fung, a member of the Milwaukee Turners and Milwaukee’s Fire and Police Commission (FPC), said during public testimony. “Because there’s no standard operating procedure to provide guidelines around their process, relying on MPD to follow their own gentlemen’s agreements and internal process is just not how oversight works.” 
Fung also said MPD Chief Jeffrey Norman acknowledged when he was reappointed that there is no way to guarantee the safety of the data and faces of Milwaukeeans, and that the data would be going to a third-party company the city does not oversee and which uses algorithms the city will not be able to  access. “MPD’s proposal is to trade 2.5 million mugshots in exchange for this license which, by the way, includes my mugshot,” said Fung. “I believe that there are serious legal concerns that have not yet played out in the courts, and that would open us up to significant lawsuits.”

“I cannot help but wonder if the reason Biometrica is so thirsty to trade 2.5 million ‘jail records or mugshots’ in exchange for free access to this technology, is that they assume that those jail records are Black faces, and they clearly need more Black faces to train their inaccurate algorithm,” Fung added. “But we don’t need to let them get those Black faces from Milwaukee.”
“I don’t know a single person in this city that trusts the police,” said Ron Jansen, who has testified about law enforcement at previous city and county meetings. “So the last thing Milwaukee needs to do is hand this department a tool that creates even greater opportunity to harm the people of this city.” 
“This is not free,” Jansen added.  “… the cost is 2.5 million mugshots of residents, non-residents, whatever. Anybody who’s been through the system here in Milwaukee…2.5 million human beings…Human beings, maybe half of which or more, were never convicted of a crime. This includes people who were wrongfully arrested, or accused, or just anyone who was ever booked into their custody. And while I was writing this, I thought, ‘that also includes people who’ve already been victimized by this department.’ People who have been beaten by the police. People who have been wrongfully accused by the police. This is your biological data, my biological data, everyone’s biological data, and it is being sold to a private company without your consent, all so that they can expand their surveillance network.” 
Jansen asserted that the millions of images could include protesters, teachers, even state Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who was wrongfully arrested by MPD during a curfew. “His arrest record is likely in there,” said Jansen. He also raised the 2025 case of officer Juwon Madlock, who used his access to police databases to pass intelligence about confidential informants and the home addresses of  targets to gangs searching out rivals. “If this is already happening, imagine what will happen when their abilities get expanded,” said Jansen.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Congress is trying to push the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” into law through a legislative shortcut known as reconciliation. At its root, reconciliation means restoring harmony, mending what’s broken, and finding common ground. 
In our personal lives, it’s a path toward healing. But in Congress, that word has been twisted.
It is now being used to force through legislation that would strip health care and food access from millions of Americans, including thousands of Oklahomans, with little debate, no bipartisan support, and devastating consequences for families.
The budget reconciliation process, created in 1974, was designed to fine-tune fiscal policy. It was never meant to serve as a backdoor for major policy changes. It was intended to be used sparingly to balance budgets, not to upend lives. But today, it is being exploited. The current reconciliation bill is being rushed through without transparency, accountability or consensus. And if passed, it will cause real harm right here in Oklahoma.
An estimated 15 million people nationwide could lose their health coverage. As many as 172,000 of them live in Oklahoma — a state already struggling with access to care and ranked near the bottom in health outcomes.
The bill could slash Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits at a time where inflation and food insecurity in our rural communities are spiking. It could end enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, making insurance unaffordable for working families and seniors. It would also gut Medicaid, a program nearly 1 in 4 Oklahomans depend on.
This is not fiscal responsibility. It is cruelty disguised as policy.
I’ve lived what many families are facing. I remember when my youngest daughter had the flu and needed antibiotics. Our Medicaid had just lapsed due to a paperwork issue. I was told it would take two weeks to reprocess. I sat in my car outside the pharmacy, torn between paying out of pocket for the prescription or keeping our electricity on.
I chose the medicine because, for my family, living without electricity is less harmful than living without medication. I’ll never forget the feeling of panic and helplessness from having to make that choice. But what happens in summertime extreme heat episodes when people need medicine and electricity to survive? There is no choice when living without either could mean death.
That’s the reality of poverty. It is not just numbers on a budget sheet. It is day-to-day survival. It means deciding between food and medication, between health and heat. 
These are not abstract policy outcomes. They are real decisions families are forced to make because lawmakers continue to choose politics over people.
The bitter irony is, Congress is using reconciliation to divide and dismantle instead of to heal. The very meaning of the word has been lost in the rush to pass harmful policies. There is nothing reconciliatory about cutting food and health care from families while handing tax breaks to the wealthy.
It’s important to reflect on why our Republican congressional representatives Stephanie Bice, Josh Brecheen, Tom Cole, Frank Lucas, and Kevin Hern chose to support a reconciliation bill that removes vital resources from the very communities they represent. 
As a lifelong Oklahoman, I am not just disappointed. I am disheartened. We elect our representatives to fight for us, not to turn a blind eye to our struggles. It is painful to see them back legislation that would cause real harm to the families and communities they swore to protect.
The bill is now in the Senate. Will senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin turn their backs on us or will they listen to the voices of their constituents, neighbors and church members who will feel the impact of this bill the most?
Oklahoma has a proud tradition built on the idea of community. We pride ourselves on the Oklahoma Standard, which is neighbors helping neighbors and showing up in times of need. After tornadoes and wildfires, we do not ask who deserves help. We simply give it. But no one, no matter how hardworking, can thrive when the basic supports are stripped away.
Cutting health care and food aid is not aligned with Oklahoma values. It is a betrayal of them.
Hopefully our Oklahoma delegation will choose to lead and show Washington what reconciliation should look like.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho can enforce a state law that bans children from receiving gender-affirming care.
For a few months in early 2024, a federal court injunction blocked Idaho from enforcing the state law for all children in Idaho. But in April 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the judicial block to only apply to the minors who sued over the law.
The lawsuit’s dismissal on June 18 ended judicial blocks, allowing Idaho to enforce the law, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office says.
“No one has the right to harm children,” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement. “For two years, my office defended Idaho’s common-sense law that protects kids from experimental procedures with lifelong, irreversible consequences.” 
The lawsuit was dismissed because the suing transgender minors moved out of state, ACLU of Idaho announced.

The same day as Idaho’s lawsuit was dismissed, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar state law in Tennessee, ruling that children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class, the Tennessee Lookout reported. 
“Idaho has done what it set out to do – drive out transgender people who don’t want to tolerate the unnecessary hostility toward them,” ACLU of Idaho Advocacy Fellow Jenna Damron said in a statement. “I wish I could say this ruling is surprising, but I’m not surprised. Still, I want every trans kid out there to know: You are loved. You are worthy. And we will keep fighting for you, no matter what this court says.”
Idaho doctors brace for impact on impending gender-affirming medication ban

Idaho’s law, passed in 2023, bans puberty blockers, hormones and surgical interventions for Idaho youth seeking gender-affirming care. But the law doesn’t ban all gender-affirming care for children, such as mental health services, hair removal, speech therapy, and period suppression. Idaho doctors previously told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
If doctors violate Idaho’s law, they could face a felony criminal charge. Surgeries were already not happening on minors in Idaho, the Sun previously reported.
The Alliance Defending Freedom, an influential conservative Christian law firm, helped represent Idaho in the lawsuit. Labrador and the law firm in 2023 signed an agreement to allow the firm to represent Idaho, for free, in litigation. 
ACLU of Idaho says it is still working on other lawsuits to protect trans rights, including challenges to Idaho’s law banning trans students from participating in sports teams of their same gender and against Idaho’s ban on using public funds for gender-affirming care, including in prisons.

(Getty Images)The charter school movement in Indiana is growing with a new option designed for rural families called microschools – each tailored to the community it serves. 
This fall, Eastern Hancock Schools in partnership with the Indiana Microschool Collaborative, will open Nature’s Gift Microschool — a small school located in the woods of Nameless Creek Youth Camp, about 30 miles east of Indianapolis. 
Collaborative board member Scott Bess, who is president and CEO of the Indiana Charter Innovation Center, said urban areas in Indiana have almost every option available for schools – traditional schools, charter schools or private schools. But suburbs and rural regions face limited choices, often forcing families to drive long distances or homeschool children, which is not always an option for everyone. 
“You can set up microschools in areas where you don’t need a 100,000 square foot building and all of the infrastructure,” Bess said. “You don’t need 400 students in places where the population wouldn’t support that.”
Nature’s Gift Microschool, in development for 18 months, welcomes K-12 students on a first-come, first-served application process. The school will operate as a public charter school, meaning it receives state and federal funding like any other public school. However, its small size and administration model allows more funding to go directly into the classroom, Bess said.
Indiana lawmakers passed more than two dozen K-12 education laws and funding changes in the state’s next two-year budget. 
Despite a statewide teacher shortage, Bess said teachers have been eager to join microschools and shown strong interest. He said many are drawn to the increased flexibility and the opportunity to work more closely with students. 
  Eastern Hancock Superintendent George Philhower
According to Bess, microschool teachers are not asked to prepare lesson plans every day and sit down with a group of 25 or more kids. Each classroom is multi-age, making the teacher more of a coach or facilitator. 
Eastern Hancock Superintendent George Philhower helped launch the microschool after speaking with local parents who opted out of sending their children to district schools. 
“The Indiana Microschool Collaborative is designed to give families more flexibility while ensuring students are still connected to a supportive school community. It’s one way we’re working to make education more personal, relevant, and responsive to the needs of students and families. We believe models like this can help Indiana better serve those who may not thrive in a traditional setting.” Philhower said. 
Bess said the goal of the IMC is to make all of the microschools hyper-local, driven by community demand. 
“This isn’t something where we’re going to say, hey, we’re going to open a new school in this community, and like no one asked for it, this is going to be more community, parent, student driven asking us, hey, we’d love to have you here,” Bess said. 
He said that in the next 10 years, they are expecting hundreds of microschools to open across the state. They are still collaborating with districts to find ways for students to participate in clubs or athletic programs since microschools will not have their own. 
This is not the first of its kind in Indiana. The Purdue Polytechnic High School Lab School opened in the fall 2023 in Indianapolis with about 20 students, and is among the dozen microschools across the state. 
“There’s no ‘this is exactly what a microschool is,’” Bess said. “In the following years under Indiana Microschool Collaborative they will all be different because the community they are serving is different. The students they are serving are different and the parents certainly are different.”

Due to shifting demographics, many Wyoming school districts are facing cuts to Title I funds for things like tutoring, professional development and kindergarten prep. 
The post Declining federal funds, late notice extinguish Ms. Paula’s preschool ‘magic’ appeared first on WyoFile .","At the head of a classroom in Lander, Paula Vincelette held up a small plastic pig and asked a dozen preschoolers to help the pig build a house with bricks. The students-turned-builders intently mimed the construction of small imaginary homes on the carpet in front of them. 
As Vincelette continued with the story of the “Three Little Pigs,” she paused often with prompts and questions. On cue, her rapt pupils enthusiastically repeated the famous tagline: “Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!!” 
It may have looked like a simple storytime, but Vincelette incorporated elements meant to prepare these children for the kindergarten classroom next year. Like constructing a house brick by brick, they were honing their listening skills and building vocabulary; learning how to raise their hands and speak in turn. Later, when she paired them up to build their own little story sets using actual props, they worked on sharing, body awareness and communication. 
As the early childhood education liaison for Fremont County School District 1, Vincelette has done this kind of work for five years. Along with direct instruction, she has also worked with child care providers and parents in her overarching goal to build better early childhood education foundations for district children. 
Her position, however, is coming to an end. The school district discovered late this spring that its 2025-26 federal Title I funds — which supplement state and local funding for low-achieving children — would be cut by roughly $86,000. Administrators made what they described as an extremely difficult choice to terminate the position.
Although the end of the early childhood education job comes amid a torrid of federal cuts fueled by President Donald Trump’s DOGE efforts, this one is unrelated. Title I funds are calculated based on demographics, specifically the number of children living in poverty. The number of Fremont County children living in poverty declined from 227 in the last cycle to 182 in this one, according to the Wyoming Department of Education. 
A similar demographic shift is occurring across much of the state. But what can on its face be interpreted as a positive trend had the downstream effect of reducing funding in most of Wyoming’s school districts. Notice from the federal government of decreases was months late, leaving many administrators scrambling after budgets were set. And, in places like Fremont County, it means an end to what many parents and supporters call a life-changing educational opportunity.

“Our family definitely benefited from Paula’s programs,” said Lander mom Amelia Decker. Decker started attending Vincelette’s free programs for families when her older son was a baby, received individual help when he was in preschool and enrolled him in the kindergarten transition session last summer. 
“Her advice, the space she offered for myself and other parents, and the learning opportunities about how to interact with my children shaped me as a mother and opened up so many connections for our family,” Decker said. 
In an era when educational experts say the role of early childhood education is crucial, many in Fremont County hope the district will be able to reinstate Vincelette’s position in the future. 
Census numbers and federal funds
The number of Wyoming children ages 5-17 living in poverty dropped between the 2022 and 2023 U.S. Census, the basis for calculating ‘25-26 Title I allocations. The number fell by nearly 700 children, from 11,420 to 10,731, according to WDE calculations. The state’s total population of children ages 5-17, meanwhile, remained relatively stable, barely budging from 98,774 to 98,764. But statewide public school enrollment has been falling for at least five years, a trend educators attribute to factors like more parents deciding to homeschool their children. 
The poverty-related shift resulted in a statewide drop of a little over $1 million for the federal Title I funds compared to the ‘24-25 school year, state figures indicate. 
Though it’s hard to say what specific mix of factors contributed to the trend in Wyoming, tax credits and stimulus payments in conjunction with relief programs were credited with the largest nationwide one-year drop in childhood poverty in 2021. 
Funding impacts for the incoming school year vary between districts. A decrease of 160 students in Natrona County District 1, for example, created a funding drop of roughly $63,000, and in Albany County School District 1, a decrease of 37 children living in poverty resulted in a loss of roughly $6,000. 
But in Teton County School District 1, the number of children in poverty increased from 134 to 153, which resulted in a funding bump of $307,000. The majority, however, will receive less Title I money. 
Fremont County School District’s Title I Coordinator Deidre Meyer’s job every year is “to look at our funding and see where this money is going to best serve our students under Title I,” she said.  


Under the federal regulations, Meyer noted, “the majority of the Title I funding for preschool is supposed to be spent on Head Start and [Community Development Services].”
Up until late May, she was operating under the assumption that the funding level was stable. But late that month, she received an email from the Wyoming Department of Education with the updated federal allocations. Those updates normally arrive by February. That’s when Meyer realized she would have significantly less to work with, she said. 
She attempted to move funds around, she said, but it wasn’t enough. Ultimately, she cut the early childhood liaison position because it was the option that affected the smallest number of students while still fulfilling the Title I grant requirements, she said. 
“It was very hard,” Meyer said. “It was a tough one.”
The timing only made it harder, FCSD1 Superintendent Mike Harris said. By the time the May 21 notification arrived, “our staffing decisions are pretty much done.” 
The tardiness, he said, “put a lot of districts in a tough spot. For those that are getting reduced funding now, they’re looking at their proposals and their projections, and they’re having to revise a lot.” 
It is unclear why the projections were so late this year, but the federal Department of Education has been in flux since the Trump administration laid off an estimated 1,400 employees this spring. That issue is tied up in litigation. 
A passion for early education 
It’s never a pleasant experience to learn you will no longer have a job, Vincelette said. Despite that, she had no ill words about the district and said she understood the difficult choice. 
Vincelette grew up in Rock Springs and pursued elementary education at the University of Wyoming. There, she studied under renowned UW professor Nikki Baldwin. 
“The way she taught was making you really think outside the box and push the quote-unquote standard of what we think early childhood should be,” Vincelette said. “I really connected with that.”
She also found inspiration in the deliberate and thoughtful curriculum at Laramie’s Early Care and Education Center, where her own two kids attended. 
Vincelette moved to Lander nine years ago to work as a preschool teacher for the school district. She transitioned to the early childhood education liaison five years ago, initially as part-time.

The position aimed to support the early childhood education landscape in a broader sense. To do that, Vincelette worked with local preschools and kindergarten classrooms to model and teach weekly lessons based on needs. She offered a free, weekly “Little Explorers” program for families with children under 5 to encourage learning and play. She advocated developmentally appropriate learning, worked with the family consumer science class at the high school and led the summer “Lights On” program for children about to enter kindergarten.
Vincelette is an adherent of evidence-based models, and a big part of her approach is learning through play. 
If educators present lessons “in a playful manner, students are going to remember that,” she said. Connecting it to joy and fun makes it more effective for small children, she said. 
She learns a lot from young children, she added, who have a purity, rawness and presence of mind she finds refreshing. 
It appears she has taken a page from that presence of mind in this situation. Instead of panicking about finding a new job, Vincelette said in the Lander classroom during a break in the summer pre-kindergarten program, she spent the final weeks of her job absorbed in the work.
‘Kid magic’
Back in the classroom, Vincelette’s way with kids was evident. Whether asking them to touch their ears while listening, telling the story with a toy wolf or asking them to place hands on top of their heads to show they were finished, she commanded their complete attention.  
Following story time, the children moved through play stations around the room — painting, handling fragile water beads, building with magnetic blocks, practicing handwriting with a magnetic “pen” among them. The stations were designed to help build things like motor skills, body awareness or language foundations, Vincelette said.

“Miss Paula has ‘kid magic,’” a local kindergarten teacher wrote in a testimonial after news broke that the position had been terminated. Vincelette collected a number of these in an effort to provide proof of how impactful the work has been. She hopes funding will be available in the future to support the reinstatement of something similar. 
Supporters hope so too. In the pages of testimonials, kindergarten teachers, preschool directors, parents and mentees praised her singular talent with small children during an era when evidence of the importance of early childhood education on long-term outcomes of success is mounting.
They credited Vincelette with quelling behavioral issues and igniting imagination, equipping parents with tools to encourage learning-based play at home, transforming teachers’ approach to instruction and easing transition into the classroom for all kids, including those who didn’t attend daycare or preschool.  
“Her absence will be profoundly felt by students, teachers, and families alike,” another teacher wrote. 
Decker, the Lander mom, recently watched her son finish kindergarten. While he has his ups and downs, she said, “he is thriving academically and as a person. I credit so much of that to Ms. Paula.”

Legislators mull increasing Medicaid payments, enhancing provider recruitment programs and other potential remedies.
The post Births fall in Wyoming hospitals as lawmakers study maternity care gaps appeared first on WyoFile .","Births continue to fall in many Wyoming hospitals as lawmakers seek remedies for widening gaps in maternity care across the state. 
Hospitals in Casper, Cheyenne, Rock Springs, Cody, Douglas and Lander are seeing declining deliveries, data from the Legislative Service Office shows. Four other hospitals — in Riverton, Kemmerer, Rawlins and most recently Evanston — have shut down birthing facilities entirely in recent years. When Evanston announced its closure at the end of 2024, it cited declining demand. 
Wyoming’s maternity gap issue appears to be most acute in Central Wyoming, according to Curtis Biggs, Gov. Mark Gordon’s senior policy advisor, where SageWest Hospital in Lander is the main birthing facility serving a huge area of Fremont and Sublette counties. 
“We are seeing a concerning trend of a decline in those births in that particular hospital, with a lot of births shifting to Thermopolis,” Biggs told the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health & Social Services Committee Monday. The latter hospital was the only one presented that has experienced a significant spike in deliveries.

A dearth of maternal health care has made pregnancy and childbirth increasingly tricky in widening swaths of Wyoming, a 2023 WyoFile investigation found. This is evident in Fremont County, where moms are opting to temporarily relocate to places like Denver and even the East Coast to deliver babies. It is evident in Rawlins, where families have to travel Interstate 80, a notorious stretch of highway that closes frequently in the winter months, to deliver in Laramie. And it is evident in Teton County, where overflow patients from elsewhere in the state are straining providers. 
Lawmakers made maternity care a top issue of study for the 2024 legislative off-season and began to identify a complicated mix of challenges for providing such care in rural places. 
Maternity care is back on the table this summer as policymakers work to improve doctor recruitment, regulations and a complex system of health care reimbursements. Despite some steps forward in the past year, as Biggs explained to lawmakers, the options for families seeking robust maternal health care remain scant or nonexistent in many parts of the state. 
The problem 
A Wyoming Health Department assessment found that nearly half of the state’s counties lacked a practicing OB-GYN in 2024. The State Scorecard on Women’s Health and Reproductive Care ranked Wyoming 42nd that same year. The state placed behind all of its neighbors.
Solutions have been elusive. Complicating the issue are provider challenges like low birth volume in rural areas, high costs of medical malpractice insurance, financial viability struggles for hospitals, abortion ban impacts on doctors, liability concerns and barriers for midwives to deliver in hospitals.

Along with the 2024 legislative committee study, the OB Subcommittee of Gov. Gordon’s Health Task Force also worked to explore solutions. That group narrowed its focus last summer to three areas: how to better utilize midwives, doulas and family physicians alongside obstetricians in delivery care; the possibility of creating OB medical fellowships to bolster care in Wyoming; and regionalizing the state’s maternity care.
The Joint Labor Committee took up the issue once more as an interim topic in 2025. During its two-day meeting this week in Casper, Deputy Director of the Wyoming Department of Health Franz Fuchs and Gordon’s policy advisor Biggs laid out the situation anew. 
“The primary problem we’re really diagnosing this with is hospital viability,” Fuchs said. “We believe that labor and delivery closures are really a symptom of broader financial stress on the hospitals, whether it’s due to low volume generally or management issues.”
That financial stress can come from a host of issues, he said, including low volume of births, management issues, nurse labor shortage and provider recruitment challenges, fewer women of childbearing age creating declining demand and comparatively low Medicaid payment rates. When stressed, hospitals look to offload services, he continued, and labor and delivery is an attractive candidate because it’s not profitable.  
Fuchs offered several options for aiding hospitals, including increasing Medicaid hospital payment rates for deliveries, increasing Medicaid payments to delivering providers, increasing funding for provider recruitment programs and increasing provider education opportunities or incentives for medical students. 
Other ideas that came up during the meeting were malpractice tort reform, mobile units that can travel to underserved areas and more oversight of the services local hospitals provide. 
Steps and directions 
Some steps have been taken to address the issue. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming is launching a program in July to support maternal health and respond to growing concerns about access to care. The Maternity Care Program will include a subscription service for prenatal vitamins and remote monitoring for high-risk pregnancies or those living in areas with little or no maternity care, among other services. 
Another step is a new OB residency track through the University of Wyoming Family Medicine Residency Program at Cheyenne. 
“We have residents selected that will be on an OB track starting in July when they start their second year, which means our real goal is for them either then to be able to get into an OB fellowship following residency, or  simply to go get a job, hopefully some place in the state,” said Dr. Jacques Beveridge, a Cheyenne OB-GYN. 
He also echoed a common sentiment when he urged lawmakers’ “favorable consideration of increasing Medicaid payment.”
As vice president of the Wyoming Hospital Association, Josh Hannes served on the governor’s health task force OB subcommittee.
If the committee is not OK with the current state of maternity care, Hannes said, “and where we believe it’s going to go if there’s no intervention, and you believe that the state has a role to play in doing better, then I think there’s a number of valuable recommendations that have been presented that could take bill form. We would be supportive of those.”
Ultimately, committee members voiced support for pursuing bills that would: help give midwives more authority to deliver; raise Medicaid reimbursements for obstetrics; offer protections for pregnancy resource centers; look into mobile health units; and study other states’ models for helping to pay for malpractice insurance.  
In addition, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, said she would like the health department to consider removing the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of recommended vaccines for pregnant women.

The Big Beautiful Bill will have some ugly consequences for health care costs in the Equality State, writes Nate Martin. 
The post Congress is about to hike up Wyoming’s health insurance costs appeared first on WyoFile .","The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is supposed to be all about tax breaks. 

Opinion

But the bill actually cancels a tax break that could skyrocket health insurance costs for tens of thousands of people in Wyoming and drive up prices for all of us.
Wyoming’s Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis love to talk about all the tax breaks that the Big Beautiful Bill is supposed to create. 
But they’re awfully quiet about getting rid of this one. 
As it’s written, the “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminates major tax credits that people in Wyoming use to buy private health insurance off the federal Healthcare Marketplace, via healthcare.gov.
By eliminating these tax credits, the bill would double, triple, or even quadruple the cost of insurance premiums many people in Wyoming pay. 
The result will be even tighter family budgets, more people without insurance, more medical debt, bankrupted hospitals, sicker communities, and a sicker workforce.
Currently, a single person earning $62,000 a year in Wyoming can buy a year’s worth of medical insurance for $5,270 thanks to Marketplace tax credits. If the Big Beautiful Bill eliminates those credits, that price will increase to $11,810, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
That’s more than double the cost. And that’s not the worst of it.
Older people in Wyoming who aren’t quite eligible for Medicare will see the biggest increases. 
Right now, a 60-year-old couple earning $80,000 a year together can buy health insurance from the Marketplace for $6,970 to cover both of them. 
Again, this is thanks to tax credits.
Under the Big Beautiful Bill, the cost will shoot up to $44,392 a year just for insurance premiums.
For most people nearing retirement, this cost will simply be impossible to pay.
Just shy of 40,000 people in Wyoming get their health insurance through the Marketplace, KFF Health News reported. 
These are mostly people who are self-employed or who work for small businesses that don’t offer job-based coverage, or they’re people who string together two or three part-time gigs. 
If you’ve never bought health insurance off the Marketplace — I did for years — what happens is that you select a plan from a private company, like Blue Cross Blue Shield, but you pay a lower price than you normally would as an individual customer. 
Your Marketplace tax credit covers the difference.
Americans have been eligible to buy health insurance with Marketplace tax credits since 2014. During the pandemic, Congress created “enhanced” tax credits that made insurance affordable for even more people.
These enhanced credits have been wildly popular in Wyoming. The number of people who got coverage with Marketplace tax credits in Wyoming increased by more than 75% since 2020, according to KFF Health News.
These “enhanced” credits are what the “Big Beautiful Bill” seeks to eliminate. 
This will mean a total loss of health coverage for 11,000 people in Wyoming. 
But that’s not all. The way it’s set up, Marketplace tax credits are basically subsidy payments to private insurance companies. 
When private companies lose a source of revenue, what do they do? 
They raise prices for the remaining customers.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming is the state’s largest insurer — covering more than 100,000 people — and the largest local vendor for coverage on the Healthcare Marketplace. They stand to lose significant business thanks to the “Big Beautiful Bill” and will react by driving up premium prices for the rest of us.
On top of the thousands of people who totally lose coverage as a result of canceling the Marketplace tax credits, roughly one in five people in the state will face a premium increase on their job-based or other private insurance.
Tax breaks are great for the people who need them. 
Right now, families in Wyoming need a break to help shoulder the cost of healthcare in our state, which is the second-highest in the nation.
Unfortunately, our elected leaders in Congress are too busy cheerleading tax cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill that will mostly benefit the richest people and corporations in America, all while driving up our national debt and increasing your health care premiums.
That doesn’t seem like much of a break to me.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers sent more than 100 bills to the governor’s desk on the final day of session on Wednesday, though less than half of the bills that had been vying for funding. 
Among the bills legislators passed in the final hours are measures to provide exclusive rights to internet gaming for Wabanaki Nations, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns and add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results. 
Two bills aimed at helping with housing affordability, one by altering the real estate transfer tax to protect mobile home parks and another to establish a property tax relief task force, are also now on the governor’s desk. Another bill passed by lawmakers on Wednesday would establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
And others would alter state government, including a change to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department and another to make it so a simple majority, rather than current two-thirds, of each chamber could extend the Legislature’s work beyond the statutory adjournment date.
These bills are not guaranteed to become law quite yet. The Maine Legislature adjourned sine die, or finally, and does not plan to reconvene until the start of the second regular session in January 2026. But Gov. Janet Mills now has 10 days to either sign or veto the bills passed on Wednesday. With the Legislature now adjourned, any bills Mills doesn’t sign will be “pocket vetoed.” 
So far this session, Mills has vetoed five bills, all of which lawmakers sustained on Wednesday.
All non-emergency laws passed this session will take effect on Sept. 24 unless the bill text notes otherwise. 
The 117 bills lawmakers passed on Wednesday followed the recommendations of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which voted those proposals off of what’s known as the appropriations table on Tuesday.
These amount to about 40% of the total number of bills — nearly 300 — placed on the table throughout the session. Legislation on the table has largely already passed both chambers on initial votes but still needed to be funded.
While some of these bills could now become law, the appropriations committee reduced or struck altogether the allocations of most given limited resources. (More details here.)
One of the proposals it amended that now awaits approval from Mills is a measure to provide more funding for reproductive health care. 
The budget addition the governor signed into law last week provided $3 million for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
The bill now on the governor’s desk, LD 143, had initially called for $6 million toward these services, but the appropriations committee advanced an amended version on Tuesday that would instead provide up to another $3 million from the available unappropriated surplus by the end of the current fiscal year. 
It was clear Republicans opposed the measure in committee, with Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) saying she was “thoroughly disgusted.” But both chambers ultimately enacted it as amended on Wednesday, with the Democratic majority and Republican Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford backing it. 
But other proposals were approved as is. That was the case for one of the most debated bills in the appropriations committee on Tuesday: LD 1937, which sought to require hospitals and their affiliates to provide financial assistance programs for medical care.
Republicans on the committee criticized it as a measure that will increase hospitals’ costs while they’re already struggling, while Democrats countered that the bill would make sure people who don’t have insurance still have access to health care. 
The state delayed Medicaid payments to hospitals this spring after Senate Republicans refused to back a change package to address the urgent deficit without structural reform to the program. Now, hospitals are also bracing to possibly take on more costs for the uninsured due to proposed cuts to Medicaid in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
But the committee left on the table the majority of the bills that had been placed there this year.  
Among those bills were two that sought to ensure the already required teachings of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively implemented across all Maine schools. 
LD 1474 sought to permanently establish a Wabanaki studies specialist in the Maine Department of Education, while LD 1202 sought to create an African American Studies Advisory Council.
Two other bills that the committee did not move off the table would have expanded the state’s infrastructure to track and test sexual assault forensic examination kits, commonly called rape kits. These preserve evidence left behind during an assault through a forensic medical examination that survivors can choose to undergo immediately after a sexual assault. DNA evidence from these kits can then be used to solve and prevent crimes.
LD 549 would have established a statewide tracking system for such kits, and LD 1816 would have conducted an inventory of existing kits in the possession of law enforcement. 
Defying the appropriations committee decision, Bennett, the sponsor of LD 549, attempted to suspend the rules to take both his bill and LD 1816 off the table on Wednesday. His motions failed. “It’s unfortunate that the appropriations of the committee hasn’t responded to the urgent needs of some people of the state of Maine,” Bennett said. 
Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Somerset) also attempted to do the same for LD 182, which would provide per diem payments for MaineCare residents of the Maine Veterans’ Homes. His motion also failed. 
Appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said Tuesday night that the committee intends to carry over bills still on the table into next year, though they were not listed among the nearly 200 bills approved for carry over in a joint order passed on Wednesday. 
Each of the legislative policy committees requested that some of the bills in their possession be carried over to next year. In addition to these, the joint order included some bills that had remained tabled in the chambers upon adjournment. 
One of those measures was LD 1822, the proposal for a comprehensive data privacy law passed by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. Meanwhile, both chambers voted down a competing data privacy measure, LD 1088. (Read more about these proposals here).

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Legislative Council on Wednesday approved the nearly two-dozen topics that lawmakers will examine in interim study committees through the end of October.
A whopping 400 topics were suggested by lawmakers and agencies but were narrowed down to 22 “through a bipartisan process” involving legislative leadership, according to Legislative Services Agency Executive Director George Angelone. The resolution was approved in a voice vote.
Selected subjects range from the value of public lands to a look at medical debt. The panels tasked with studying them can play key roles in teeing up legislation for the next session — but don’t always.
“It just allows people to gather and have more, both formal and informal, conversations about sometimes complex topics,” House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, told reporters.
House and Senate heads will assign members to each committee in the coming weeks. The two chambers trade off who chairs the groups, and it’s the Senate’s turn this year.
What made the cut
Leaders from both parties enthused over one panel tasked with studying the value of Indiana’s recreational public lands, like state parks. It must consider the direct and indirect impacts of that land on local economies, including tourism, employment, health and more.
“It’s more than just a space for families to go for camping, for recreation. It’s also a huge economic boom for our state,” said Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington.

Her counterpart, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, said quantifying the land’s value won’t lead to selling it off: “That’s not what I have in my mind.”
“We all know how valuable they are and how important they are, but the study committee will kind of flesh that out a little bit,” said Bray, R-Martinsville.
Another panel will consider medical debt: protecting debtors’ homes from liens or sales, collections or property lien limits, salary garnishment limits, monthly payment caps, and more.
Huston wrote one of the letters proposing that it be among the topics studied.
“We just have heard from a lot of different folks of what a financial burden that becomes to people, and how hard is to overcome it, and there’s very little pathway to resolve (it),” he said. “… We’ll take a look at it and see what options are available to us.”
Huston emphasized low-income Hoosiers or those who’ve needed particularly expensive procedures.
Yoder was also supportive, telling reporters, “Too many families are one medical crisis away from losing a home, losing their well-being, and we need to study that.”
Lawmakers will also review the “efficiency and effectiveness” of various state-created bodies with a focus on the work they’ve produced and how they’re funded.
It echoes an effort begun last year — although only one of the nine examined at the time had any current members show up to defend them.

“I couldn’t even begin to tell you the number of boards, commissions and study committees out there, and some of them might not be as productive as you might want them to be,” Bray said.
The panel might consider consolidating some, or getting rid of others that “haven’t been doing substantive work” recently, he added. “… It’s probably an exercise that should happen more often, is to take a look and see what’s really a productive effort and what’s not.”
Other topics include a review of child fatalities, water safety education, public school administrator salaries, long-term care insurance costs, postpartum checkups and artificial intelligence in state government, among others.
Several statutory committees and task forces — like for health care costs and Medicaid oversight — weren’t assigned any topics.
“We had a lot of legislation in those areas (over) this last session, and sometimes you’ve got to let some of those issues bake a little while, to see, before you have a new issue that you really have to grapple with,” Bray explained.
Other action
Separately, the council authorized Angelone to short five national organizations on Indiana’s membership dues.
They are the Council of State Governments, Education Commission of the States, National Conference of Insurance Legislators, National Conference of State Legislatures and National Council of Legislators from Gaming States.
“The general concept is that we would pay 5% less than the invoiced amount,” Angelone said, recalling the 5% budget cuts forced on state agencies following a grim revenue forecast.
The council took similar action in 2011, he continued, and paid the deficit amount in a later year. But the resolution approved Wednesday doesn’t have a built-in payback provision.
And, the 2011 move was negotiated to maintain Indiana’s membership, Bray said. Although this year’s “haircut” wasn’t, he expected the state to retain its place in those organizations.

(Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.











We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University



But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Jeff Landry vetoed budget language that would have provided insurance coverage for obesity medication like Wegovy to state employees. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry struck language from the Louisiana budget plan that could have provided state employees and public school teachers with insurance coverage for popular weight-loss medication over the next year. 
The governor does not think the state would be able to cover the cost for the obesity drugs on a long-term basis. 

“These drugs can cost $1,000 a month per person,” Landry wrote in his letter to state lawmakers about the veto. “Even temporary coverage could set expectations for long-term use that Louisiana simply cannot afford.” 

The provision would have affected those enrolled in state health insurance plans with the Louisiana Office of Group Benefits. The office provides coverage to 223,000 people, including state employees, public school teachers, retirees and their dependents. 

It’s not clear how many would have been given access to the weight-loss medication before the governor’s veto. 
The struck-out language called for those health plans to “incorporate semaglutide medications for the purposes of weight loss” into their pharmacy benefits, but only if it didn’t cost the state self-insured plans more money. 
The coverage was also only guaranteed for the 2025-26 budget cycle, which runs from July 1 through June 30, 2026.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Semaglutide is sold under the brand names Ozempic, Rybelus and Wegovy and has become a popular weight-loss tool in recent years. It was originally developed to treat Type II diabetes and is supposed to be taken indefinitely. Patients are expected to regain weight they lost if they stop using the medication.

Prescription prices can lower when semaglutide is initially prescribed because of rebates drug manufacturers offer. But as Landry observed, the medication is very expensive, especially if those discounts are discontinued. 
Louisiana also has a higher-than-average obesity rate of 40%, compared with just 32.8% nationally, which means more people would likely qualify for the treatment. 
“If just a small portion of eligible employees begin using them, the long-term costs could quickly climb into the tens of millions,” the governor wrote in his veto message. 
North Carolina and West Virginia initially offered to cover weight-loss drugs for their state employees but ended up cutting the benefit when the price tags for doing so skyrocketed. Connecticut and Illinois have continued to offer weight-loss drug coverage to their state employees – but at a cost of at least $40 million and $210 million, respectively. 
Even if it can’t be used for weight loss, Landry said state health care plans will continue to offer semaglutide to Type II diabetes patients.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

Let’s be clear: This isn’t just political posturing. This bill, backed by fossil fuel interests and already passed in the House, would strip away the very tools Wisconsin families, businesses, farmers and communities are using to lower energy costs, create jobs and build a more resilient future. The damage to our state would be both immediate and long-term.
In Wisconsin alone, 82 clean energy projects are currently in the pipeline. These projects represent not just thousands of jobs and billions in investment — they’re the backbone of a 21st-century economy. From wind turbine manufacturing in Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley to solar installations in rural communities, Wisconsinites are hard at work powering our future.
If the “Big, Broken Bill” becomes law, it threatens to cancel or delay many of these efforts. Clean energy tax credits would vanish. The Solar for All program and clean manufacturing investments would be eliminated. Tax incentives for electric vehicles, energy-efficient buildings, and sustainable agriculture would be repealed. These aren’t just policy tools — they’re direct investments in our people, places and potential. Many Wisconsin communities have used these credits to launch local projects that reduce taxpayer dollars through direct pay for solar, geothermal and clean vehicles.
And we can’t afford to go backward. Energy demand is skyrocketing — especially with the rapid expansion of AI and data centers. Experts warn electricity bills could jump by 70% in the next five years if we don’t act. Clean, renewable energy remains the cheapest and fastest option to deploy. Gutting these investments would lead to higher prices, more power interruptions and less energy reliability — leaving Wisconsin families and businesses to bear the cost.
Without these programs, household energy costs could rise by up to $400 a year. That’s a hidden tax hike on working families — piled on top of rising costs from tariffs and supply chain disruptions already straining our economy.
Even worse, the bill guts EPA pollution standards and allows major polluters to sidestep environmental compliance. It’s a taxpayer-funded giveaway to fossil fuel interests, trading our health, air and water for short-term corporate profits.
Let’s not forget Wisconsin’s farmers, who were just beginning to benefit from billions in IRA investments for conservation, renewable energy and carbon-smart agriculture. With grant contracts abruptly canceled, many family farms are left holding the bag, having made plans in good faith only to be blindsided.
We can do better. Wisconsin has the talent, tools and environmental leadership tradition to lead the clean energy economy. Clean energy already supports more than 71,000 jobs in our state. With the right investments, we could add 34,000 more and grow our economy by $21 billion by 2050.
We’re also home to over 350 clean energy supply chain companies. With support from IRA tax credits and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), we can expand local manufacturing of batteries, solar panels, wind components, EV systems and smart grid technology — positioning Wisconsin as a national clean energy hub.
This is the kind of forward-thinking, common-sense investment we need. It creates good jobs, lowers energy bills, strengthens supply chains and revitalizes communities.
The Senate still has time to act. Let’s urge our lawmakers, regardless of party, to reject this harmful bill and stand with the workers, innovators and families building a cleaner, stronger Wisconsin. Our policies should reflect our shared values of fairness, innovation, resilience and stewardship — not special treatment for polluters.
This isn’t about partisan politics. It’s about economic survival, energy independence and the future we want to leave our children.
It’s time to move forward, not backward, with a smarter stronger, and more sustainable Wisconsin.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)CHADRON — While recreational trail development in eastern Nebraska has hit a roadblock, progress is being made in the northwestern portion of the state to extend the nation’s longest rail-to-trail project, the Cowboy Trail.
The expansion comes as the 317-mile-long trail marks it’s 30th anniversary, when the national Rails to Trails Conservancy, which purchased the abandoned Chicago & North Western railroad line, donated it to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.
On a recent weekend, a group of bicycle enthusiasts set out from this northwest Nebraska college town to “monkey wrench” a single-track trail from Chadron eastward along a rarely used portion of remaining railroad track.
A simpler trail
The idea was to create a trail inexpensively and quickly by mowing a path in the right-of-way beside the track, rake out the rough spots, and then beat a trail into the hard soil by riding on it.


Celebrating the Cowboy Trail
Several events are planned this year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Cowboy Trail, which extends 317-miles across northern Nebraska, crossing through 30 towns.
Events culminate Sept. 5 with a celebration in Valentine that includes a bike ride, a dinner and a social hour on the railroad bridge that spans the Niobrara River east of the community.
For information about all of the events, access the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission’s website.


“We call it monkey wrenching or a guerrilla trail,” said George Ledbetter, a retired newspaper reporter, avid biker and treasurer of the Northwest Nebraska Trails Association.
The work is among efforts by several trails groups in the region that, in recent years, have extended the Cowboy Trail another 17 miles from Gordon to Rushville and obtained grants to build needed bridges along the as-yet undeveloped segment west to Chadron.
That undeveloped segment, from Rushville to where the guerrilla trail ends 5 miles east of Chadron (where Game and Parks ownership ends), is expected to be constructed and completed in 2026.
“Then we will have 40 contiguous miles from Gordon to Chadron,” said Alex Duryea, the recreation trails manager for the state Game and Parks Commission.
Ledbetter said connecting the Cowboy Trail with downtown Chadron via the “guerrilla trail” will provide a needed link for cyclers eastward through the scenic Pine Ridge and on to Hay Springs, Rushville and Gordon. It also will fill a gap in an ambitious plan to develop a cross-continental trail, the Great American Rail-Trail, which would extend across Nebraska from Omaha to Harrison.
“The Cowboy Trail is one of the gems of the whole rail-trail network of the whole nation,” he said.
Northwest Nebraska bike riders have already seen what a developed bike trail can do for visitation. In the nearby Black Hills of South Dakota, the Mickelson Trail draws an estimated 70,000 riders a year. Expansion of the Cowboy Trail would enhance tourism in the Pine Ridge area of Nebraska, a pine-studded area that includes Chadron and Fort Robinson State Park and vast tracts of national forest land.
“Obviously, out here, our big draw is outdoor recreation — hiking, biking, hunting and horseback riding,” said Kerri Rempp, tourism director of Discover Northwest Nebraska. “Giving people safe places to ride only increases our ability to attract tourists.”
Completing the Chadron-to-Rushville portion still would leave a 91-mile gap in the Cowboy Trail from Gordon eastward to Valentine. Duryea said that while there’s interest in completing that segment of trail, a local group to coordinate that effort and seek local and grant support has not yet emerged.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Expansion of the Cowboy Trail in northwestern Nebraska comes as trail enthusiasts struggle to bridge a gap in trails between Lincoln and Omaha across Cass County. The Cass County Board recently declined to affirm a 10-mile pathway for a trail to bridge a gap there, declining to OK months of work selecting a preferred route. A county board subcommittee is now at work trying to find an acceptable alternative route.
Such roadblocks aren’t unusual for trail development, and the Cass County connector trail lacks an abandoned rail line to follow, forcing up the cost and the need to find right of way that’s acceptable for nearby landowners.
“It takes time and it takes support from local trail users to develop new trails,” Rempp said. “These things are not cheap. They take a lot of time, and they take a lot of work.”
Support matters
Local “buy in,” Duryea said, is essential as well.


Less of a burr in Cowboy Trail’s saddle
“Goats heads” or puncture vine has been a plague upon the Cowboy Trail in sections since it was opened.
The spiny seeds produced by the invasive plant can puncture tires, causing delays and headaches during bike rides.
But Alex Duryea, trail boss for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, said a dent in the goats head population has been accomplished via some spraying, and, for the past two years, use of a mechanical removal device called a “sticker burr roller.”
A foam roller catches the burrs, which are collected by the slow-moving device, he said.
Duryea said that you still might get a flat tire from a goats head on the Cowboy Trail, but the removal device has reduced complaints.

The Northwest Nebraska Trails Association was founded in 2017 after being inspired by the success of trail advocates in Gordon and Rushville via the Cowboy Trails West group.
Besides its Cowboy Trail work and advocacy with state and national groups, the organization has produced maps of mountain bike and hiking trails in the Pine Ridge, Toadstool Park and around Chadron State College, and it has helped with a Volksmarch held in May at Fort Robinson.
Trail advocates, Ledbetter said, had thought the Rushville-to-Chadron portion might be completed sooner, but a grant to build that segment fell short of the project’s cost and provided only enough funds for a required environmental study and to build bridges along that portion. Then, he said, flooding that damaged the eastern portion of the Cowboy Trail in the Norfolk area delayed work on the western portion.
More recently, financial help and support from the Chadron Rotary Club, the Discover Northwest Nebraska group, the national Rails-to-Trails Conservancy and the City of Chadron have led to the planned development of the five-mile segment from downtown Chadron to where the Game and Parks part of the trail begins.
The railroad that still owns that five-mile section of track and leases it to park idle railcars, agreed to allow the trails group to utilize right of way along the track. Some informational kiosks have been installed already, and a local Eagle Scout built a bench for trailside rests.
The City of Chadron soon will take bids to build a one-mile segment from the downtown area, Ledbetter said, and the Northwest Nebraska Trails group has signed an agreement with the city to maintain and develop the remaining four miles.
Rather than wait for funding to lay down a crushed livestock trail on the remaining segment, he said local cyclists decided to mow a path and lay down a single-track trail by holding rides every Saturday morning. Volunteers have removed trees, branches and even barbed wire from the path and have used rakes and hoes to smooth the path where necessary, Ledbetter said.
The trails group is talking with local health officials about establishing trails and safe paths within Chadron and about establishing trails to connect with Chadron State Park and about extending the Cowboy Trail westward to Crawford and points west.
“Our goals are pretty huge really and we hope we can keep it going,” he said.

(Courtesy of the Bureau of Land Management)Newspapers, TV and social media have been blowing up lately, shining a light on a provision tucked in the U.S. Senate’s version of the “Big Beautiful Bill” that would force the sale of public lands. The last couple of days have been dizzying. The sell off language has been removed, only to be added back, then changed multiple times. In, out, in. Enough already. 
Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill

Selling off our public lands is wildly out of step with the values of people across our state. These are the lands where we hunt, fish, camp, hike, ride ATVs and horses, watch wildlife and find solitude. They’re our heritage — and our birthright. And that birthright is under threat.
Republicans and Democrats, ranchers and river runners, hunters and hikers — we may not agree on everything, but we all agree that public lands should stay in public hands. 
Let’s be clear about what selling public lands means: Idahoans will lose access to land that has always belonged to them. “No trespassing” signs will go up. Gates will be locked. 
This is not hypothetical. This is not alarmism. This is a real threat. And Idahoans have stepped up to confront this threat. Thousands of Idahoans have spoken out. Together we’ve called, written and visited the offices of our senators to voice our deep opposition to these land sale provisions. And it made a difference. Both U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch have now issued statements opposing the sale of public lands.

As this fight rages, those who want to steal your land have tried to dodge criticism and throw you off by repeatedly offering up different versions of language. But no “kinder, gentler” version of selling off public lands changes that selling off our public lands is still selling off public lands. It is a betrayal of all Idahoans and all Americans. It is a terrible idea and sets a terrible precedent for future sell offs of our heritage.
You see, Sen. Crapo is not just any senator. He’s the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the very committee responsible for writing this bill. In plain terms: this is Sen. Crapo’s bill. If the language forcing the sale of public lands gets removed, it will be because he made it happen. If it stays in, it’s because he allowed it to stay.
Sen.  Crapo, Idahoans are counting on you. You have the power — and the means — to stop the sale and privatization of the lands Idahoans and Americans enjoy for hunting, fishing, camping, snowmobiling, and more. Heed the calls of Idahoans and remove this terrible provision from the bill. You’ve told Idahoans you oppose selling off our public lands. Now is the time to turn that statement into action.
Sen. Risch, we need your leadership here too. As a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as someone who has championed public access in the past, your voice matters. We need you to make it crystal clear that selling public land is unacceptable and must be stripped from this bill.
Let’s not forget what’s at stake. These lands support our economy. They sustain our rural communities. They protect our water, our wildlife and our way of life.  They’re also a legacy. It’s our duty to protect them for those who will come after us. If we allow them to be sold now, they will be lost forever. And future generations will look back and wonder why we didn’t fight harder.
Idahoans believe in collaboration, in common ground, and in the power of citizens to influence policy. That’s exactly what’s happening right now. Idahoans are speaking up. They’re standing up. And they’re watching closely.
So to Sen. Crapo and Sen. Risch, we say this: thank you for listening to your constituents. Thank you for opposing this terrible idea. Now, let’s finish the job.
Strip the public land sale provision from the reconciliation bill. Keep public lands in public hands. And show the nation that when it comes to defending our shared heritage, Idaho leads.
Because once these lands are gone, they’re gone. Let’s not let that happen — not on our watch.

(Getty Images)The “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” that is making its way through Congress contains big cuts for disability services in West Virginia — a state with the nation’s highest rate of people with disabilities. 
One in three West Virginia residents live with a disability, according to federal data. The state’s system supporting thousands of people with disabilities is already over stretched due to health care deserts and a shortage of community group homes.
Republicans in Washington’s megabill calls for the elimination of all University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, including the one housed at West Virginia University, through funding cuts to the Administration for Community Living.
  Lesley Cottrell
“The impact will be immediate,” said Lesley Cottrell, director of the WVU Center for Excellence in Disabilities, which provides free services to 340,000 West Virginians living with a disability and their families through a network of programs and six clinics.
The center oversees the state’s only feeding and swallowing clinic. Cottrell said that without federal funding, the clinic won’t be able to serve patients, including children, who struggle to eat. 
The programs around the state have also helped children with communication disorders interact with the world by using augmentative and alternative communication devices, supported individuals with traumatic brain injuries and helped people with disabilities find jobs.
The budget bill lumps the nationwide developmental disability programs into diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which leading Republicans don’t want to fund amid a GOP-crack down on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
Cottrell said categorizing the CED program as DEI is an unfair description. 
“Without placing any judgment on DEI programs or initiatives … We are not, by definition, a DEI program in the sense that anyone — family or individual with those disabilities — can get our services for free. We don’t separate it by age, gender, ethnicity, race,” she explained. “Some of the foundations of DEI initiatives just aren’t present.”
The university provides a $500,000 match in funding, and the WVU CED promotes research aimed at tackling disability-related issues relevant to West Virginia.
The center employs more than 100 people through its office and contract positions. Many of those jobs would be eliminated if federal funding is eliminated through the bill, Cottrell said. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., declined to comment on the bill since negotiations continue. President Donald Trump said he wants the massive spending bill on his desk by July 4, but several major disputes — including pending cuts to Medicaid funding that would impact West Virginia — have yet to be resolved in the Senate. 
Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., and West Virginia’s Republican Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore did not return requests for comments for this story.
Several other disability-focused groups could see funding cuts because of the bill, including Disability Rights West Virginia. 
“The proposed federal budget cuts to the protection and advocacy systems like Disability Rights of West Virginia will be disastrous for the state, persons with disabilities and public safety,” said Mike Folio, DRWV’s legal director. 
The budget bill contains spending reductions for the federal departments of health and education, which would impact DRWV, according to Folio.
“DRWV received less than $2 [million] in federal funds in 2024 and stretched those dollars to monitor 176 separate facilities in West Virginia and conduct nearly 400 monitoring visits to protect our grandparents, mothers and fathers, children and family members,” he added.
DRWV serves as the state’s federally mandated protection and advocacy system for people with disabilities in West Virginia. The organization has alerted lawmakers and media to issues in state-run hospitals for people with disabilities, including patients being unnecessarily held at William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital in Weston without appropriate therapy and support services. 
The organization also discovered that a nonverbal, elderly man died in 2024 from burn injuries after being left too long in a whirlpool of scalding water at a state-run long-term care facility.
According to Folio, DRWV fills the regulatory gaps that state run offices can’t cover. 
Cottrell said the funding cuts won’t just impact people with disabilities but could also weaken funding that supports respite care for families and programs that help parents whose children are awaiting a potential autism diagnosis. 
“That’ll all be gone,” she said.

Everything Medicaid is under attack and many of the greatest health achievements in the last 15 years  are about to be rolled back.  
Medicaid is a critical lifeline to dental care for people with disabilities, kids and families with low incomes. Children enrolled in Medicaid have guaranteed, comprehensive dental benefits and Medicaid dental benefits are a significant driver of access to dental care for low-income working-age adults and seniors. Medicaid dental coverage also improves oral health outcomes for adults and children alike.
Additionally, Medicaid dental benefits are a driver of economic health for individuals and states. Adults with Medicaid dental coverage spend less out-of-pocket on dental care, helping them avoid medical debt and freeing up resources to meet their basic needs and engage in their local economy. For many adults, being able to afford dental care could be the key to getting a new job or advancing in their current one. When adults have Medicaid dental coverage, their job prospects and job performance improve. And adults with good oral health have more job opportunities. The improved oral health associated with Medicaid dental benefits could save states at least $273 million per year. Medicaid cuts will harm oral health.
According to Gina Sharps, West Virginia Oral Health Coalition executive director, numerous studies show that Medicaid adult dental coverage lowers overall health care spending on chronic disease management and emergency department usage. Emergency department visits alone cost an estimated $2.1 billion per year, and research indicates that nearly 79% of these visits could be addressed in a dental office — a potential savings of up to $1.7 billion per year. It also boosts oral health outcomes for patients and increases employment opportunities.
The high cost of dental care, particularly out-of-pocket costs, remains a major barrier to care. And for many families, Medicaid is one of the only affordable options to obtain oral health services. It is no wonder that it is also extremely popular, with over 74% of voters supporting better oral health access in Medicaid. However, adult dental services in Medicaid are considered “optional” for states and therefore at particular risk for being cut or scaled back if states lose Medicaid funding.
Current congressional proposals to cut or cap Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for billionaires would threaten the health and livelihood of tens of thousands of West Virginians. These cuts would lead to devastating dental coverage losses and ballooning medical debt, of which dental bills are already a key driver. In general, Medicaid cuts would push good oral health out of reach, causing avoidable dental problems to become emergencies and costing the health care system millions of dollars in unnecessary spending.
Reductions in federal Medicaid funding could lead states to roll back Medicaid expansion or cut program eligibility taking away health care from millions of seniors, kids and low- income adults. Additionally, the 23 million adults who rely on Medicaid for dental care would suddenly be left with nothing. In addition to reducing access to care and worsening oral health outcomes, dental coverage loses also decrease work productivity. Many adults who lose Medicaid coverage would go completely uninsured; some may be able to switch to private coverage through their state’s marketplace or their employer, but there are no requirements for private medical insurance to cover oral health.  
Additionally, major changes or cuts to the program could also put access to kids’ oral health coverage at risk even though it is mandatory. Cuts to Medicaid oral health benefits would lead to immediate and lasting harm. 
When families lose Medicaid coverage, they are more likely to go without oral health coverage than obtain expensive, private insurance. As a result, individuals forgo preventive care and early interventions, ultimately ending up in the emergency department for care at higher cost for the patient, hospital systems, states, and taxpayers.
Good oral health not only enables you to functionally perform as a human being — like speaking, smiling and eating — it is also important for communication, human relationships and financial prosperity. Poor dental health carries serious consequences that can lead to systemic and costly health conditions, such as oral health cancer and even heart disease. 
This is especially the case for those who have the biggest obstacle in getting access to dental care — rural and lower income households. 
Oral health is health and any cuts to Medicaid will have drastic consequences for both.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Tyler Lizenby)A decade ago, Kaila Adia Story and Missy Jackson were determined: Whether or not the United States government ever recognized them as a couple, they would marry. 
The two, who live in Louisville, had dated for three years by the time the United States Supreme Court took up Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark case that ultimately led to nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage on June 26, 2015. 
But before the nation’s highest court ruled 5-4 in favor of marriage equality, couples like the Story-Jacksons didn’t know where their futures stood. 
“We knew that the Supreme Court at the time was talking about same sex marriage,” Kaila said. “I just really did not have a lot of faith in the court, just from growing up in a homophobic society.” 
In May 2015, Kaila attended a conference in Florence, Italy, and Missy — the “woman out of my dreams” — went with her and proposed. 
Missy proposed before knowing they could legally marry, she said, because all that mattered was Kaila and her. She is used to “living on my own terms,” she said, and the next step was a commitment ceremony with Kaila. 
“I hit all the boxes of all the protected classes: Black, female, being a lesbian,” said Missy, 52. “Every day, we’re fighting to just exist. So I’m used to that. You either gotta be quiet, or you take up space. And then the way my mama raised me is: I belong in every room I go to.” 
For Missy, legal marriage is a “piece of paper,” and “the real commitment is to each other.” Their marriage was going to be “valid, regardless” of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Missy said.

“By the time SCOTUS announces that same sex marriage is legal, I knew that I wanted to (have a) wedding, and I knew that we were going to have a wedding and get married,” Kaila said. “Because it wasn’t legal, I thought that it was going to be just something smaller and much more intimate, but it became huge.” 
The day same-sex marriage was legalized, Kaila cried. She had never imagined that in her lifetime, she would be able to marry the woman she loved, legally, in Kentucky. 
“I couldn’t believe how things had lined up, how I didn’t feel like I was going to fall in any kind of deep love when I moved here (from Michigan), and then to be surprised and joyous by that, and then to go even farther, and to get engaged in this really romantic place, and then to come back a month later and realize that we’ll actually be able to get married and it will be legal,” she remembered. “I was blown away.” 
Kaila and Missy married April 9, 2016. 
“It was a wonderful time to finally have a legal acknowledgement that our unions are true, deep, loving — and just like everyone else’s,” Kaila said. 
‘A wonderful time,’ followed by ‘firestorm’

The Obergefell decision was immediately followed by a “firestorm” and “spotlight” on Kentucky, said Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky.
“When there is a victory, or when we do take a step forward in our civil rights and civil liberties, there’s often backlash to that,” Duke told the Lantern. “And the backlash here in Kentucky was almost immediate in terms of county clerk defiance.” 
Duke was referring to former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who made national headlines for denying same-sex marriage licenses in 2015 over her religious beliefs. Davis was briefly jailed that year.  
A decade after the Obergefell decision, political and religious conservatives still debate and challenge the landmark ruling. 
Davis has kept her legal case alive since then. The Christian law firm representing Davis, Liberty Counsel, is now moving to use her case as a way to overturn Obergefell using the same legal logic that undid Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion. 
And, at a national meeting in early June of thousands Southern Baptists, the nation’s top protestant denomination voted in favor of pushing for an overthrow of Obergefell. 
When the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas said at the time that the court should overturn Obergefell. 
Meanwhile, in 2024, the American Civil Liberties Union said it was tracking 588 bills it considers “anti LGBTQ.” 
The 2015 decision was never going to end all opposition to the LGBTQ community, Duke said, but “it felt significant. I definitely could not have envisioned in 2015 that we would be where we are today, 10 years later.” 
Kentucky doesn’t have a statewide fairness ordinance, which is “civil rights legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and to dismantle systemic racism,” according to the Fairness Campaign. At least 24 Kentucky communities have their own fairness ordinances, though. 
Conversion therapy still has a green light in the state. The discredited practice attempts to alter gender expression and sexual attraction that diverges from heterosexual normativity “with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome,” according to the The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 
Work on both of these issues, and more, “still continues,” Duke said. “Certainly within the past couple of years, the transgender community has been singled out and targeted specifically. Those attacks have been very intense.” 
Duke referenced the 2023 law passed in the Kentucky statehouse that banned certain medical care for transgender minors, such as hormone treatments. 
“I do think that there are many ways that, especially within the Kentucky General Assembly, that LGBTQ folks, particularly trans folks, have unfortunately become a political pawn,” Duke said. 
She takes issue, she said, with “culture war issues” being “prioritized as if they’re the most pressing issue in the commonwealth.” 
A ‘disheartening, disconcerting and devastating” time

The ongoing pushback against their community doesn’t affect the Story-Jacksons’ day-to-day lives, though it’s an upsetting time. 
“Both of us feel grateful to be with one another, to be married. We still celebrate and are excited about who we are,” Kaila said. “We’re in community with really, really great and supportive people who support our marriage, but … it’s really disheartening, disconcerting and then devastating right now, in certain ways, when it comes to watching the news, to seeing not only the attacks on same sex marriage, but the attacks specifically on trans communities, the attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion in work spaces.” 
In 2024, the Kentucky General Assembly banned DEI offices and programs in public colleges and universities in line with a national trend of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion. 
In his second term, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders gutting DEI programs and activities across the federal government. The Trump administration also recently withdrew grant money promised to the University of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab, citing DEI issues in the withdrawal letter.

“This fixation on wanting to return to a time in which people were brutalized, dehumanized, not seen and felt as if they needed to be hidden — I’m not sure why anyone wants to return to that kind of political and social moment,” Kaila said. “It wasn’t good then. That’s why we left that moment.” 
Missy, who works in a steel mill, is surrounded by people who are her opposites, she said, including some who’ve never met a gay person before.
Living open, she said, shows people that “we’re not that much different.” 
“We’re the same; we’re no different. I have a dog, you have a dog,” Missy said. “I belong, and I’m supposed to love who I love, and I’m happy. We have a happy life. We have a healthy life.” 
‘We’ve always fought back.’ 
Kaila is an author, an associate professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, with a joint appointment in the Department of Pan-African Studies, at the University of Louisville, and the Audre Lorde chair in Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. In these roles, she finds herself guiding young people through a tough political moment. 
Her students, she said, “are completely intolerant of the hate that they’re seeing directed at their friends and loved ones and people in their community.” 
It’s making them “almost completely apathetic to the electoral process” and “completely despondent around politics in general.” 
“I think all LGBTQ people know that in each decade, in each political moment, we have never, ever been safe as a community,” she said. “What we also recognize is that in each instance where we have always had such visceral and severe attacks on our communities — and this moment is probably the most severe — we have shown up for each other and for ourselves in each instance, fighting back and demanding for our communities to be treated in a different way.” 
The message she works to leave her students with, she said, is “we’ve always fought back” and rejected “gender and sexual tyranny.” 
“Even though this period, this moment, has been dehumanizing, disheartening and really, really depressing …. recognize that we have always responded, socially, politically, culturally,” Kaila said. “This time period should be no different.” 
Still, fighting against homophobia is “exhausting,” she said. 
“I saw this meme the other day that said, ‘if you’re tired of hearing about homophobia, imagine living through it.’ I’m tired of hearing about it; I’m tired of dealing with it,” she said. “I’m 45 years old. I’ve been gay in all these different cities and all these different places, and it’s so tiring and exhausting to keep having to defend your right to live as you are.” 
‘Black, gay and free’

It’s unclear if the challenges to Obergefell have enough legal validity to be successful, Duke said, but pointed out that the Supreme Court has proven it’s “willing to roll back rights that people have enjoyed.” 
Kaila Story-Jackson, meanwhile, said she has even less faith in the high court in 2025 than she did in 2015. 
“I don’t have much faith in SCOTUS maintaining the Obergefell decision, just like they did not maintain the Roe v Wade decision,” she said. “It’s interesting, because my faith in the court in 2015 wasn’t top tier, but right now, in 2025, it’s way below. I will be thrilled and blown away if they are able to uphold this. I think it’s absurd that folks have only been allowed to be legally married and recognized for 10 years, and there’s already this kind of backlash and pushback in response to it.” 
For now, she and Missy focus on what brings them joy: their dog, Denver, and traveling together — including a potential return to Italy next year. 
“At dinner time, we’ll talk about what’s happened today, because every day is some event, but we don’t get completely mired down. Our life is still full of community and fun and joy,” Kaila said. “I still, every day, wake up feeling Black, gay and free.”

(Courtesy of Pennsylvania Environmental Council)Anyone who doubts the economic importance of outdoor recreation in Pennsylvania should visit rural Huntingdon County, home of Raystown Lake. Thousands visit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-operated recreation area each year to boat, fish, and camp, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars spent at local businesses. 
Or rather, they used to. 
On a typical Memorial Day weekend, Raystown Lake would be packed. 
But this year, in the wake of federal staffing cuts and the resulting closure of a major campground, normally thriving operations near the lake are struggling to stay afloat. One proprietor told the Philadelphia Inquirer the campground closure has cut their business in half. Another described the scene to WJAC-TV as a “ghost town.”

Compare Raystown to any of Pennsylvania’s 124 state parks, where business is booming. Earlier this year, the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) reported a nearly 30 percent increase in state park campground reservations, and with vacation season now fully underway, tourist dollars are pouring into communities with open public lands. 
Already a $19 billion industry, Pennsylvania’s outdoor sector is only getting bigger as financially-pinched vacationers across the northeastern U.S. increasingly seek out adventures closer to home, and people are turning to the outdoors for peace and relaxation.
DCNR is working hard to maintain its spectacular resources, while also meeting growing demand, but new opportunities also await. Last month, state lawmakers got a peek at one of those opportunities on a tour of what could soon be the commonwealth’s first underground state park: the sprawling four-mile cave complex known as Laurel Caverns. 
The Cale family has stewarded the privately owned site in Fayette County for almost a century, welcoming visitors since 1964. This year, owner David Cale is ready to realize his lifelong dream of making the caverns a free, public amenity.
Acquiring Laurel Caverns won’t cost taxpayers a dime, since the Cales intend to donate the 400-acre property. All that’s required is a modest investment to update and staff the facility, which — judging from the nearly $2 billion visitor dollars spent annually in the Laurel Highlands — will soon deliver big returns in economic activity and community benefits. 
That investment is part of Governor Shapiro’s 2025-2026 budget proposal, which includes funding for trails and public lands statewide. 
Among them is the popular Glen Onoko Falls hiking trail near Jim Thorpe, which would reopen as a state park site after being closed to hikers since 2019. Like Laurel Caverns, Glen Onoko is already an established attraction with a proven record of drawing visitors who spend money locally, not to mention a spot beloved by generations of Lehigh Valley residents.

Just as important as opening new parks, the Shapiro budget also increases funding for DCNR to manage and improve our existing public lands across the state. These funds support everything from trash removal and picnic shelters to resort-class amenities enjoyed by locals and visitors alike, such as the golf course and swimming pool at Caledonia State Park.
As lawmakers hash out the budget in the coming weeks, they would do well to consider Raystown Lake, and what happens when we fail to support the outdoor assets that give back so much to our communities and the businesses that sustain them. 
The good news is that leaders in both parties understand why investing in public lands and outdoor recreation is an easy win for the economy, the environment, and all Pennsylvanians. Present and future generations of Pennsylvanians will thank Gov. Shapiro and state legislators for making our communities more livable and prosperous.

Kelly O. Hayes, the acting U.S. Attorney for Maryland, is acting no more.
Hayes was sworn in Tuesday as the next U.S. attorney for the state, replacing former U.S. Attorney Erek Barron, who left in February.
Hayes was chosen for interim post by Attorney General Pam Bondi, but someone nominated by the attorney general can only hold the post in a interim capacity for 120 days. After that, falls to the judges of the district to appoint a successor.
After the clock ran out of Hayes’ interim appointment, with no replacement nominee coming from the White House, the judges of the district voted to appoint Hayes to the job. She took the oath of office Tuesday, administered by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, and will serve until a replacement is nominated and approved.
Hayes said in a prepared statement that she was “honored by the confidence” the judges placed in her to serve.
“It is a privilege to lead this great office and to work alongside such dedicated public servants committed to upholding the rule of law and seeking justice on behalf of our communities,” her statement said. “I look forward to continuing to zealously combat criminal activity to ensure public safety and to steadfastly represent the interests of the United States.”
Hayed was raised in Montgomery County, attended the University of Maryland, College Park, and received her law degree from the University of North Carolina School of Law. After clerking for Judge Janis L. Sammartino in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, she joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland in 2013.
She served as principal deputy chief, deputy chief and, since 2021, as chief of the district court’s Southern Division. As chief, she oversaw all criminal investigations and prosecutions for the district. She also served as deputy appellate chief for the district.
Hayes has made “public safety, national security, and the protection of children …  top priorities for the District,” according to the news release.

Shingledecker comes home to Chesapeake Conservancy
In its search for new leadership, the Chesapeake Conservancy turned to an old friend, announcing Wednesday that one of its former vice presidents would be taking the helm. Susan Shingledecker, who served as the conservancy’s vice president and director of programs from 2017 to 2020, will step in as CEO on Sept. 8, according to a news release from the conservancy.

The Conservancy, which is based in Annapolis, focuses on land conservation and water restoration in Maryland.
Shingledecker will replace Joel Dunn, who left the nonprofit in December after 14 years. He went to the Campaign for Nature.
“Susan’s return is a homecoming we are thrilled to celebrate,” said Chesapeake Conservancy Board Chair Stephanie Meeks in a statement. “Following a nationwide search, the Board is confident that Susan brings the strategic leadership, nonprofit management experience and deep passion for the Chesapeake Bay that this role requires.
Shingledecker, who lives in Severna Park with her husband and two sons, comes from Earth Science Information Partners, where she served as executive director. ESIP, a Severna Park nonprofit funded by cooperative agreements with NASA, NOAA, and USGS, works to encourage scientific collaboration in the earth and climate science field.
“I’m honored to return to Chesapeake Conservancy and lead this incredible team working to protect the nation’s largest estuary and one of the most iconic and vital landscapes in the country,” Shingledecker said in the statement. “My five years at ESIP have given me an incredible understanding of the opportunities for data to inform our conservation work, increase our efficiency and grow our impact.”
Is it that time already?
The 2026 primary election is a year off — June 23, 2026 — which means it’s time for candidates to start lining up. It’s probably well before time, actually, but judging by the emails landing in our inbox in recent days, it’s never too early for some candidates. In State House races:
– Three of the four Republican incumbents in District 5, which includes parts of Carroll and Frederick counties, are running as a team for reelection. Sen. Justin Ready and Dels. April Rose and Chris Tomlinson are touting their “strong, conservative record”. Ready, the Senate minority whip, serves on Senate Finance Committee. Rose, in her second term, is the assistant minority leader and serves on the Economic Matters Committee, while Tomlinson, a freshman, is chair of the Carroll County delegation and a member of the Judiciary Committee.

Rose and Tomlinson face challenges in the GOP primary from Steve Whisler, a member of the Carroll County Board of Education who filed way back in March, and Sallie Taylor, a party activist who served as a staff member for former Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and Del. Dan Cox. She filed in April.
The fourth incumbent in District 5, Republican Del. Christopher Bouchat, told the Baltimore Sun last fall that he was disgusted with Annapolis and would not seek reelection. But not too disgusted, apparently — he told The Sun last week that he’s running for governor, although he has yet to file. He hasn’t told Maryland Matters anything because he has not returned several days worth of calls.
– Nobody claims to be running for governor in southeastern Baltimore’s District 46, so the four Democrats there getting the gang back together and running as a team. Sen. Bill Ferguson and Dels. Luke Clippinger, Mark Edelson and Robbyn Lewis tout their success bringing millions to district projects, investing in schools, pushing for affordable housing and fighting “the chaos and lawlessness of the Trump administration,” among other achievements. Ferguson, first elected in 2010, has been president of the Senate since 2020. Clippinger, also elected in 2010, is chair of the Judiciary Committee. Lewis, appointed in 2016, serves on Environment and Transportation and Edelson, a freshman, is on the Appropriations Committee. They are the only four filed in the district so far.
– In Montgomery County’s District 18, Democratic Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher did not announce a reelection team. But there were plenty of other names on his reelection announcement, which listed more than 60 endorsements already from federal, state and local lawmakers, beginning with Gov. Wes Moore (D) down to community leaders. Waldstreicher, who was elected in 2018, has been vice chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee since 2020, where he has led on various criminal justice reform measures, including the Gun Safety Act of 2023. “I’m humbled that these diverse community leaders and elected officials are supporting my re-election campaign,” Waldstreicher said in his announcement.
His District 18 mate, Del. Aaron Kaufman (D), filed paperwork for reelection last month, the only candidate actually filed in the district so far. Kaufman, elected in 2022, serves on the House Judiciary Committee. The freshman delegate, who has cerebral palsy, highlights his advocacy on disability rights such as legislation signed into law this year on powered wheelchairs.

The Republican-led state Senate passed both measures earlier this year. They now head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. The votes occurred just hours after the Senate approved a House measure dealing with the same topic.
Senate Bill 227 targets K-12 education, while Senate Bill 558 focuses on public colleges and universities. The bills would prohibit what sponsors describe as “divisive concepts” from being taught in the classroom.
These measures are part of Republican-led efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the public sector — in government, higher education and K-12 education.
Several Democratic representatives denounced the legislation targeting K-12 schools and universities as harmful in Wednesday’s House floor debate. “It is un-American to be anti-diversity, equity and inclusion,” said Rep. Amos L. Quick III, D-Guilford.
Opponents also contend the bills will chill academic freedom and honest discussions about historical oppression and that the prohibitions are vaguely worded. “What this bill does is chill teachers. They will be reluctant… to teach about the Trail of Tears, or Japanese internment camps… some of these things that are crucial to North Carolina history,” said Rep. Marcia Morey, D-Durham.
Separately, the North Carolina Senate on Wednesday passed House Bill 171, (“Equality in State Agencies/Prohibition on DEI”) which would ban state agencies from promoting, supporting, funding, implementing or maintaining workplace DEI, including in hirings, dedicated staff positions and offering or requiring DEI training. 
State workers who violate the measure could be subject to removal, a fine of up to $5,000 and potential civil litigation. And the state auditor’s office, currently held by Republican Dave Boliek, would conduct “periodic” audits of agencies to assure compliance.
Sen. Danny Britt, R-Hoke, described the bill as ensuring “everyone should be treated equally across the board.” An amendment adopted on the Senate floor added provisions that would require internal grievance processes before civil actions can be filed.
Another amendment would require that only a prevailing party could receive attorney fees. The bill had originally seemed to indicate that complainants who challenged alleged DEI activities unsuccessfully could receive them. Britt stated he believes this change “would eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the number of unfounded DEI claims.”
Sen. Val Applewhite of Cumberland County said the bill is not about protecting merit. “It’s about protecting privilege. It’s about fear, fear that as this nation grows more diverse… the grip on power by a shrinking few is slipping away.”
The bill will now go back to the House for concurrence with the Senate amendments.
To overcome a potential veto from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, House Republicans would need at least one Democrat to vote with them if all members are present.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)  The race to the legislative finish line this year was every bit as drama-filled and frenzied as expected. Restrictions on assault weapons got top billing, including on the eight-and-a-half hour marathon that marked the final day of the session, but there was plenty more to crow about and criticize during the jam-packed final weeks.
Here are five wins you might have missed from the 2025 Rhode Island General Assembly. Stay tuned for the losses, coming Friday.

 1. Shekarchi zones in on housing 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi succeeded in his push to boost housing production in Rhode Island for a third consecutive year, with 10 of the 12 bills of his legislative package clearing the Senate in the final days of the session. (All 12 had already secured approval in the lower chamber.)
That includes two bills sponsored by Shekarchi: one to expand electronic permitting and another to amend the state’s building code by centralizing the responsibilities of various officials, commissions, and boards involved in building and fire code permitting.
Other bills passed include measures to allow townhouses wherever duplexes are permitted, require mixed-use zoning in every community, and promote the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings into housing.
“Rhode Island’s housing crisis was decades in the making and is taking a sustained effort, over the course of years, to address,” Shekarchi said in a statement Monday.  “I am so appreciative of all of the partners who work with me to address our housing shortage, and this progress is the result of our collaborative efforts.”
Legislation that would have allowed development of vacant state-owned land did not make it across the finish line. Shekarchi described the bill as in need of some “fine-tuning,” pledging to work with the Senate on it again next year.  
Also left hanging by the Senate was legislation that would have eased local restrictions on subdividing large parcels of land, despite having passed in the House on May 15. However, Shekarchi noted that elements of the stalled bill were addressed in one of the successful 10 bills, which sought to eliminate unnecessary red tape and delays in local land subdivision more broadly.
Senate President Valarie Lawson said while there were concerns with the bill, she intends to continue to work with Shekarchi and other lawmakers to encourage further housing development.

2. All rise for AG Neronha 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s skilled litigation style persuaded lawmakers to his side on a host of policy changes and added funding for his office for new hires.
Neronha initially sought 13 more staffers for his office, asking for $1.7 million to fund the hires in his fiscal 2026 budget request to Gov. Dan McKee. McKee’s proposed spending plan did not offer any of the money, or additional employees.
Neronha subsequently revised his request, asking lawmakers in the House Committee on Finance for four, rather than 13, hires, funded by settlements his office had won for the states. Lawmakers included an $848,000 allocation of state settlement money for the extra AG staffers in the final fiscal 2026 budget.
Neronha thanked lawmakers for funding the hires in a statement Tuesday.
“The people of my Office show up to work every day with one goal: improve the lives of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha said. “These four additional attorneys will share in that goal, and deliver for the residents of our state.”
Neronha scored wins on several policy changes, too, including a change to state procurement to ban “bid-rigging” by public officials. The Neronha-backed legislation taking aim at McKee’s involvement in “steering” a state education contract to the ILO Group in 2021, passed unanimously in the Senate on the final night of the session, having already secured approval by a strong majority of the House. 
Lawmakers also signed on to versions of some of Neronha’s proposed remedies for the health care crisis, such as using Medicare reimbursement rates as the standard by which to hike corresponding Medicaid payments to primary care providers, and doing away with cumbersome and time-consuming pre-authorization requirements for primary care providers.
Finally, the AG’s office staved off an eleventh hour challenge by House Republicans to his authority over state settlements. GOP lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted during the House budget vote on June 17 to siphon $11 million from the AG’s fiscal 2026 funding as a quid pro quo for what they argued was an unconstitutional overstep of his authority. Neronha had already set in motion a plan to spend the $11 million state settlement from the Route 6/10 contamination lawsuit on pediatric dental care in Providence. 
Speaking to reporters after the June 17 House budget vote, Shekarchi affirmed Neronha’s authority over the state settlement funds.
“If this particular settlement was unfair, the solution is to appeal that,” Shekarchi said. “What we’re doing with the money is helping underprivileged children with health care and dental care is a good thing and I will never be against that.”
Neronha’s office did not return inquiries for comment Tuesday.

3. Republicans at the ready for 2026 
The most high-profile victory of the session belongs to those who supported a state ban on assault-style weapons — even if the final legislation did not go as far as some had hoped. 
But state Republicans wasted little time turning “L” on what they say is a matter of Constitutional rights into a potential win for the party and its candidates in the 2026 election cycle.
GOP Chairman Joe Powers initiated the call to action Friday night, declaring it was actively recruiting candidates to challenge the “anti-Constitution, anti-liberty legislators” who voted to limit assault-style weapons in the state.
“We now have a clear, targeted list of every legislator who voted to betray their oath — and their time is running out,” Powers said in a statement. “To every Rhode Islander who still believes in the Constitution — we’re not going to fix this by posting memes or yelling at the TV. We fix it by running for office, knocking doors, and taking back this state seat by seat.”
His call to action has already been met with a flurry of responses — a few dozen potential candidates have reached out to the Republican Party in just the last four days, Powers said Tuesday night.
Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz of North Smithfield debuted a new “Keeping the Spirit of 1776 Alive” fundraising campaign Tuesday morning, seeking support and donations to retain and boost the Republican’s 14-person presence on Smith Hill.
It’s no secret that state and local Republican party committees have struggled to recruit candidates for state and local office, diminishing their voice in a solidly blue state. Could the contested ban on assault weapons sales change the tides in their favor?
“I think it can’t hurt,” said Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican and former House minority leader.
Newberry had already heard rumblings of potential Republican challengers coming out of the woodwork to run against Sen. John Burke, a West Warwick Democrat who voted for the revised assault weapons ban in committee, and again on the floor, last week. Burke in a text Tuesday declined to comment, noting the 2026 legislative elections are still more than a year away.
Powers also declined to reveal details of party strategy, but said the GOP is eyeing specific legislative districts to mount challenges next year, with plans in the works well before the legislature’s final vote on the assault weapons sale ban.
“We saw the writing on the wall,” Powers said in an interview. “We’re not dummies.”

4. Hands off those cat claws  
Your furniture may hate you, but your cat will soon thank you. Lawmakers in the final days of session approved companion bills that ban declawing felines unless it’s for therapeutic use, such as to treat recurring infections or an abnormal condition in the claw that comprises the feline’s health. Anyone who violates the ban faces a fine up to $1,000. 
State law already prohibits landlords from requiring their tenants’ cats to be declawed, carrying a similar fine to the legislation banning the practice statewide.
“Declawing is painful, unnecessary and inhumane — it’s no way to treat any pet,” Sen. Melissa Murray, the Woonsocket Democrat who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. “Fortunately, there has been growing awareness of the risks and cruelty of declawing.”
Declawing a cat is viewed as similar to severing a human finger at the last knuckle, according to written testimony by the Animal League Defense Legislative Fund. The organization stated that scratching is a normal, healthy behavior for felines as it allows them to stretch their back muscles, relieve stress, and keep their nails in good condition.
The proposed ban also saw support from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Paw Project, and Humane World for Animals. 
But not all advocacy groups supported the legislation. The Rhode Island Veterinary Medical Association submitted a letter saying the decision to declaw should be left up to vets, not the state.
New York was the first state to ban declawing cats in 2019, followed by Maryland in 2022 and Virginia in March 2024. Massachusetts legalized a similar ban earlier in the year.
  A bill weakening public notice requirements for sale of self-storage units passed the Rhode Island General Assembly on the final night of the legislative session. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
5. Self storage sale protections that could have been 
It might seem odd to celebrate failed legislation. But Rep. Cherie Cruz refused to let the outcome diminish her joy over a rare demonstration of bipartisan support for protections for self-storage unit renters in the lower chamber Friday.
The proposal aims to weaken public notice requirements that self-storage facility owners have to give before selling off contents of “abandoned units.”
Cruz successfully petitioned her legislative colleagues to support a floor amendment to the House version that gives storage unit renters 15 days, rather than one, to access their unit after defaulting on a payment, and extends the amount of time storage unit owners have to advertise pending sales online.
“This bill wasn’t my top priority, but it was something I saw as a basic right to notice,” Cruz said in an interview Tuesday. She noted that the housing crisis has forced people to move into smaller spaces, potentially doubling or tripling up with family or friends and putting their belongings in self storage. 
Cruz’ amendment scraped through in a 32-31 vote, with support from progressive and moderate Democrats and nine of 10 chamber Republicans. Adding to the drama of the narrowest vote margin of the night: Rep. Brandon Voas, a Cumberland Democrat, missed the vote on the amendment, but later asked to have his vote recorded as a ‘“no.”
His request was shot down because it would have changed the outcome — against the chamber’s rules. 
Cruz called it “democracy in action,” noting the rarity for floor amendments on any issue to pass without leadership’s backing.
“It gave me hope,” she said.
But her triumph was fleeting; minutes later, the chamber approved the unchanged, Senate version of the bill, which sets a one-day window for renters to access their units after defaulting on payments, and only requires online notice of a sale once a week for two consecutive weeks.
Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat and bill sponsor, did not vote for Cruz’ amendment, though Cruz said Hull told her he thought it “made sense.” Hull did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment.
Robert Jacquard, a lobbyist paid $3,500 a month to represent the Self Storage Association, said in an email Tuesday that he would work with Cruz on her ideas for additional notice requirements during the “offseason.”

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)This week Virginia has set new heat records and come close to beating old ones for this time of year. The Richmond airport recorded a temperature of 99 degrees at the hottest part of the day on Tuesday, Roanoke reached 99, and Alexandria reached 98. Those high temperatures come at a crucial time for many crops growing across the commonwealth.
“We are at a critical point for certain crops like corn that are either about to pollinate or our pollinating and so it will have an impact,” said Wilmer Stoneman, vice president of agriculture development and innovation for the Virginia Farm Bureau.
Virginia’s largest commodities include corn, soybeans, cotton, peanuts and wheat. In the summer, crops are pollinating but high heat reduces the pollen survival rate, which could impact yields down the road. 
“When it comes to corn there’s research that’s been done that says for every day you’re above 90 degrees consecutively you can have a 3-5% reduction in yield during bloom period,” said Matthew Chappell, director of Virginia Tech’s Tidewater Agricultural Research and Extension Center.
While some may have lamented the amount of rain Virginia experienced this spring, those soggy days and others to come are helping save crops as the temperature rises. The state’s soil is very moist which helps keep crops alive, even though rainy days may make it difficult for farmers to get tractors through their fields. The National Weather Service in Wakefield predicts showers will fall across most regions of the state this weekend and some days next week. 
“This is the time of year we need a little temperature but we have to have rain,” Stoneman said.
If things were to take a turn towards drier patterns while high temperatures persist, then farmers would have cause to worry. As of Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that no counties in Virginia are under drought conditions. This year the state has seen an average of three inches more rain than normal.
“This time last year it turned hot, but it also turned dry. We had what a lot of people consider a mini drought and it basically went from a bumper corn crop the year before to basically no corn crop,” Stoneman said. “Producers had half over or didn’t produce any corn last year.”
Chappell said that this year is not necessarily hotter than past years; rather the extreme heat is happening earlier than usual during a delicate time in the growing process for multiple crops. The heat also puts restraints on when laborers can be in the fields tending to crops, as heat indexes can reach extremely dangerous levels.
“Extremes and prolonged weather extremes are always a tough hurdle for farmers to to deal with, but they’re resilient folks,” Stoneman said, adding that the rain is welcome and necessary. “We can’t have all sunshine and make a crop.”
Stoneman also said the wet soil is contributing to a humid weather pattern that can help form thunderstorms that will provide more rain. But that precipitation needs to be widespread across the growing fields to have a big impact on crops.

This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Tennessee Lookout . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. 
ProPublica and the Tennessee Lookout are continuing to investigate Harpeth Financial, which owns Flex Loan operator Advance Financial and online sportsbook Action 247. To tell us about the experience you had with either or both companies, call or text reporter Adam Friedman at 615-249-8509.
Jeanette Thomas had just made her first payment on a loan from payday lender Advance Financial when she said the company emailed her with “good news.” She could borrow $206 more. 
The solicitation was a relief to Thomas, a 62-year-old grandmother who had already exhausted the $783 disability check she receives each month since her health conditions render her unable to work. 
Over the next few months, Thomas made the required minimum payments on what started in 2019 as a $400 loan to buy Christmas presents. But each time she did so, the company invited her to borrow almost all of the payment back, she said, with emails or letters like “Access Your Cash Today” or “You’re Already Approved.”
“They kept trying to rope me in,” Thomas said.
In the months that followed, the company continued to expand her credit, allowing Thomas to borrow close to $1,600 in total. In the emails and letters that Thomas kept, Advance never stated how much it would cost if she continued to reborrow. 
Thomas had read her original loan documents warning that the loan carried a high 279.5% interest rate and would be challenging to pay off. But as the loan balance grew, Thomas came to realize she was trapped. By the spring of 2021, Thomas had paid Advance almost $4,000, yet she still owed more than $1,000 and was paying more than $200 a month to cover the interest, depleting the disability checks that were her only source of income.
Until the Flex Loan, reborrowing or rolling over payday loans was against the law. Tennessee lawmakers first banned reborrowing when they passed the state’s payday lending law in 1997. They reaffirmed that protection in 2011 when they updated that law.
When Tennessee lawmakers passed a 2014 law allowing Flex Loans, they included no such provision.
Instead, the bill’s sponsor, current House Speaker Cameron Sexton, said the loans could be better for borrowers because it required them to make a monthly minimum payment that covered all fees, interest and 3% of the principal. This key provision would ensure that borrowers would always be paying down the principal on the loan.
Thomas and more than a dozen borrowers told the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica that Advance has encouraged them through emails and notifications to borrow back the value of almost all of the payments they made, tearing a hole in the safety net the law tried to put in place. 
All but one of the 14 borrowers who spoke to the newsrooms for this story reported having reborrowed at least once as part of their Advance loan. As with Thomas, Advance made them eligible to borrow more shortly after paying, even though they were often making the minimum payments and almost immediately borrowing the money back to cover the cost of the payment they just made.  Advance went on to sue 12 of these borrowers once they stopped being able to afford the loan.
  Advance Financial sent ads to several borrowers telling them they were eligible to borrow more. (Obtained by Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. Highlighted and redacted by ProPublica.)
Andrea Heady, 45, was sued by Advance in Knoxville for over $7,300, despite having paid the company nearly double what she ultimately borrowed. She initially took out $750 through a Flex Loan after the hours at her university job were slashed in June 2020.
“I’ve always sent money home to my mom,” who was taking care of Heady’s sister, she said. “It was COVID. My aunt and uncle were very sick, then they passed away and I just needed money.”
Heady said Advance would send her notifications letting her know she could borrow more. One email appeared as a financial statement, but included in bold and large text was the amount she had available to borrow. The statement did not provide a payment schedule, a new loan amount, the total cost of the loan or how long it would take to pay off making minimum payments, information a lender would have been required to provide if she’d been borrowing on a credit card.

Heady reborrowed on her Flex Loan over a dozen times over the next 18 months as Advance increased her credit limit seven times. She stopped paying when her monthly payments of $650 equaled a quarter of her paycheck. 
Heady hoped the company would forget about her, but it didn’t. In 2024 Advance sued and won a wage garnishment against her. Ultimately, Heady will end up paying Advance over $14,000 on the $3,850 she borrowed. 
David Hill, a 36-year-old from Nashville, started by borrowing $175 from Advance in February 2020. Each month he would repay the full borrowed amount, including interest and fees, and reborrow the principal, often on the same or next day. Over 18 months, he reborrowed almost 80 times.
“COVID happened and I was going through financial trouble,” Hill said. “I would get a check and pay it off. But then I would have to borrow it back to have money.”
Via email, Advance kept increasing his credit limit and encouraging him to borrow more. “Dear David,” started two of the emails, which contained notes like “good news — you have $645 available.” Hill eventually reached a point where he couldn’t afford the minimum payment, totaling over $400 a month. 
He stopped paying and the company sued him in 2023 for over $4,700.

The Lookout and ProPublica sent detailed questions to Cullen Earnest, the senior vice president of public policy at Advance Financial. Earnest repeated what he said in a previous statement, that the company has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. He added that the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions has received just 91 complaints about flexible credit lenders since 2020, representing less than 0.001% of all new flex loan agreements, and that this data reflects the satisfaction of the vast majority of Advance’s customers.
The Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica previously reported that the company has sued over 110,000 Tennesseeans since it began offering the Flex Loan in 2015, making it one of the largest single plaintiffs in the state. One of the subjects in that story reborrowed on her Flex Loan over a dozen times, turning $4,400 in borrowed cash into more than $12,500 in payments to Advance. The company sued her and won a judgment that led to the garnishment of her wages. 
Christopher Peterson, a senior official with the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2012 to 2016 and a contributor to multiple reports about payday loans, said the agency sought to limit reborrowing on payday and title loans because the desire to borrow again often indicated that borrowers couldn’t afford the loans and would be paying them off forever. That is especially true of the Flex Loan in Tennessee, he said. 
“It’s a nasty loan,” he said.
 A better loan?
The CFPB began targeting high-interest lenders in 2013, releasing a report on the dangers of payday loans and how reborrowing often led to debt traps. 
With the threat of federal regulation looming, Advance Financial Chairman Michael Hodges started working with Tennessee lawmakers to create a new type of high-interest loan that would avoid federal oversight, he told the Nashville Business Journal. 
In Tennessee’s state House, Advance and other high-interest lenders turned to Sexton to sponsor the legislation.
Sexton was then the majority whip, a position typically reserved for ambitious state House members hoping to travel up the party’s ranks. Sexton also knew banking. He worked at a local bank as a business development executive, a position he still holds today, along with having a seat on its board.

Starting in the spring of 2014, Sexton began guiding Flex Loan legislation through Tennessee’s state House committees. On the surface, the bill appeared to be a new type of loan with a 24% interest rate, which would be significantly cheaper than the triple-digit interest on payday and title loans. But the actual cost could be found in the bill’s details, which gave lenders the right to charge a 0.7% daily customary fee, which over a year adds another 255.5%.
Official video recordings from legislative committee hearings show that neither legislators nor Sexton discussed reborrowing or the loan’s interest rate. 
When Sexton took to the Tennessee House floor in April 2014, his colleagues showed him deference because of his banking experience, said former Rep. Craig Fitzhugh, a rural West Tennessee Democrat and the minority leader at the time, who sponsored the original payday lending legislation in 1997.
During the hearing, Fitzhugh asked Sexton if he thought the soon-to-be-created Flex Loan was “a step up for consumers” compared to payday and title loans. Sexton said that was a “fair statement.”
When a lawmaker asked about the interest rate, Sexton said it was 190% to 210%, which is lower than the actual rate. But Sexton once again assured lawmakers that the minimum payment would reduce the cost of the loan for consumers. 
“When you reduce the principal each and every month, obviously you’re decreasing the amount of interest,” Sexton said from the House floor.
The Flex Loan legislation passed the Tennessee House 83-6, with Fitzhugh abstaining from the vote. Fitzhugh said the high-interest lending landscape in Tennessee has only “gotten worse” over the past decade because of Flex Loans. 
Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat, said she regrets voting for the Flex Loan legislation and feels like proponents of the legislation misled her.
“I definitely would not vote that way today, and would like to work to fix that massive mistake that’s hurt so many Tennesseans,” Johnson said. 
A spokesperson for Sexton did not respond to questions from Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica.  
Since passing the Flex Loans bill in 2014, Sexton has received over $105,000 in contributions to his campaign and political action committee from Advance Financial and its affiliated PACs, making them one of his largest contributors. 
No money for food
Over five years after the law passed, Jeanette Thomas walked into an Advance Financial store three weeks before Christmas 2019 and filled out an application.
Thomas said she listed her income, gave them her debit card number and permission to directly charge her bank account the required monthly minimum payment. A borrower isn’t required to put up any assets, like a car or future paycheck, to get a Flex Loan. 
  Thomas wound up in a debt trap, borrowing again and again to keep herself afloat. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had tried to restrict reborrowing to protect consumers from falling into this kind of hole. (Stacy Kranitz for ProPublica)
Unlike some other borrowers, Advance allowed Thomas to pay monthly, instead of biweekly, because that’s how she received her federal disability benefits. Thomas said she suffered physical abuse for decades that left her with a traumatic brain injury.
The company deposited $400 into her account the same day she walked into the store. 
At the time of the loan, Thomas had been trying to build a better relationship with her two sons and three grandchildren. She used the money to purchase gift cards, art supplies and toys. She was happy to be able to give her family something for the holidays. 
Thomas’ first minimum payment to Advance was due Dec. 31 and was a manageable $51.78. That December had been cold, and when Thomas’ heat bill came in $50 higher than normal, she started to worry. 
Then, just two days after her loan payment, Thomas said an unsolicited email arrived from Advance telling her she was eligible to borrow $206 more. Thomas thought she could afford it. Why would Advance loan her money she couldn’t pay back, she said she thought. 
What Thomas did not realize was her first bill had only been for a 13-day payment period, meaning she’d been charged less than two weeks of interest. By taking the additional loan for an entire month, her monthly payment would almost triple to $130 per month. 
Over the next two months, the company offered her a lifeline, extending her credit limit enough that she could make her payments with the money she’d just borrowed. 
Eventually, Advance stopped increasing her credit limit and her monthly payment had increased to $230 a month, almost a third of her disability check.
Thomas cut her spending to the bone, hoping that a few months of payments would get her out of debt. She turned to friends to help pay for food, and to a local church to cover her utility bill. 
Thomas said Advance sent her mailers and emails multiple times a month, offering to let her borrow any of the principal she had paid off. She tried to resist, but inevitably, she would have an unexpected expense, like medical bills from a series of mini strokes. 
Thomas found herself in the position the CFPB had warned about when it sought to restrict reborrowing. Former CFPB official Peterson, who’s now a law professor at the University of Utah, helped work on the agency’s 2017 payday regulations. At the time, the agency wrote that consumers who reborrowed would inevitably be forced to choose between making an unaffordable payment on the loan or paying for necessities like food or rent.
By May 2021, Thomas could no longer afford to pay. The company kept her loan open and unpaid for 90 days, allowing the interest and fees to accumulate, nearly doubling the amount due to $1,700. Advance then charged Thomas two times in one week, withdrawing $430, or half of her monthly budget.
  Thomas continues to receive bills requesting a minimum payment of $226.49 years after closing her account with Advance Financial. (Obtained by Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.)
“I can remember just lying in my bed, stomach hurting and doubled over in pain because I couldn’t get something to eat,” Thomas said. 
Not knowing where to turn for help, Thomas filed a complaint with the Tennessee attorney general’s Division of Consumer Affairs. In her complaint, she wrote that Advance “needs to stop abusing their power.” 
“Now I cannot pay my rent,” she said. 
The state investigated the case and took no action. By October 2022, Advance noted on one of Thomas’s monthly bills that it had “written off” her loan and closed her account. Unlike the other 110,000 Tennesseans who fell behind in their payments, Advance hasn’t sued Thomas, whose federal benefits are protected from garnishment. 
The company also agreed in a letter to the state to “cease all communications” with Thomas, but Advance continues to send bills requesting a minimum payment of $226.49.

“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
Living longer
People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
Uncertain grants
Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
Skipping pills
In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

It’s not that often that floor debates in the North Carolina legislature shed much light on important subjects.
One impressive exception to this rule took place this week, however, when Durham Democratic Senator Sophia Chitlik addressed a bill that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state government.
In her remarks, Chitlik pointed out a glaring problem that has afflicted numerous bills advanced by Republican lawmakers this year – bills that that they, the sponsors, claim are designed to end all discrimination and promote quote “equal opportunity.” Namely, they were all drafted and sponsored exclusively by white men.
As Chitlik’s remarks served to highlight, the Senate features several members from groups long targeted for blatant discrimination in our society – women, people off color, LGBTQ people – and it only stands to reason that any bill worth its salt on the subject would include at least some involvement from them. But of course, they don’t.
The bottom line: The anti-DEI bills aren’t about ending discrimination — they’re about protecting it. Arguments to the contrary are simply delusional.

The PCS (Proposed Committee Substitute) to House Bill 59 would expand eligibility requirements for existing county programs that give property tax breaks to citizens 65 and older and to those with permanent disabilities. The programs are administered by all of North Carolina’s 100 counties, but state lawmakers must sign off on any changes.
  Rep. Erin Paré (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rising property taxes, particularly in the state’s urban centers, are making it increasingly difficult for seniors and citizens with disabilities to stay in their homes, State Rep. Erin Paré (R-Wake), a bill sponsor, told committee members.
“I’ve heard from people who are in their 80s who bought their homes 50 years ago and they just simply cannot, based on their fixed income as a senior citizen, afford to live there anymore because they can’t afford their property tax bill,” Paré said. “It’s very sad because at that age, they want to stay in their home, of course, and they don’t want to move, and this is a desperate situation for them.”
The committee gave a favorable report to the PCS and referred it to the House Finance Committee. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 349, a bill that Paré said does “almost the exact same thing” is winding its way through the Senate. With the General Assembly set depart Raleigh for an extended summer break this week, final approval — if it occurs — will almost certainly not occur until later in the summer or fall.
The current relief menu
North Carolina currently offers three property tax relief programs for qualified homeowners that are administered by counties:

The Elderly/Disabled Homestead Exemption is for residents 65 years or older or those who are totally and permanently disabled. The program excludes from taxes the greater of $25,000 or 50% of the assessed value of the owner’s permanent residence.
The Circuit Breaker limits the amount of annual property taxes the owner pays on their permanent residence. Eligibility is limited to homeowners who are 65 and older or who are totally and permanently disabled. The tax bill is limited to a fixed percentage of income, and any taxes owed above that limit is deferred until a “disqualifying event” such as the owner’s death. This program requires a new application to be filed every year.
The Disabled Veteran Exclusion program excludes up to the first $45,000 of the appraised value of the permanent residence of a disabled veteran who has a total and permanent service-connected disability or who received benefits for specially adapted housing. There is no age or income limitation for this program.

 Increasing eligibility
Under HB 59, a provision would be added to the program for elderly citizens and those with disabilities who are married. Currently, income cannot exceed $37,900 for a married couple. It would increase by 15% to $43,585 for a couple under HB 59.
Also, a new income eligibility provision would be added to the Circuit Breaker program. A household of two earning up to 70% of area median income (AMI) would qualify. Currently, the income limit is $56,850. Paré noted that the income limit for Wake County would jump to $68,495 for the Circuit Breaker program under HB 59.
“By connecting this to average median income, we’re trying to apply it uniformly, but it really addresses more of those high cost of living areas where there’s move of a problem,” Paré said.
For some counties, Paré said, existing program qualifications and income eligibility requirements will be better than those proposed under HB 59.
Counties would absorb tax revenue losses if HB 59 becomes law, Paré said when asked by Rep. James Roberson (D-Wake) if Wake County leaders were prepared for such a scenario. Paré estimates tax revenue losses of $15 million for Wake County if the bill becomes law.
“What I can tell you Rep. Roberson, there’s nothing in the bill that makes a county whole as a result of this by the state, if that is what you’re asking me,” Paré said.
Paré added that she worked with the Wake County Tax Administrator Marcus Kinrade and others on the bill.
“He’s [Kinrade] obviously the tax administrator and not an elected county commissioner, but I would say that in my discussions with county commissioners, that they have been looking for this, wanting to support something like this,” Paré said.
  Rep. Donny Lambeth (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) said he welcomes legislation to ease tax burdens for senior citizens and other populations vulnerable to rising property taxes.
“I hear this a lot from senior citizens in my district because property taxes, in fact, have gone up so much over the last 10 years for houses and house values have gone up, so it it’s become a big issue, particularly in my county,” Lambeth said. “I think you have come up with a reasonable solution. Will there be some impact to the counties? Yes, but I don’t think that there will be a major impact to the counties, so I wholeheartedly support doing something to try to help these individuals.”
 Residents and advocates weigh in
John Adcock, a Wake County resident, spoke in favor of the bill, noting that Wake County has raised property taxes four consecutive years. Adcock said his tax bill has increased 43% since 2020. And while he would not qualify for the tax help under HB 59, Adcock said his mother would if she were still alive and the bill became law.
“If she had lived to this year, her property taxes on her residence would have increased by 85% over the last five years for life,” Adcock said. “It’s my belief that my mother would have qualified for this exclusion, and by operation of this bill, her tax bill would be cut in half for 2026.”
He said property tax hikes, increases in insurance premiums and local government sales taxes all contribute to the “financial burden of homeownership.”
“From a Wake County residence perspective, the way county commissioners have talked about housing affordability, yet their tax policies say the exact opposite” Adcock said. “By the adoption of this bill, the General Assembly will have a direct and tangible impact on housing affordability for those that qualify for this exemption.”
  Mary Bethel (Photo: NC Coalition on Aging)
Mary Bethel, chairwoman of the North Carolina Coalition on Aging, said transportation was the biggest issue people faced 40 years ago when she began advocating for seniors. The big issue now, she said, is concern about property taxes.
“We constantly hear from people, particularly those as Rep. Paré said have been in their homes for decades, who basically cannot afford their property taxes,” Bethel said. “This is happening not only in large metropolitan areas like Wake County where you’ve got a lot of big homes that are expensive, going up in neighborhoods that have lower income homes, but it’s also happening in smaller counties too where the property tax base is their primary source of revenue, so it’s a big issue.”
Bethel said a provision that would remove the tax deferment from the Circuit Breaker program would likely encourage more people to use the program. She said the program isn’t utilized as much as others because homeowners don’t want heirs to inherit their debt.
“It’s going to take a lot of education of older adults and persons with disabilities to assure them their property is not going to have a lean placed on it,” Bethel said. “I think this is a step in the right direction.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Property-taxes-iStock-Getty.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 05:01:56.870275

[…]","Getty Images.A Franklin County judge said Ohio’s private school voucher program is unconstitutional in a ruling this week. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s office is planning an appeal of the decision.
The court granted a summary judgment, which is a ruling that comes from a judge without the need for a full trial in the case.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page said the General Assembly has “exceedingly broad powers to tax, organize, administer and control the common school system,” but those powers “do not include unlimited discretion.”
The judge pushed back on private school voucher supporters’ claims that the program is a subsidy program providing scholarships, rather than a separate system of schools.
The idea of the “EdChoice” vouchers as a scholarship program instead of a system of schools “is mere semantics,” Page wrote, due to the fact that the state pays schools directly, rather than parents.
“More importantly, private schools participating in EdChoice receive substantially more state funding per student than public schools,” Page wrote. “Where EdChoice participating private schools are inexplicably receiving double the per-pupil state funding than public schools, it is difficult to say that EdChoice is simply a scholarship that follows and/or benefits the students as opposed to a system that benefits private schools.”
The state spent nearly $1 billion on private school vouchers in 2024 alone as near-universal eligibility was approved by the Ohio General Assembly.
The ruling rejected one of the claims from voucher opponents, an accusation that the voucher program created segregation in public schools as white students leave to attend private schools. The judge said no evidence of “discriminatory intent” was shown.
Though the judge ruled the voucher program unconstitutional, she allowed the program to continue “in recognition that this decision may cause significant changes to school funding in Ohio and the high likelihood that the parties will immediately appeal.”
Public school advocates praised the decision as not just a good one, but the constitutionally correct one.
“Any ruling different than the one we got would have been a horrific surprise and a mistake according to the constitution,” said William Phillis, executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, one of the leaders of the lawsuit.
A spokesperson for Senate President Rob McColley said the suit was “a shameful case of bench-shopping from a radical organization that prefers to vilify parents and children who simply want a better educational environment than they have now.”
A history lesson
The lawsuit was a constitutional challenge to Ohio’s private school voucher program. It started in January 2022, when opponents of the program filed their case in Franklin County, alleging violations of two clauses of the Ohio Constitution.
The first was a claim that the voucher program violated the requirement in the constitution that the state support a “thorough and efficient” system of public education, and the second claim alleged a violation of the state’s equal protection clause.
The case included an attempt to question Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman back when he was the Senate’s president, about legislative measures to support the voucher program and the process of implementing the program statewide. Huffman fought a subpoena and argued he had nothing to share in a deposition, adding that legislative privilege protected him from such questioning.
The court allowed Huffman to avoid an in-person deposition, instead requiring him to submit to written questioning, a decision he appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court.
Many Ohio school districts signed on to the lawsuit, including districts in Columbus, Cleveland Heights-University Heights, Richmond Heights, Huffman’s hometown of Lima, and Barberton. Individuals and parents of students also joined as parties to the lawsuit.
The schools and voucher opponents argued the funding that was being given as part of the program was taking away funding from public schools, who serve the vast majority of students in Ohio.
Page noted in her decision that in fiscal year 2022, more than $300 million went to about 575 chartered non-public schools through the voucher program, and of the schools that received the funds, 154 were given voucher funds for 75% or more of their enrolled students.
The judge also brought up arguments from certain schools who joined the lawsuit, who said “inadequate funding” has caused lay offs or suspensions of teachers and staff, causing overcrowded classrooms and insufficient support.
Page said the amount of records in the case “is unquestionably voluminous,” with reference materials “from before Ohio’s statehood up to the General Assembly’s modification of EdChoice in (Ohio House Bill) 33,” the previous state budget bill.
The 47-page court decision included its own history of school funding legislation and legal battles, which included education debates at “the forefront of Ohio’s leaders’ decision-making during the (state) Constitutional Convention of 1850.”
Ultimately, out of that convention came the current language of the constitution, requiring the General Assembly to “secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state; but no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state.”
Several state constitutional conventions attempted to change this wording, even proposing leaving out the “religious or other sect” language.
Delegates at an 1873 convention said removing the language on religious sects would “leave the Constitution so crippled that the various religious denominations may divide the common school fund among them, for the support of sectarian schools.”
“The moment we consent to do so, we deal the death blow to the system of common schools, upon which expanded and improved by increasing experience and wisdom, more than upon anything else … depends the perpetuity and efficiency of our American institutions and government,” another delegate said in 1873.
‘School choice’
Private school voucher supporters, including Ohio’s legislative leaders and Gov. Mike DeWine, have argued Ohioans should be free to choose the school they want to send their students to, instead of being tied down to “underperforming” public schools in the area in which they live. The mantra of “school choice” is one that has sounded from Republican state leaders and federal GOP leaders alike.
In Tuesday’s ruling, Page said the non-public schools who receive private school vouchers are largely religious, and are able to deny enrollment to students based on their own standards.
These schools aren’t subject to anti-discrimination laws, Page wrote, therefore they can turn students away based on religion, sexual orientation or disability.
“By bestowing participating private religious schools with complete control over prospective students’ participation, the ‘school choice’ here is made by the private school, not ‘as the result of independent decisions of parents and students,’” Page wrote, citing previous case law.
The Catholic Conference of Ohio released a statement expressing their disappointment in the ruling, but also emphasizing their confidence that the private voucher program “will prevail” on appeal.
“The Catholic Church will continue to advocate for and defend programs that support parents as the primary educators of their children and enable them to select a school that best suits their child’s needs,” the statement from conference Executive Director Brian Hickey said.
The heads of Ohio’s education unions said the ruling was just a confirmation of what public schools have known already, “that Ohio’s unsustainable and costly private school vouchers are draining public funds and preventing legislators from fully funding the quality public school education that every child … is entitled to under the Ohio Constitution,” as Ohio Federation of Teachers leader Melissa Cropper put it.
Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro said though he expects this ruling to be the first step in a longer process through appeals, the ruling “represents a huge victory for Ohio’s public school educators, school communities and students.”
“The work does not stop here,” DiMauro said in a statement. “But I am confident this initial ruling will ultimately stand up through the appeals process, and Ohio can once again dedicate its resources fully to funding our public schools and ensuring all Ohio students can get the world-class education they deserve – no exceptions.”
A request for comment from House Speaker Matt Huffman was unreturned as of Wednesday afternoon.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Zohran Mamdani’s upset in NYC mayoral primary resonates in CT,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/zohran-mamdanis-nyc-mayor-cuomo-lamont/,CT Democrats called Mamdani’s win significant but warned against proclaiming him the answer to what went wrong in the 2024 presidential race.,"Inevitably, Gov. Ned Lamont was asked Wednesday about the stunning victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary by a 33-year-old socialist, Zohran Mamdani, over the 67-year-old former governor, Andrew Cuomo, whom Lamont had recently, if awkwardly, identified as his favorite. 
“Mamdani ran a hell of a race, didn’t he?” Lamont said, as a Democratic Party in the throes of an identity crisis rushed to find larger meaning in the upset. “He surprised the hell out of the establishment world down there. And I salute him for the job he was able to get done.”
Elected Democrats in Connecticut, Lamont included, called Mamdani’s victory significant for his youth and message, while most also cautioned against instantly proclaiming him as the answer to what went wrong in the 2024 presidential race.
The premise of generational change embodied by a candidate promising things largely anathema to Lamont — higher taxes on the rich, free buses, universal child care, a freeze on rents of rent-controlled apartments — comes during a particularly difficult week for a 71-year-old Connecticut governor whose brand is fiscal discipline and stability.
Lamont vetoed two bills placed on his desk by the Democratic majorities of the General Assembly, acts that reinforced his political identity as a centrist — an image that makes him a formidable opponent for a Republican challenger should Lamont seek a third term in 2026 — but antagonized the left of his own party.
At a press conference Monday explaining the vetoes of an affordable housing bill and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, Lamont also made an unforced error: identifying Cuomo, who resigned after a sexual harassment scandal, as his preferred candidate for mayor.
On Wednesday, Lamont praised Mamdani while noting that Democrats have hardly renounced centrists. He pointed to Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats recently nominated moderate suburban women for governor. 
But the governor readily conceded Mamdani’s win demonstrated an appetite for change — and he claimed some common ground.
“There’s a lot of frustration out there,” Lamont said. “And some of what Mamdani was saying, we’ve already done. He’s making a big down payment on universal pre-K. You know, we’re doing that as well.”
Lamont says the highlight of the recently concluded legislative session was the creation of an off-budget early childhood trust fund that will raise salaries for child care workers, increase access and provide free care for families earning no more than $100,000 and discounted care for others. 
“So I share a lot of his aspirations, where he wants to go,” Lamont said of Mamdani. “We probably get there in different ways.”
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, a candidate for governor if Lamont does not run again, said Mamdani won by talking about affordability.
“Clearly, those issues spoke to people,” Bysiewicz said.
Mamdani, who was endorsed by the union-financed Working Families Party, ran on a promise to increase affordable housing, open city-owned grocery stores and raise the city’s $16.50 hourly minimum wage to $30. 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he found Mamdani’s victory easy to analyze.
“It is so easy to see right now that people are hungry for fighters. They’re hungry for people to be authentic,” Duff said. “They’re hungry for people to stand up and give people a voice. And they may not always have to agree with you, but they will respect the fact that you stood up and you fought for them and their values.”
Lamont’s two recent vetoes put him at odds with labor, affordable housing advocates and fellow Democrats, including Duff.
His veto of the strikers bill was expected and came with a consistent and clearly stated rationale. But his veto of an affordable housing bill that had been drafted largely to his specifications infuriated lawmakers. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was bracing for hard questions about the housing veto Wednesday night at a House Democratic caucus. Ritter and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, had called the vote on the housing bill after assuring the rank-and-file Lamont was on board.
“So we’re going to get some flack from this, from people who are going to say, ‘Well, you guys said, ‘It was all set.’ And we’re going to say, ‘We thought it was all set.’ And so it’s not good for anybody,” Ritter said. “It’s not good for him, it’s not good for us.”
A leader in Connecticut For All, one of the liberal advocacy groups that have clashed with Lamont over state spending, was quick to assert that Mamdani’s win was a rebuke to Lamont and his style of governing.
“Tonight’s NYC Mayor results sent a strong message to corporate democrats like Governor Lamont — it’s time for bold leadership that centers the needs of the working class,” Constanza Segovia, an organizer, said in an emailed statement Tuesday night. “Lamont’s endorsement for an accused sexual harasser and disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo is indicative of all of his choices lately — wrong and out of touch.”
Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a liberal weighing a run for governor, was reluctant to find evidence of vulnerability by Lamont in Cuomo’s defeat — in part because of one of same factors cited by Segovia, the sexual harassment scandal that dogs the former New York governor.
“You need to be really aware of luck — and that’s not to in any way detract from that race — but I think that Mamdani got lucky to be against a truly unsympathetic competitor, where Ned is a nice guy and is really likable,” Elliott said.
Ritter had a similar take: Cuomo’s problem was less being a moderate than not getting past the scandal that led to his resignation.
“I think it’s time for him to go and retire,” Ritter said of Cuomo. “But my reasons for that are not because he’s moderate. My reasons are because of his actions.”
Comptroller Sean Scanlon,  a potential gubernatorial candidate if Lamont does not run, said he was unsure if the granular details of Mamdani’s platform were a formula path for Democrats elsewhere.
“But I certainly think he ran an incredible campaign,” Scanlon said. “And I think there is a yearning right now amongst not just Democratic voters but all voters, for young, energetic candidates that are laying out a vision for where they want to take their city or their state or the country, and focusing on affordability, which is the No. 1 issue to everybody in this country, and something that we as Democrats don’t talk about enough.”
Scanlon is a fan of “Abundance,” the new book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. As Klein recently observed on the New York Times op-ed page, “The book is largely a critique of how Democrats have governed in the places where they’ve held power.”
“His main take, and I agree with it, is that Democrats have become the party of defending institutions that most people think are broken, and explaining why things are complicated and hard, as opposed to being willing to just break things that are wrong,” Scanlon said. “And I think we have become victims of that reality and letting perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Scanlon also offered a pithier assessment.
 “I have been saying this to a lot of people today: Young plus change, plus focus on affordability — minus socialism — is the recipe for Connecticut Democrats.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SRR_0456-TRANSIT-0625-DE-140-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 05:01:56.870275

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A Maryland man facing criminal charges in Tennessee, after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, will remain in jail until at least Friday as a federal judge weighs whether prosecutors have the power to keep him from being “precipitously deported.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, appeared Wednesday in a downtown Nashville courtroom for a hearing to set the conditions of his release while a criminal case against him moves forward. 
Abrego was indicted by a Tennessee grand jury June 6 on two criminal human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment occurred while Abrego was housed in a Salvadoran prison, where U.S. immigration officials dispatched him after a routine traffic stop.
 A Department of Justice attorney later conceded Abrego’s deportation had been a mistake. His case has come to symbolize the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. 
Wearing an orange jumpsuit and seated next to his attorneys, Abrego occasionally glanced in the direction of the gallery where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, sat in the first row. It was the couple’s wedding anniversary, she told reporters earlier in the day.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to appear in court for possible release, a move federal prosecutors oppose

But as Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes went over the terms of Abregos’s pretrial release, defense attorneys raised the specter that he could instead face deportation. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are expected to take Abrego into custody immediately once he is released by the federal court. 
Sean Hecker, an attorney for Abrego, sought a decision by the judge that Abrego’s release would be conditional on prosecutors working to ensure that he would not be deported while the case remains ongoing.
Hecker also sought assurances that Abrego would not be housed in Texas, Louisiana or other parts of the country that could impede access to his attorneys.
In support of his request, Hecker noted prosecutors and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had a history of coordination and cooperation in Abrego’s case.  
DHS and federal prosecutors coordinated to bring charges against Abrego, including facilitating his return from El Salvador to face an indictment in Tennessee; they also established agreements with potential witnesses against Abrego to halt their own deportation cases, Hecker said. 
But acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire indicated he could make no promises about either Abrego’s placement in an ICE facility accessible to his attorneys or to prevent his deportation. He told the court that he would “do his best.”

“I will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, but obviously I can’t tell them what to do,” he said. McGuire noted that ICE — a department within the federal homeland security agency — is not a party to the case.
McGuire had unsuccessfully sought to keep Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who typically oversee detainees awaiting trial on federal crimes. 
In an order issued over the weekend, Holmes denied the prosecutors’ petition, ruling that Abrego had a right to release while awaiting trial.
“These are the sort of practical implications of that (the judge’s decision),” McGuire said Wednesday. 
Holmes has given attorneys until noon Friday to submit legal arguments that address the question of “what can the government do to ensure Mr. Abrego will not be precipitously deported.”
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing an appeal of Holmes’ weekend decision to release Abrego.  
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., separately on Wednesday, set a July 16 hearing day to review prosecutors’ request to revoke Abrego’s release from the custody of U.S. Marshals. 
The criminal charges Abrego faces stem from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop alleged the trip was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme in which Abrego was a paid driver who transported migrants who illegally crossed the southern border to destinations across the country.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
As Tennessee lawmakers debated a new universal voucher program earlier this year, one financial analysis projected that 65% of vouchers would go to students already enrolled in private schools.
Now, it will be impossible to determine whether that projection was accurate.
Tennessee families do not have to report their previous school enrollment in the new statewide voucher program application, a gap that will leave Tennesseans in the dark about whether the program will significantly expand private school access for public school students or send millions in public funds to students already enrolled in private schools.
State education officials won’t explain why they aren’t asking about prior enrollment, data which is regularly collected by other states administering similar voucher programs.
The Tennessee Department of Education has not responded to Chalkbeat Tennessee inquiries about the decision and whether the state intends to collect additional information in the future.
In a statement, Gov. Bill Lee’s office said the legislation enacting the program did not require the state to collect the information.
The lack of data collection on these issues is a notable departure from the state’s initial voucher program, the Education Savings Accounts initiative. The program, available in three counties since 2022, continues to require parents to report the specific school their child was previously enrolled in to apply.
The new voucher program application also does not require families to report household income if they are applying for one of the 10,000 available slots without an income cap.
Tennessee launched applications in mid-May for the program, which will provide 20,000 students with about $7,295 to spend at private schools. In the first year, half of the vouchers are set aside for families who earn below a certain income cap, with the other “universal” half open to all applicants.
Rep. Caleb Hemmer, a Democrat from Nashville who has been critical of the Lee-backed voucher program, has requested further information from state education officials about why they’re collecting less data about students in a significantly expanded program.
“Even if you’re pro-voucher, you would think you’d want some of this information so you could see where these parents are moving their kids from,” Hemmer said.
The new application stands in stark contrast to similar voucher programs around the country.
States like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and Alabama regularly collect and publish data surrounding previous school enrollment, and lawmakers have used similar data as a marker to gauge which communities the programs are reaching. In March, Alabama officials released data showing more than 66% of applicants to the program were already private school or homeschooled students. The first year Florida’s voucher program expanded, the state released data showing about 69% of students were already enrolled in private schools.
Hemmer sharply criticized the Tennessee Department of Education this week, questioning whether it was a calculated decision to “shield some of this information so they don’t have to worry about negative headlines.”
“It’s a new program, and these data collections are very crucial to understanding how and if these programs work,” Hemmer said. “This is a signature initiative of the governor. I would think the governor’s office and the Department of Education commissioner in charge of managing this would want to know everything possible in how this is operating.”
K-12 Education Subcommittee Chairman Kirk Haston, a Republican from Lobelville, said he was less concerned with the lack of prior enrollment information and suggested the new voucher application shouldn’t be compared to the previous program.
“One of the key pieces of data to me is if the funds are getting back to Tennessee taxpaying parents,” Haston said.
State officials have remained tight-lipped about many details of the EFS application process through the summer. The governor’s office has appeared closely involved in communications about the program, which has been Lee’s signature issue for many years.
In May, following media inquiries, Lee’s office and TDOE released a joint statement noting that more than 33,000 people had applied for the program.
How many applicants the state has accepted or denied is not yet clear.
The TDOE has not responded to Chalkbeat Tennessee requests this summer for how many applicants have been accepted or provided specific information on whether the department has filled 11 positions the legislature funded to help administer the voucher program.

When the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this month released its piece of a federal budget bill, Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., said it took a “commonsense approach” to the federal Supplemental Assistance to Needy Families, or SNAP program. 
However, the approach could also be seen as an unfunded mandate to states and local governments — and an attempt to hassle some of the most vulnerable off of a program meant to keep them from going hungry, critics say. 
The changes to the program colloquially known as food stamps are part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which faces a July 4 deadline. 
It would give $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. In an analysis, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
Many unaware of threats to Ohio Medicaid, advocates say

To try to pay for it, congressional Republicans want to slash federal programs for the poor. They include cuts to Medicaid that could cost 770,000 Ohioans their health coverage. 
They also include an estimated $300 billion in cuts to SNAP — by far the largest in history. That would cost millions of children, elderly, disabled and working Americans nutrition assistance, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported. About one in nine Ohioans would be among them.
Anti-hunger advocates are scrambling to keep up with whether the provisions in the Senate Agriculture committee bill will meet parliamentary muster. But they seek to shift the burden onto states in multiple ways.
One is to increase states’ share of the cost to administer the program from 50% to 75%. Another is to make states start paying a share of the program cost based on their error rates.
The two measures would work together to dramatically increase state costs and fundamentally alter the program, said Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks. 
“There are underlying, systemic threats to the benefits of every eligible person because of the way the reconciliation package is designed,” Novotny said Wednesday. “I fundamentally believe that every child — if they’re seven or 10 or 14 — if they’re in a household in need of benefits, we need to make sure they’re nourished and that we live up to the commitment that we collectively made as a country.”
The program provides debit cards for food. To qualify, Ohio recipients generally have to have net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four. Benefits averaged $6.28 per person, per day last year.
The reconciliation bill would force states to pay for part of the program on a sliding scale based on error rates. They’d have to pay starting at 5% and up depending on how often they were found to pay recipients too little or too much in benefits. 
It also would greatly increase error rates by eliminating the current tolerance for small errors — those up to $57.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and the large counties that administer the program gather information on gross income, family characteristics and living expenses to determine eligibility, and at what level. 
“It’s really complicated, but that determines what eligibility is for that household,” Novotny said. “If at any point in that process, there is any error made at all — if the benefit amount is calculated a dollar too low or a dollar too high — that will count toward the error rate. 
“Right now there’s a certain level of forgiveness because of the complexity of the calculation, but that would end. The error rate will go up. It will be impossible for a state to stay below a threshold of 5% because we’re talking about millions and millions of touches.”
If Ohio had an error rate of 6% or less — which it doesn’t, even under the current, more-tolerant system — the state would have to pay $158 million more a year into the program, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. At the top end, with an error rate of 25% or more, Ohio would have to pay $790 million more a year.
Under Ohio’s most recent, more-forgivingly calculated error rate, 15%, the state would have to come up with $473 million a year.
“An error rate is not fraud,” Novotny said. “It’s not the fault of the person applying for benefits. It’s a worker or a computer system making an error.”
In addition, by forcing states to pick up a huge additional chunk of the cost to administer the system, error rates stand to go up even further.
Ohio’s benefits system is now so under-resourced that SNAP beneficiaries face a two-to-three-hour wait time when they call to start or annually re-enroll for benefits, for their six-month check-ins, and when they need to report material changes in income, Novotny said. Adding 50% to states’ administrative burden would only increase wait times and the chances for harried workers to make mistakes, she said.
“Our system is already under a lot of duress in terms of access,” Novotny said.
She added, “People have trouble getting through the system already. That’s already part of the program. That’s not new. What the reconciliation text would do is exacerbate that in many ways. It would take away federal funding to support that process. So the state and the counties would have to invest more in just maintaining that level of service, which is already underfunded. And it would introduce additional complexity into every touch that is made with every household.”
On Tuesday, Novotny traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with aides to Ohio Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, both Republicans. She said neither official is on the Agriculture Committee and she wanted to explain how the SNAP changes would manifest in Ohio.
“We’re trying to talk to them about the impact it would have on Ohio,” she said. “It really is a serious, permanent, structural change to the program that we believe should be undertaken much more thoughtfully.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)A pair of former Democratic state lawmakers warned the General Assembly not to approve a controversial plan to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium and other sports facilities in the future. State lawmakers went ahead anyway.
The state budget, approved Wednesday afternoon, includes a provision to take ownership of unclaimed funds that have been in state custody for more than 10 years. It’s a dramatic change for the state.
To this point, Ohio has followed the broadly agreed upon best practice of holding funds in perpetuity until a claimant comes forward.

“These are funds held in trust. This is not state property,” attorney and former state Rep. Jeff Crossman argued. “These funds belong to all those hardworking Ohioans across the state with forgotten savings accounts, uncashed checks, overpaid utility bills — they’re not abandoned.”
Crossman and former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, who is also a former state senator, have put together a class action lawsuit, and they’re promising to file it immediately if the stadium funding plan gets signed into law.
“We’re not anti-stadium,” Crossman insisted. “We’re anti-theft.”
Is that legal?
Although Ohio’s proposal is a sharp departure from current state policy, it’s not the first time a state has imposed a deadline on unclaimed funds.
A small handful of states have a statutory cutoff after which funds become state property — a process known as “escheatment.” But those states wait more than twice as long as Ohio is proposing or limit the process to small dollar amounts.
Muddying the waters further, Ohio lawmakers have dipped into the unclaimed funds account several times in recent years.
The plan’s architect, state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, points to those transfers as vindication. Importantly, those previous transfers amount to borrowing money; unlike Cirino’s plan, no one lost the right to reclaim their property.
Can they do that? Ohio Senators propose novel, if questionable, Browns stadium funding plan

Crossman and Dann acknowledge it is legal for the government to take ownership of private property, but only in extraordinary circumstances. They insist the state hasn’t met that bar.
“This is an unconstitutional taking of property,” Dann argued.
He brought up a 2006 eminent domain case in Ohio called Norwood v. Horney. The city of Norwood wanted to seize dozens of homes and businesses to make way for private development. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected that effort.
“The government cannot take private property based on speculative claims of economic benefit alone,” Dann explained. “There must be a legitimate, direct public purpose. This plan fails on both fronts.”
Crossman added that while the Norwood case dealt with real estate, the court made no distinction between real property and any other.
“And let me be blunt,” he insisted, “if this plan collapses in court and delays stadium funding, it’s not going to be our fault. It’s going to be the legislature’s fault, who forced this through knowing full well that it was unconstitutional.”
What’s next?
Following his chamber’s vote, Senate President Rob McColley said “I’m confident we’re on good constitutional grounds.” He added he’s skeptical Dann and Crossman will be able to prove their clients have suffered actual damages from the changes.
“Because everybody who has money in the fund still has 10 years to come get the money,” he argued, alluding to a ten-year grace period for those whose funds are part of the first wave swept into stadium fund.
“And so there is no harm, there are no damages for those individuals,” McColley added. “So I think it’s going to be a tough case for them to prove all the way up.”
In addition to establishing a new funding stream for the Browns stadium, lawmakers added in a provision that will likely make it easier for the team to pick up stakes in Cleveland, and settle in nearby Brook Park instead. After Art Modell moved the first iteration of the Browns to Baltimore, rechristening the team as the Ravens, lawmakers placed restrictions on owners moving teams after receiving public support.
The budget tweaked that provision. It now only applies when moving a team out of state.
McColley defended the change, arguing it still requires teams fulfill the terms of their lease and that tethering the team to its current location was never the intention. “That would have been an insane intention to have when the law was passed,” he added.
“What this is doing is protecting the taxpayers,” McColley argued. “Basically saying you have to fill out your lease, you have to satisfy your obligation, and if you receive state funding, you have to remain in the state of Ohio.”
Despite criticism of the plan, lawmakers are certainly treating it as a going concern. The Senate’s budget calls for transferring $1.7 billion out of the unclaimed funds trust, but that first draft only appropriated the $600 million the Browns want for their stadium.
But after negotiations with the House, lawmakers want to appropriate a full $1 billion for sports and cultural developments. That puts $400 million at the ready for other facilities around Ohio.

“They’re saying we don’t care that you own this money,” Dann argued, “We don’t care that we’ve appointed ourselves, the state, as the fiduciary for that money. We’re going to just dump that responsibility right now and give it out to somebody who has helped us in our campaigns. That is not a constitutional process.”
Gov. Mike DeWine could always veto the provision, but to this point he has declined to take a position on using unclaimed funds. However, DeWine’s spokesman Dan Tierney criticized the preemptive lawsuit threat.
“Wow,” he said in an email. “We haven’t even received the budget bill yet, let alone the Governor having signed it. But given that the former Attorney General gave us the Sunshine Express, his need for speed shouldn’t be surprising.”
During his time as attorney general, Dann added flames to the side of a government SUV and decals dubbing it the Sunshine Express to highlight his office’s work on public records. But that SUV wound up at the shop in the first place because a staffer in Dann’s office turned it in with extensive body damage and no explanation.
But for their part, Dann and Crossman expressed some optimism that DeWine might step in.
“Republicans do not have the corner on bad ideas in this building,” Dann said, arguing Democrats have been on the wrong side of plenty of unconstitutional proposals. “Our hope is that the serious legislators and the governor who stood on these steps and swore an oath to the Constitution will decide to follow the Constitution.”
Crossman added that as a former attorney general himself, DeWine “should recognize the constitutional problems.”
“You can’t balance a budget on broken promises, and you can’t build a stadium on stolen property,” Crossman argued. “And if the legislature won’t defend Ohioans’ rights, we will.”

(Traci Brimhall)Kansas poet laureate Traci Brimhall is offering poetic sustenance to Kansas and beyond.
Brimhall, two years into her term, is busy, and her appointment has seen an outpouring of support and excitement. It is a testament to her commitment to Kansas and poetry. Brimhall’s latest poetry book, “Love Prodigal,” was shortlisted for the Julie Suk Award, which recognizes the best poetry book published in 2025 by a literary press. The Guggenheim New York, in collaboration with the Academy of American Poets, has announced Brimhall as their poet in residence for 2025. 
I’m in awe of Brimhall. She has maintained such a high level of poetic output and programming across Kansas while still serving as the director of the creative writing program at Kansas State University and teaching as a distinguished professor of English at the university.
I asked Brimhall how the laureateship has impacted her teaching and how the University has supported her new role.
  Traci Brimhall
“One really great direct benefit to my teaching is that I’ve been able to make several internships for students to help with laureate projects,” she said. “I’m glad I can fund students to do work in arts advocacy. And I am really grateful that Kansas State has been so enthusiastic about my work as laureate. Different departments have invited me to give talks; I’ve done a university podcast on food and poetry; and I gave the commencement speech for the College of Arts & Sciences last spring. I feel arts and humanities often feel overlooked in many academic spaces, and it is wonderful that a land grant institution that has a lot of agricultural focus can also see the value of the arts.”
Poetry is growing in Kansas with each event Brimhall facilitates, and there have been many. In Poetry Harvest: Poems for the 2024 Kansas State Fair, she curated new works from Kansas poets to showcase at the event, which is held annually in Hutchinson. Thematically, the poems were predominantly agrarian and included quilting, dairy, woodworking, farming, horses, flower displays, and much more. A deep pride and sense of place are apparent. 
Brimhall has stated in her op-ed about the state fair poems that she is working to “unite the state’s agricultural roots and the literary arts.”
“Since so much of my Laureate work has been about connecting food and poetry, the Kansas State Fair seemed like a natural fit!” Brimhall shared. “There are already so many exhibits about food and the arts, and I wanted to see poetry included among the other domestic arts like quilting and flower arranging. I was lucky in that both the State Fair and the Kansas Chamber of Commerce were also excited because I couldn’t have done it alone. I paired 20 Kansas poets with 20 exhibits around the fair, and we put those poems on posters that got displayed across the fair for two weeks. And we even got to organize a poetry reading on one of the stages!”
She continues bringing poets to the table. During one library talk, the community had a potluck lunch. That’s further evidence of the cultivation of care that arises from within the places Brimhall visits.
“Southwest Kansas! A library did a potluck lunch to feed everyone, and someone told me that they were afraid of poetry before my talk,” she said. “They also said that my recipe cards for poetry lines helped them write their very first poem. That felt really special, and I hope they write many, many more poems.” 
Community through communion is how Brimhall is bringing the culinary and literary arts together. There is nourishment and fulfillment to be found in her work. Her most recent creative endeavor is a poetry cookbook.
“I wanted to connect more culinary arts with the literary arts, so I asked 20 chefs across Kansas to contribute recipes,” Brimhall said. “There are food trucks and farms and restaurateurs and Netflix chefs all participating and offering recipes. I asked them to make the recipes accessible for all Kansan — so economically accessible and easily sourced. Ten percent of the cookbook copies will be donated to food banks across the state. I then paired 20 poets with those 20 recipes and had them write response poems.”
Meadowlark Press, a Kansas press in Emporia, is publishing “Eat Your Words: A Kansas Poetry Cookbook.” That’s intentional.
“For me, it was important that all the funds go to supporting Kansas literary endeavors,” Brimhall said. “I want to see our State’s arts economy thrive.”
Brimhall is in full stride as she continues to travel across the state with poetry in hand. And I am beyond excited to read her latest collection of poetry, “Love Prodigal” (Copper Canyon Press, 2024). 
In a stunning interview on KPR Presents, Brimhall spoke about her latest book and shared that she wants “love to be the energy that fuels her art.” It’s apparent to me that at the center of her work is love. We are fortunate to have Traci Brimhall as our state’s poet laureate. She is pouring so much care into Kansas in the form of a poem. I look forward to what the next two years will bring.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)For those who care about the future of life on earth and the destiny of our children, there is nothing more frightening than watching the fossil fuel greed-induced blindness of Trump and the MAGA cult ruthlessly wiping out every single gain toward preventing a climate collapse and opening the door to a deadly acceleration of carbon emissions. 
It is no time to mince words, we are witnessing nothing less than the last chance to prevent the overwhelming suffering of literally hundreds of millions of our own children and future generations as the life support systems of the planet are irreparably crushed.
Here in Ohio we have our own version of this horrendous scenario playing out. 
Seemingly blinded by greed to the point where they do not even see the consequences for their very own children, fossil fuel interests in our state — aided and abetted by similarly blinded Republicans in the Ohio Statehouse — have now embarked on an effort to do no less than completely shut down utility scale solar projects. 
They are doing so through two primary vehicles. One is to use their exorbitant wealth to spread distortions and misinformation to the public in areas where solar projects are proposed. 
The second is to infiltrate their influence directly into the agency that makes solar project siting decisions — the Ohio Power Siting board (OPSB) — and skew the process so radically that pro-solar advocates are left with hardly any chance to ever win.
In this running battle over the green future of Ohio, one area that stands out in importance is the Frasier solar project in Knox County. 
It does so because nowhere else in the state have the lines of the conflict been drawn more clearly. It started with the fossil fuel industry blatantly jumping into the fray without even any real attempt to conceal its identity. 
As is usually the case, it formed a local “front group” — called “Knox Smart Development” — but it was obvious where the money and propaganda were coming from.
While trying to ban anyone from outside the county to even testify, they invited a speaker all the way from Chicago to attend a so-called “town hall” meeting where the climate crisis was characterized as a complete hoax. 
He came from the Heartland Institute — the very same source hired by the tobacco industry to spread lies about smoking not being a danger to health.  
In this same “town hall” — the concept known for democratically allowing all points of view — a speaker who came to present a pro-solar view was actually denied entry.   
Next was the extreme step of actually purchasing the local newspaper so it could be used as a tool to spread misinformation. 
This was exposed by a national group called ProPublica — which has actually won the coveted Pulitzer Prize for the excellence of its investigative work. 
All this manipulation was not allowed to hide in the dark. Not only were commentaries published here in the Capital Journal, but a documentary to expose the corruption was produced by this writer and distributed throughout the county.

But the Frasier battle is also notable because it will put to the test two strategies that are now becoming prominent in the effort to shut down utility scale solar. 
The first is the manipulative claim that agricultural land is being “taken out of production.” 
The solar developer for Frasier — Open Road Renewables — has designed the project so that sheep grazing will be integrated into almost the entire acreage. Continued agricultural use has now been specifically designed into the project. 
Yet the opposition continues to hold the signs and yell the same words despite the point now being rendered meaningless. Will they be allowed to get away with this?
Frasier will also crystallize whether the attempt by fossil fuel interests to skew the entire decision process will be successful. 
They are doing so by getting the Ohio Power Siting Board to essentially grant “veto power” over projects to a small handful of local officials — despite the fact there’s actually a state statute that prohibits the granting of such local jurisdiction.  
Even more unbelievably, these local officials are not even being asked to present *any rationale* whatsoever for *WHY*  they oppose a project.
All they do is say no, and the extra power they have been given results in the project being rejected. 
It is the antithesis of a democratic process. 
Fossil fuel pressure can be applied to just a few select individuals and once they are “locked” into the opposition, not even a majority of the public has any ability to affect the outcome. 
The power siting board has objected to calling this a “rigging” of the process. But in all honesty what else can it be called? The legality of this bald-faced power grab is now being deliberated at the Ohio Supreme Court.   
Ohio is not just one state among many. 
It is the fifth most prolific producer of carbon emissions, placing an immense weight of responsibility on our shoulders related to our children and future generations. 
Jake Zuckerman reported for Cleveland.com in March: “Ohioans and their elected representatives have killed enough solar development to roughly power the state’s three largest cities in the three years since state lawmakers passed one of the nation’s most stringent restrictions on new solar development.”
The stakes are high, and our planet is currently losing. 
The Ohio Power Siting Board cannot claim ignorance of the issues. It has acknowledged that these concerns about skewing the process have been raised. In the name of our collective future, it must change course.

The budget now heads to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk for his signature, which he must sign by June 30. He can line-item veto provisions in the budget. 
Anti-LGBTQ provisions 
A handful of anti-LGBTQ+ provisions are sprinkled throughout the budget, including a provision that would only recognize two sexes — male and female.

“Do we really have to make a law that says that men are men and women are women?” state Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, asked. “Do we really have to define that? We shouldn’t have to, but apparently we do.”
The budget would require public libraries to put books related to sexual orientation or gender identity in an area of the library that is out of sight for minors. 
“If moms and dads want their kids to be indoctrinated within that, that’s up to the moms and dads, but we’re not going to put it in children’s faces in the children’s sections of the libraries,” Click said. 
Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, called out the library provision. 
“If you are one of the 20% of young people who identify as LGBTQ, you’re not going to be a hero in that story,” he said. “We have to have more books that show you as a leader, as a champion, as a hero.”
The budget would also ban Pride flags from being flown at public buildings and prohibit giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
“We are not hanging out the welcome mat for people from the LGBTQ community,” said Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood. “We should be a place where folks can just be who they are authentically and live and let live.”
Higher education provisions 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship awards the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to attend an Ohio college or university. 
Under the final version of the budget, scholarship recipients must sign a statement of commitment to live in Ohio for three years immediately after graduation starting in fiscal year 2027. 
“If we want our young people to stay in Ohio, to start their careers in Ohio, to start a family in Ohio, we need to put our money where our mouth is, and we are doing that in this budget,” said Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville. 
The Senate’s version of the budget would have required scholarship recipients sign a promissory note, but the final version of the budget instead requires students to sign a statement of commitment to live in Ohio for the first three years after graduating college. 
“It was deemed (the promissory note) was a little bit heavy-handed and so we tried to roll that back,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon said. 
The budget allocates $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million in fiscal year 2027 for the Governor’s Merit Scholarship. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship. Eighty-seven percent of Ohio students accepted the scholarship in its second year and 11 rural counties had a 100% acceptance rate. 
The budget ties a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with Senate Bill 1, a new higher education law banning diversity efforts, creates post-tenure reviews and an American civic literacy course, among other things. 
The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges and each university must submit a report showing compliance to the House and Senate higher education committees by March 1, according to the budget. 
Housing provisions 
The budget kept housing provisions the Senate added to the budget — $90 for the Residential Development Revolving Loan Program and $10 million for the Residential Economic Development District. 
The Residential Development Revolving Loan Program supports new, single-family residential homes in rural areas of the state. 
“If we want to grow our population, we have to have places for folks to live,” Stewart said. “This is going to be directed to small counties. We can’t be growing housing just in the three C’s, we need to be growing housing all across Ohio.”

After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
Uber, Lyft oppose some bills that aim to prevent assaults during rides

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
Thousands are suing states over sexual abuse in juvenile detention facilities

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sexual assault survivors can now track their rape kits in most states

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Taylor, in which a group of Montgomery County parents are suing for the right to take their children out of classes that have LGBTQ-themed books. (Photo by Nathan O’Neal/Cronkite News)The Supreme Court case Mahmoud v. Taylor has already been cast in stark moral terms: On one side, a public school district trying to foster inclusion and tolerance; on the other, a group of religious parents resisting progress.
But this case is not about banning books or rejecting diversity. It is about whether parents have a limited right to excuse their young children from specific public school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs. That’s a First Amendment question — not a culture war skirmish — and it deserves to be treated as such.
The families challenging Montgomery County schools are Muslim, Christian and Jewish. Their children attend elementary school, where a handful of picture books featuring same-sex couples and discussions of gender identity are used in literacy lessons. The parents are not asking that these books be removed. They are asking for notice and the opportunity to opt out of particular lessons, so they can address those topics at home, in accordance with their faith.
The district initially allowed such accommodations. Then it reversed course. No more opt-outs, not even for kindergartners.
The district says its curriculum reflects its commitment to inclusivity, and that letting  families withdraw from certain lessons could undermine that goal. But the parents are not asking the state to affirm their beliefs — only to give them space to raise their children without contradiction from mandatory school messaging.

We’ve seen versions of this question before. In West Virginia v. Barnette (1943), the Supreme Court ruled that public schools could not force students to salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance. In Abington v. Schempp (1963), the court barred mandatory Bible readings in public classrooms. Though the content in those cases differed, the principle was the same: Public schools may not compel students to participate in messages that contradict their convictions.
The message in Mahmoud is not patriotic or religious, but it still carries moral weight. The lessons are designed to promote inclusion and affirm diverse identities and family structures. The question is whether families may decline to participate when those lessons conflict with their religious beliefs.
The district allows opt-outs in other contexts — for example, when students object to religious songs in choir or to depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in literature. But it has drawn a hard line at objections from religious families responding to LGBTQ-themed books. As Justice Gorsuch noted, when the government allows some exceptions and not others, it raises concerns about religious discrimination.
In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021), the court held that when a policy allows officials to grant exemptions, it cannot deny a religious exemption unless it can meet the highest standard of constitutional scrutiny. That reaffirmed a core principle of the free exercise clause: When government creates space for individualized judgment, it must treat religious claims with the same respect it gives to others.
Understandably, some worry about a slippery slope. If parents can opt out of LGBTQ-inclusive material, what about civil rights history, feminism, or even basic science? That concern is real, but not new. Courts have long been able to distinguish between good-faith conscience-based requests and efforts to undermine public education.
The deeper problem is that we increasingly treat constitutional questions like Mahmoud as moral referenda. Once a case is framed as progress versus prejudice, there’s no room left for pluralism. Disagreement is interpreted as hostility. Rights become conditional on political alignment.
Yet the genius of the First Amendment is that it protects conscience across lines of ideology. If secular parents have the right to object to religious instruction in schools then religious parents should have the right to seek limited accommodation from secular messaging that conflicts with their faith.
You do not need to agree with the parents’ theology to understand why their rights matter. If public education is to serve a pluralistic society, it must allow space for real moral diversity. That includes LGBTQ students and families, and it also includes those whose beliefs about family and identity are shaped by longstanding religious traditions.
The court’s decision in Mahmoud could help reestablish that balance. But for the conversation to move forward, we must first abandon the assumption that all dissent is an attack. Sometimes it is simply an act of conscience. And in a constitutional democracy, we are supposed to protect that — even, and especially, when we disagree with it.  Stories default to familiar caricatures, offering little to promote a nuanced understanding of the complexity of the case. Mahmoud provides an opportunity to tell a new and better story — of a society in which deeply held differences can coexist.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/scotusfacade-1024.jpg,,,2025-06-26 03:00:36.086112

(Screenshot from Court TV)House lawmakers grappled Wednesday to find a path forward on a report that dozens of police-custody deaths previously ruled accidental or of unknown causes by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner have been reclassified as homicides.
The report, the result of a four-year review of 1,300 cases between 2003 and 2019, was presented to the House Judiciary Committee by Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and Towson University psychology professor Jeff Kukucka, who led the audit.
It revealed the potential of racial and pro-police biases in the office led by former Medical Examiner David Fowler that led to the incorrect characterization of some deaths as accidental. The report, originally released last month, included several recommendations, most of which are administrative, Brown said.
“None of the recommendations require legislation,” Brown said. But, “they all could be done by legislation. If you’re going that path, we respectfully ask that we’d be involved to help shape that.”
Judiciary Committee Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) said the committee would likely meet again to discuss the issues, if not before the start of the 2026 General Assembly session, then shortly thereafter.
The hearing was the latest in the sudden unraveling of the legacy of the office under Fowler, who led it form 2003 to 2019, when he resigned.
Questions arouse after Fowler was called as an expert witness in the trial of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, a white police officer who was ultimately convicted of murder in the May 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in police custody. As part of Floyd’s arrest, Chauvin knelt for up to nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, who said repeatedly that he could not breathe.
Medical examiner audit reclassifies dozens of police-restraint deaths as homicides

Local autopsies determined that Floyd’s death — captured by witnesses on cellphone video that went viral — was a homicide.But Fowler testified that he would have ruled Floyd’s death caused by “excited delirium” rather than police actions.
Excited delirium was a catchall term used to describe aggressive behaviors related to mental health or substance abuse issues. It has been disavowed by the American Medical Association and the National Association of Medical Examiners, and Kukucka said Wednesday that it has since been abandoned by Maryland’s medical examiner’s office.
Fowler’s testimony triggered outrage, and a 2021 letter signed by 450 medical experts called on Maryland officials to reexamine deaths in police custody and medical examiner’s office practices under Fowler.
That audit involved independent review of Maryland cases by a dozen forensic pathologists around the globe, who determined that 48  police-custody deaths during Fowler’s tenure should be reclassified as homicides. The audit said 32 of the 48 cases reclassified as homicides involved victims who were Black, the other 16 were white.
The reviewers determined that the office was more likely to determine a death was homicide if the victim was white, at 44%, but only 16% if the person who died was Black.
“As AG Brown mentioned, it’s a pattern that is consistent with the possibility of racial bias,” Kukucka said. “That homicides are being under-counted in general, but they’re being under-counted even more dramatically if the decedent is Black.”
Kukucka also said the medical examiner’s office certified 14% of restraint deaths as homicides when police were involved, but that nearly quadrupled, to 54%, if the restraint was applied by a security guard, emergency medical personnel, or some other individual who was not a police officer.
Kukucka and Brown reiterated the findings do not imply criminal wrongdoing or liability. But an executive order issued by Gov. Wes Moore (D) directed the attorney general’s office to work with local state’s attorneys to review each case.

“We will determine whether reinvestigation is warranted in these matters,” Brown said. He later said if a case would need to be reopened, that’s “if, and only a big capital, bold if, there was evidence that suggested prosecution.”
Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger (D) said in a brief interview Wednesday afternoon any cases referred to his office will be reviewed that “might change the status of a case.”
“It’s going to take a bit [of time] because we’ve got to put together the files again,” Shellenberger said. “We’ll have to really do some digging.”
Legislation not needed, but…
During the virtual committee hearing, Del. Robin Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County) asked the researchers defined homicide.
Kukucka used an example of a hunter who shoots at game, but misses the animal and accidentally shoots and kills another hunter. From a death investigation standpoint, he said “that death is a homicide.”
“So how does the office of the chief medical examiner differentiate between an accident and a homicide?” Grammer asked. “Where’s the actual different difference here? Because it could be accidental when a person dies, and now you’re subject to felony murder, or if it’s negligence, maybe manslaughter.”
Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County) asked Brown if any of the audit’s recommendations should be codified into legislation.
Some of the recommendations included requiring better quality autopsy photos from the medical examiner’s office (some were black-and-whites); sending mental health experts on some emergency responses; and reviewing audit cases the pathologists determined a cause of death to be a homicide.
Brown said the recommendations can be handled administratively such as through the medical examiner’s office or the state Department of Health.
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the committee, asked about a recommendation to conduct a follow-up audit in another five years. Bartlett asked why not sooner, especially with the biases noted in the audit.
Kukucka said five years provides more time to collect data to conduct a comprehensive audit.
“After two or three years, there may simply not be enough cases to draw firm conclusions,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-14-132-1-1024x640.png,,,2025-06-26 01:59:10.512272

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

I was one of more than 1,100 volunteers from all 50 states who gathered at the 2025 Alzheimer’s Impact Movement (AIM) Advocacy Forum. Hosted by the Alzheimer’s Association’s advocacy arm, the forum is an annual three-day event that brings together people like me – people with personal stories, loved ones lost, and a deep drive to make change.

Erin Mahoney in Washington, D.C. 
This year, our Connecticut delegation included ten passionate advocates from across the state. On the final day of the forum, we went to Capitol Hill and met with our Connecticut members of Congress to share our experiences and ask for their support.
I advocate in memory of my mother, who died of younger-onset Alzheimer’s in 2018 at just 65 years old. She was vibrant, funny, and brilliant — the kind of person who lit up a room. But Alzheimer’s slowly stole her from us, piece by piece. I watched my mother, once fiercely independent, lose her words, her ability to care for herself and eventually, her life. The grief of that loss never fully fades. But I’ve learned to channel it into purpose.
Each year, I return to D.C. not just for her – but for the millions of Americans living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and the caregivers who carry so much of the burden, often in silence. In Connecticut alone, over 80,000 people are living with Alzheimer’s, and more than 100,000 unpaid caregivers provide support to loved ones. This is a public health crisis hiding in plain sight.
At the forum, we asked our members of Congress to support increased research funding through the National Institutes of Health, continued funding for the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, protections for Medicaid coverage, and access to affordable and timely diagnostic tools — including coverage for biomarker testing. We also advocated for better education and training for primary care providers, who are often the first point of contact for families facing a dementia diagnosis.
This is emotional work and not always easy. I’ve spent years sharing my story, following up with offices, and posting about advocacy on social media. I keep going because I know the silence around this disease is part of what allows it to persist.
If I’ve learned anything, it’s that the most powerful change doesn’t always start in headlines or press conferences. It starts in living rooms and support groups, in the quiet hands of caregivers, and in stories shared on Capitol Hill. Advocacy is often invisible labor – but that doesn’t make it less important.
I hope Connecticut’s lawmakers continue to lead the way in this fight. Alzheimer’s doesn’t care who you are, where you live, or what party you belong to. It steals futures and fractures families – and the time to act is now.
Until there’s a cure, we need compassion. We need resources. And we need to keep showing up.

It is incumbent upon us as food justice advocates and caring citizens to express our concern regarding billions of dollars in proposed cuts and administrative changes to nutrition assistance programs, most critically, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
We denounce actions taken to ﬁnd savings for the budget reconciliation bill from reforms to SNAP, such as stronger work requirements and cost-sharing with states. Cutting into nutrition assistance programs further compromises democratic principles already in peril.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other food security measures, including the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), emerged in the 1940s after World War II with a complex set of objectives. These programs initially served, in part, to manage overproduced commodities through charity-based food and nutrition security systems, but did so within a framework that has inadvertently contributed to the growth of ‘Big Ag’ and ‘Big Food.’ 
Despite their complex intent, these programs address critical issues like hunger and malnutrition, stimulate economic development, help prevent social unrest, and contribute to a more peaceful society. Serving mostly children and seniors, SNAP and NSLP stand as the country’s largest and second-largest food security safety-nets. 
As a nation bound by our shared responsibility for one another’s welfare, we must protect these programs from any endangerment and recognize their role in preserving peace, nourishing our most vulnerable populations, and strengthening our democracy.
Connecticut faces a deepening food insecurity crisis. The 2025 Map the Meal Gap report reveals that one in seven Connecticut residents, or 14.3% of the state’s population, are food insecure. This translates to over 516,000 people struggling with hunger, a concerning increase of more than 10% from the previous year. Jason Jakubowski, President and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare, underscores the severity of the situation, stating, “The new Map the Meal Gap report conﬁrms that food insecurity is getting worse in Connecticut and it’s getting harder to address.”
In 2024, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provided a crucial safety net for nearly 400,000 Connecticut residents, representing one in nine state residents. A total of $885 million in SNAP beneﬁts were disbursed that year. However, it is important to recognize that many recipients received limited assistance, with some seniors’ monthly beneﬁts amounting to as little as $60.
SNAP serves as a powerful economic driver. Every dollar invested in SNAP generates up to $1.80 in economic activity. Furthermore, SNAP oﬀers vital market support to farmers and small businesses while promoting the physical and mental well-being of seniors and individuals with disabilities.
However, SNAP does more than just help with food; it’s a gateway to other essential services. When families lose their SNAP beneﬁts, their children also lose automatic qualiﬁcation for free school meals. Meg Zimmerman, Program Manager at End Hunger CT!, emphasizes this crucial connection: “SNAP is not only the most eﬀective anti-hunger program in the country, but it’s also a key pathway to other anti-hunger programs, such as free school meals.” She explains that schools use data-matching to identify students who receive SNAP and automatically enroll them in free school meal programs. This automatic certiﬁcation is highly eﬃcient, saving administrative time and money. However, if families are cut oﬀ from SNAP, fewer children will be directly certiﬁed for school meals, meaning eligible kids could slip through the cracks and go without access to proper nutrition.
We ask that our U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal  embrace a new vision, alongside food and farm assistance programs, that are led by communities empowered by their own food, land and watershed sovereignty.
Connecticut is fortunate to have a diverse coalition, predominantly Black and Brown farmers, growers, food entrepreneurs and policy advocates who are leading a movement towards an equitable, just, resilient and regionalized food system rooted in interdependent relationships.
The charitable food system is stretched thin. Food banks and pantries cannot shoulder the responsibility of unprecedented levels of food insecurity, especially as diminishing federal food and farm assistance programs compound an already fraught system. We all must employ our imaginations and pave pathways towards a food culture where access to food, land and watersheds is upheld as a human right.
We invite you to join us as a food system changemaker and uplift the following programs – although by no means an exclusive list:


Federal Policy/Programs such as: Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement (LFPA) Local Food For School Cooperative Agreement Program (LFSA) and the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) and the Land Capital Market Access Program (LCMAP)
State Policy/Programs such as: School Meals For All CT, Local Food For Local Schools Incentive Program, CT Grown For CT Kids Grant and Food Recovery Initiatives
Community-Based Organizations such as: Liberated Land Cooperative, Sovereign Land Trust, Fairgate Community Farm, Green Village Initiative, Brass City Harvest, Northwest CT Food Hub, CT Farm To School Collaborative and New Connecticut Farmer Alliance

We must underscore the profound value and potential that lies in the synergy between federal and state policy programs and community-based organizations. This interconnectedness is critical for eliminating not only food insecurity, but the diverse social, economic, and ecological issues that are direct consequences of the industrial food system’s detrimental impacts. 
We ask that Murphy and Blumenthal use their position of inﬂuence, and power, to support these programs and to integrate them into their narrative around a larger vision for a democratic society. Transformation in the food system, informed and guided by said programs, will lead us towards the creative connections, authentic well being, thriving communities and stronger democracy we all long for.
We are grateful for their representation and sincerely thank them for their courage in defending our democracy at a time rife with challenges.

Jared Polis speaks at the Colorado Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A Denver judge on Wednesday blocked the Colorado governor’s office from forcing a state employee to hand over records to federal immigration authorities on 35 sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant children in the state.
The information was sought in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena from April.
The preliminary injunction, handed down by Denver District Court Judge A. Bruce Jones, applies only to Scott Moss and staffers in the Division of Labor Standards and Statistics within the state’s labor department. Moss is the division’s director.
“I will not enjoin the governor from otherwise responding to this subpoena if that’s what he wants to do,” Jones said. “And it’s not to say that there isn’t some other workaround where somebody could ask one of his supervisees to do something and they do it. I’m not enjoining them from doing it. I’m enjoining the governor from requiring that they do it.”

The ICE subpoena seeks personal information, such as addresses, telephone numbers, emails and employment history, on 35 sponsors of immigrant children, purportedly in order to check on the children’s welfare and investigate any potential child abuse. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, decided to comply with the subpoena in late May after some deliberation.
That’s when Moss filed a lawsuit against Polis alleging that disclosing the data would violate a state law against data sharing with ICE unless it is for a criminal investigation or under a judge-signed subpoena. Moss’ lawyers argued in court this week that the subpoena does not fit that standard because it does not point to any specific, ongoing criminal investigation and could be an attempt from federal immigration authorities to find the names and addresses of people to put in deportation proceedings.
“It’s essentially a fishing expedition,” Moss lawyer Laura Wolf said in court on Monday.
In his testimony, Moss said that during an April 29 meeting with representatives from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, the attorney general’s office and the governor’s office, “nobody expressed the view that the production should be made in light” of the state law.
“We all agreed that if there were concerns about child welfare, those should be looked into by appropriate folks. But we all agreed that we had not seen any evidence of any harm to children,” Moss said. “If we had any evidence, it could be routed the appropriate way. There are state and local agencies that cover such things.”
CDLE director Joe Barela then told Moss in late May that Polis had changed his mind and wanted to produce the records requested by the subpoena.
“He said that the governor didn’t want to be accused of not helping ICE prevent any harm that might be happening to any children,” Moss said Tuesday in court. “He said that the governor … thought that the criminal exception (in the law) … gave him ‘cover.’”
Polis’ lawyers argued this week that the subpoena related to criminal matters, and that Moss was not at risk professionally if he decided not to tell his employees to produce the information. That could have meant Barela, or some other official, would make the order.
“But the statute isn’t about protecting me personally. It’s about protecting the individuals named from having their (personal identifying information) released in a potentially injurious way. It wouldn’t make me feel any better if, to save me from the trouble, other state employees would have this thrust upon them,” Moss said Tuesday.
Colorado in recent years has enacted state laws, including legislation signed in 2021 and earlier this year, that limit the sharing of data about immigrants with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Two unions that represent state employees, Colorado WINS and AFL-CIO, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said the governor’s office is reviewing next steps.
“We will abide by the court’s decision as we have always said we would,” she wrote in an email. “Governor Polis remains committed to fully and promptly cooperating with federal criminal investigations into child trafficking and exploitation, while protecting unaccompanied children in Colorado. We hope if information is needed for criminal investigations, that going forward (Homeland Security Investigations) will provide subpoenas for state information consistent with this ruling.”
Polis has repeatedly said that he welcomes federal help to detain and deport “dangerous criminals.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)I have only lived in Alaska for 24 years, but have a lifetime of Alaskan adventure under my belt. During my time here I have worked as a biologist, field archaeologist, lodge owner and wilderness guide. In my off time, I have explored thousands of miles by dog team training for and running the Iditarod and Yukon Quest among other races, floated hundreds of miles of wild rivers, and hiked hundreds of miles of tough terrain. I have filled my family’s freezer yearly from the abundant fish, wild game and berries this land has to offer … every single one of these activities have been done almost exclusively on our public lands. Public lands are more than lines on a map, as Alaskans, we are tied to the land for food, economic benefit and recreation. These public lands are our shared inheritance, our greatest privilege — and our most fragile asset. 
So when Congress tries to sell them out from under us, we pay attention.
Buried in the Senate Budget Reconciliation Bill, H.R.1, is a clause that originally would have mandated that the federal government make between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres for over 250 million acres of public lands available for sale. That includes drawing from at least 82 million acres in Alaska alone. You can view these lands on a chillingly detailed interactive ArcGIS map. While the Senate parliamentarian removed this provision, at least one senator is seeking to revive it.
Under the original plan, you may find some of your favorite places in Alaska illuminated like a for-sale sign in our front yards. I see sections of the Iditarod and Yukon Quest trail, ready to be blocked, I see my little private remote lodge property completely surrounded by lands to give away, I see the spots where my family gets its food, I see the spots where we take clients on dog mushing expeditions. Mainly, I see my Alaskan life being erased by senators with no clue what these lands mean to many. 
Supporters of this public lands sell-off frame it as a way to reduce the federal deficit, return lands to the people, and to create “affordable housing.”  But Alaskans are too smart to fall for that. These lands already belong to the people. Selling them is not “returning” them — it’s liquidating them. For private interests. Forever. The majority of these lands in Alaska are far from population centers and any housing that would be created would be far from affordable. New housing developments would need roads, infrastructure, and services which currently do not exist. Eligible lands close to population centers are already heavily used for recreational purposes and bring immense benefits to these communities.
What do we get in exchange? Practically nothing. According to the Wilderness Society, the estimated revenue from these sales is negligible compared to the $459 billion that outdoor recreation contributes annually to the U.S. economy. Alaska’s share of that pie is substantial. Our guiding businesses, lodges, outdoor gear shops, bush pilots, and even small-town gas stations and restaurants depend on the access and abundance that public lands provide.
The loss goes far beyond economics. Once these lands are privatized, access is likely to be shut off. No more family hikes to berry patches, no more hunting camp with the friends, no more snowmachine access across snow-covered valleys. Subsistence communities — especially Alaska Native villages already navigating land constraints — would bear the brunt of these closures. It’s a direct threat to food security and cultural traditions. 
Maps published by Field & Stream, Outside Magazine, and High Country News show just how widespread this threat is. From the Brooks Range to the Wrangells, from Interior trapping trails to Southeast’s Sitka Blacktail country, the lands on the chopping block are your lands. And the  proposal was not vague. The text of H.R.1,Section 20305, explicitly instructs the Department of the Interior to identify federal lands “suitable for disposal” — a designation often made with little regard for public recreational use, hunting and habitat value, or subsistence rights.
This is not the first time we’ve had to defend public lands from attack—and it won’t be the last. But the scale of this threat is historic. Alaska has more public land at stake than any other state and this isn’t stopped now, we risk losing access to the very places that define who we are.
This really is a nonpartisan issue. Every outdoor enthusiast in Alaska is a public land owner and should be paying attention.  Millions of acres of Alaskan opportunity are at risk of being able to be sold to the highest bidder. Alaskans will not trade 100-year access for a one-time payout. Our lands are not a budget line. They’re a birthright. They are what makes us Alaskan.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis-Pool/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Democratic leaders rallied Wednesday against the congressional budget and tax cut bill, fearing changes to the national food assistance program will blow holes in state budgets and leave Americans hungry.
Four Democratic governors and two U.S. senators slammed the proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which they referred to as “ugly” and a “big beautiful betrayal of a bill” during a press call.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota led the call. She and U.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Laura Kelly of Kansas and Matt Meyer of Delaware took turns lambasting the Republican legislation.
“I’m very concerned about not only the money that this is going to cost but also the chaos that it’s going to create for so many people who will just give up and end up going hungry,” Kelly said.
The Democrats told stories of seniors, children, veterans and families who they worry will suffer as a result of cuts.
“They’re going to have that pain in their stomachs and throughout their body when they’re trying to go to bed or when they’re waking up in the morning of not having enough to eat,” Beshear said.
The bill changes by the day. Recent modifications from the U.S. Senate would require states to contribute a combined $128 billion to the federal food assistance program, which historically has been fully funded by the federal government. States would be required to contribute more money, the higher their payment error rates. States currently contribute half of administrative costs, but another provision in the bill seeks to reduce the federal government’s share by $27 billion, or 25%, creating additional costs for states.
The changes to SNAP from the Senate are multifold, but many are driven by cost-cutting measures and restricting eligibility.
The current proposal would bolster work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries and restrict eligibility for people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. Both provisions are designed to save the government almost $100 billion by making benefits more difficult to access for low-income families. The proposal also could eliminate internet expenses from utility benefit calculations, reducing the amount of money beneficiaries receive each month. That change is expected to save the government $11 billion.
The Democrats criticized Republicans for touting the bill as cutting costs while it is projected to add $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in the next decade.
Two of the bill’s food-benefits provisions — the state contribution requirement and restricted eligibility for immigrants who aren’t lawful permanent residents of the U.S. — broke a Senate rule, according to the budget committee. Those provisions either need to be fixed or, if left in, will be subject to a 60-vote threshold.
“That has not deterred the Republican leadership from continuing to search for workarounds, and apparently have found one,” said Kelly.
Republicans recently adjusted the language of the state contribution provision, and the Senate parliamentarian took it under review
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate rules and agriculture committees, anticipated word on whether the new language violates a Senate rule by Thursday. Regardless, she said, Democrats intend to oppose the bill.
Most of the bill’s funding is a result of shifting costs in the billions to states, she said.
The majority of states have balanced budget rules, Klobuchar said, “so they would be forced to choose: pay for food assistance or reduce law enforcement, reduce education or reduce health care.”
Klobuchar quoted a letter Democratic governors sent Tuesday to congressional leadership, explaining their qualms with states taking on SNAP costs.
“These cuts from Congress don’t just increase state costs,” the letter said, “they make it nearly impossible for states to effectively plan for these long-term budget impacts.”
Most states have already finalized budgets ahead of the June 30 end date of the 2025 fiscal year.
Klobuchar said 4 million Americans will lose SNAP benefits as a result of the bill, which includes 1 million seniors, 800,000 parents with school-age children and 1.4 million people who live in areas where finding a job is difficult.
SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6.20 per person per day. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to more than 42 million people across the country. Around 115,000 Delawareans, 186,000 Kansans, 700,000 Kentuckians, 1.1 million Massachusetts residents and 360,000 Minnesotans receive monthly SNAP benefits as of March, according to preliminary estimates from the USDA.
Healey, of Massachusetts, said that for every one meal that a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine.
States don’t have the resources to fill gaps left behind by the proposed cuts, she said.
Kelly estimated Kansas, in administrative costs alone, will have to find more than $15 million per year to operate SNAP, which she called a conservative estimate. She expected Kansans in need will lose their benefits, especially if bolstered work requirements pass. She said they sound “really good” in theory, but worried the requirements and reporting will create hurdles for people who are “legitimately qualified” for benefits.
“We’re going to see the same thing happen with SNAP that we saw with Medicaid in states that were forced to, or did, put in work requirements,” she said.
Beshear drew a connection between the bill’s SNAP provisions and similar cuts that would weaken funding to rural hospitals. Kentucky has the highest number in the nation of rural hospitals at risk, with 35 facing closure. Beshear said those hospitals are often major employers. If rural hospitals close as a result of the bill, he said, Kentuckians are more likely to fall on hard times and turn to assistance programs like SNAP for help. But the proposed cuts to SNAP will make that more difficult, he said. Beshear criticized the cuts through the lens of religion, reciting the biblical story of the loaves and fishes.
“In a country where we grow enough food so that no one has to go hungry,” he said, “no one should go hungry.”
