However, one has attracted more spending than the other. 
 
Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	As of the most recent round of pre-election campaign finance filing reports, which were due last Friday, a proposal to modify state election laws including requiring photo identification to vote has drawn more than $2 million in cash contributions. Comparatively, Question 2, which proposes a red flag law, has raised just shy of $635,000.
Data submitted last Friday reported activity through Oct. 21, but in the days leading up to the election ballot question committees are expected to file additional reports of single contributions of $5,000 or more or single expenditures of at least $1,000.
Question 1 
Question 1 on Tuesday’s ballot will ask Maine voters whether they want to require photo identification to be shown at polling places, in addition to limiting absentee voting and a multitude of other changes to the state’s election law. 
It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?” 
Based on the filings through Oct. 21, nearly $1.8 million has been raised in opposition to the measure while supporters have raised more than $585,000. 
“The fundraising success that we’ve had demonstrates how important protecting absentee voting is to a lot of people in the state,” said David Farmer, campaign manager for the effort to oppose Question 1, which includes more than 30 different organizations. 
With the opposition having raised more than three times as much as proponents, Alex Titcomb, the lead petitioner of the ballot question committee Voter ID for ME, highlighted the money coming from sources outside of Maine.
For example, between Oct. 1 and 21, the Save Maine Absentee Voting committee raised nearly $95,000, with more than $70,000 coming from out-of-state donors and national organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Service Employees International Union. The National Education Association has also been a major contributor to the campaign, including with a $100,000 contribution on Oct. 22. 
But there have also been sizable donations from in-state organizations to oppose the campaign. For example, Maine Voices Network, a nonprofit civic engagement organization, contributed $20,000 last week after the last filing window.
Out-of-state money is also flowing in support of Question 1. Voter ID for ME raised more than $47,000 between Oct. 1 and the filing deadline, including $25,000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee PAC. In total, the Washington D.C.-based political organization has contributed more than $520,000 to back the ballot measure.
While proponents have spent just over $566,000, about $1.4 million has been spent to oppose it, as of Oct. 21. The Save Maine Absentee Voting ballot question committee reported another $370,000 in spending since then through more recent 24-hour expenditure reports. 
Question 2 
Question 2 on the ballot will ask voters if they would like to adopt a red flag law, which would allow family or household members to petition a court directly for someone’s firearms to be temporarily removed.
It will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
The majority of the fundraising for that proposal has been in support. The Safe Schools, Safe Communities ballot question committee raised more than $540,000 as of Oct. 21, compared to the roughly $94,000 raised by opponents. 
On Friday, the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, which opposes Question 2, said it is trying to raise an additional $10,000 to reach undecided voters after a recent poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center showed the opposition has a slight edge with voters. 
“We are out-funded and we are scrapping for every dollar,” the gun rights organization wrote in a campaign email sent out Friday.

When I asked what happened, she smiled apologetically and said she needed to feed her kids first. By the time they arrived, the painting activity—the part her kids were most excited about—was almost over.
As a mom, this scenario is too relatable. These are the kinds of things that happen all the time. For many families I work with, getting through the day takes careful juggling—figuring out meals, housing, transportation—all before they can even think about joining a event or program, even a free one. 
When basic needs aren’t met, it’s hard to focus on anything else.
I’ve worked in Connecticut’s nonprofit sector for more than two decades. I’ve seen trends come and go, programs shift, funding dry up and come back again. But this moment feels different. The ground feels a little less steady. With a federal shutdown threatening SNAP benefits and housing insecurity rising, families are being stretched to the limit. Nonprofits are being asked to do more than ever with less support, and it’s the same families—those already facing the hardest circumstances—who feel it first.
If SNAP pauses in November, we’re going to see it up close. Pantries will run low. Kids will head to school hungry. Parents will have a harder time concentrating at work or in training programs. And when that happens, even the best programs can fall short—not for lack of care or effort, but because survival always comes first.
Nonprofits have always been quick to fill the gaps when government systems fall short. But the truth is, we have limits too. We want our education, workforce, and youth programs to succeed—but none of that can happen if families are hungry or without a safe place to live. It’s a question we all need to keep asking: Are our participants fed? Are they safe? What’s really keeping them from showing up fully?
There are things we can do. Sometimes it’s as simple as providing snacks or meals during a workshop. Other times, it’s building new partnerships—with a local farm, a grocery store, or another organization—to make sure people have what they need. We can work together across housing, food, and education. It’s not glamorous work, but it’s real, it’s human, and it strengthens our missions—not distracts from them.
Funders, this is your moment too. A STEM program is important, but it won’t reach a child who’s hungry or sleeping in a car. The more flexibility you can offer in grants, the better equipped organizations will be to meet real, immediate needs. This isn’t extra—it’s essential.
The SNAP pause is just one example of something bigger. Food insecurity, unstable housing, and financial strain have been growing for years. Nonprofits are the pulse of our communities, and right now, that pulse is quickening. It’s on all of us to act—with creativity, urgency, and empathy—and to let the voices of those most impacted lead the way.
I keep thinking about that mom who showed up late. We took a few minutes to connect, offered some options, made room for her family. Later, she came back to volunteer. That small exchange stuck with me. Sometimes the most meaningful changes start in small, relatable moments—when we see someone’s reality and choose to respond.
The nonprofit sector is at a crossroads. We can keep doing business as usual, or we can start showing up differently—listening more closely, meeting people where they are, and leading with heart. How we show up now will shape more than our programs; it will shape the lives of the people we serve. And my hope is that we’ll choose wisely.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-28 04:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Teachers are key in the fight against domestic violence,Abbey Clements,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/teachers-are-key-in-the-fight-against-domestic-violence/,Having teachers and schools more routinely educated about Red Flag laws will help to keep our families safer.,"During Domestic Violence Awareness Month, very few people’s first thoughts are about teachers. They should be.
I spent more than 30 years in the classroom as a teacher and I saw how domestic violence intruded on the classroom in so many different ways. Around three-quarters of our nation’s K-12 teachers are women, and women are much more likely to experience domestic violence than men. According to the CDC, 41 percent of women have reported experiencing violence or stalking compared to 26 percent of men.
As a teacher, I especially think about the troubling link between domestic violence and gun violence. Nearly 70 percent of mass shootings involve a perpetrator with a history of domestic violence or family violence, according to a recent study.
Fortunately, we have more tools to intervene than ever before. Unfortunately, teachers are often left out of the loop. Connecticut was the first state in the nation to pass a “red flag” law. Signed into law in 1999, the law allowed law enforcement to seek a court order to remove guns and ammunition from the home of a person if there is cause to believe they pose an imminent risk of causing injury to themselves or others. Connecticut later modernized the law in 2021 to allow family members and medical professionals to also seek a court order.
Even after the law was modernized, as a teacher, I never received training about how these provisions, which are called “extreme risk protection orders,” work. That’s a significant gap that should be addressed. As teachers, we wear so many hats – not just educators, – we’re also unofficial clinicians and advisers. 
Much of teacher training involves our obligations to be mandatory reporters when a child faces abuse, neglect, or threats to their safety, training that is critical. But we should be going beyond that to make sure teachers are aware of extreme risk protection orders, which are now on the books in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Because too often, the public is not aware of these important tools.
A California survey found two-thirds of residents were unaware of the state’s Red Flag law, but 70 percent were supportive when they learned about the law’s provisions. In Connecticut, a study from this year found 79 percent of the state’s medical professionals were unaware of the state’s Red Flag law.
I’m not suggesting that teachers should be involved in having an extreme risk protection order issued. But we can be critical in helping to educate the community about these tools. When I think back to a mother who sat across from me in school who was visibly in crisis, or even a coworker who was struggling, I wish I had known about these provisions so that I could have been a better advocate for a struggling parent.
This work can go beyond educating teachers. Our teachers’ lounge could have had a fact sheet to share basic information about Connecticut’s Red Flag law, just like it had a poster with the usual labor law protections. And the information could be made available at parent-teacher conferences. 
As teachers, we often have some idea about what is happening in the home, especially when there is trouble. Having teachers and schools more routinely educate about Red Flag laws will not only make the public more aware of their options, but it can also help make these important tools seem less intimidating to people who are in crisis.
Red Flag laws are the first step. Now, we must make sure the public knows about them. Teachers are a natural answer.

(Stock.adobe.com photo by jonbilous)Two historically Black colleges and universities in Maryland received a total of $63 million in donations in a span of less than two weeks from billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the schools announced this month.
The unrestricted gifts — $63 million for Morgan State University announced on Oct. 15 and $38 million to University of Maryland, Eastern Shore announced Friday — are in addition to $60 million that Scott gave the schools five years ago. Morgan State got $40 million then, and UMES received $20 million.
Scott also donated $25 million in 2020 to Maryland’s second-largest HBCU, Bowie State University, the largest single gift in the school’s history. In total, Scott has donated $186 million to Maryland HBCUs in a nearly five-year period.
Officials at Morgan State and UMES said the latest donations are a vote of confidence in the progress they have been making. That was echoed Monday by Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, who said the gifts highlight the importance of HBCUs in the state, especially when the country is “seeing a movement” by the federal government to not support Black communities.
“Seeing these kinds of private investments really show us the importance and contributions of our HBCUs. I just feel proud and excited,” Wilkins said.
Scott was married to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for 25 years before they divorced in 2019. She currently has an estimated net worth of nearly $34 billion, according to Forbes. Besides being a philanthropist, Scott’s also an author of two novels.
On the same day Morgan State announced the second gift from Scott this month, she posted an essay on her website, Yield Giving.
“The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track,” Scott wrote. “Votes are not the only way to show what we’d like to see more of in our societies. There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.”
Scott or a representative could not be reached for comment Monday.

In a message to the UMES community Monday, President Heidi M. Anderson said the school will take suggestions – 100 words or less by Nov. 30 – on how to use the new $38 million gift.
“As we consider all input, we will do so through the lens of our strategic priorities – ensuring that every dollar advances UMES’s mission, supports our students, and builds a stronger future for generations to come,” Anderson wrote.
The letter notes that a “significant portion” would go toward strengthening the school’s endowment to generate future income.
Some other uses of the money for the school of nearly 3,000 students would go toward scholarships, academic research and creation of internships, apprenticeships and jobs in the Lower Eastern Shore.
David Balcom, vice president for university relations, said Monday the funding could also be used toward implementation of the school’s new school of veterinary medicine, which has about 100 students slated begin in fall 2027.
“It shows the confidence MacKenzie Scott and her team have put in UMES and Dr. Anderson,” Balcom said. “We’re still charting how best to use these funds, but literally hundreds of students will be supported by these funds over time.”
As for Morgan State, the state’s largest HBCU, the school said it plans to use the new $63 million donation to enhance its endowment, for student support, for academic research and initiatives to work with the city and state.
“To receive one historic gift from Ms. Scott was an incredible honor; to receive two speaks volumes about the confidence she and her team have in our institution’s stewardship, leadership, and trajectory,” Morgan State President David Wilson said in a statement announcing the donation. “This is more than philanthropy — it’s a partnership in progress.”
Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery), who received a master’s degree this year from Bowie State, said Scott’s investment shows confidence in the work of HBCUs.
“For far too long, HBCUs have been subjected to both historic underfunding, as well as duplication of programs,” he said. “I would like to applaud Scott for continuing to support our institutions with this most recent gift and her donations a few years back for BSU. It helps to educate the future generation of engineers, doctors, lawyers that our community, our state and our country needs.”

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/10/27/health-officials-launch-combined-data-dashboard-on-covid-other-respiratory-illnesses/,"Maryland health officials launched a data dashboard on seasonal respiratory illnesses that features data on the once-novel COVID-19 virus alongside flu and other seasonal infections, a sign of the progress made against COVID-19, experts say.","Vaccination data for COVID, RSV and the flu is featured on a new state dashboard reporting respiratory illnesses in Maryland. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Maryland health officials launched a new data dashboard on seasonal respiratory illnesses as the winter holidays approach — with data on the once-novel COVID-19 virus now reported alongside that of influenza and others.
The Maryland Department of Health announced Monday that the Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard aims to help families monitor seasonal illnesses that spike in the cooler months.
But public health researchers say the dashboard is also a sign of a new stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, where it operates as a “relatively equal threat” to the other viruses that circulate in the colder months. Deputy Secretary of Public Health Services Meg Sullivan agrees.
“We’re in a different place with COVID, and we know that COVID is endemic and happening,” Sullivan said Monday. “We want to really urge the public to know what is happening in the community, for all the respiratory viruses, to be able to make those informed decisions about how to best protect themselves and their families.”
Sullivan described the Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard as a “one-stop shop” for respiratory illnesses that Marylanders and health care providers should monitor in the coming months. The dashboard focuses on COVID-19, seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), among others.
The new Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard offers a wide variety of data for various viruses such as COVID-19 and the flu, such as vaccination uptake. (Chart courtesy of the Maryland Department of Health)
“The goal of the dashboard is to put the data all in one place,” Sullivan said. “To be able to have easy access to a snapshot of what is happening where they live, whether it’s the entire state or more specifically in their counties and how much disease is out there.”
The dashboard will be updated weekly to provide information on the respiratory illnesses. That includes information on the number of hospitalizations, along with deaths caused by those illnesses and the number of people getting vaccinated each week.
“Respiratory viruses continue to cause significant illness and death in the community each season,” the  health department said in a statement. “During the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season, nearly 5,000 Maryland residents were hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19, more than 8,000 with lab-confirmed flu, and more than 2,600 with lab-confirmed RSV.”
The Maryland Department of Health has hosted a public-facing dashboard on COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic back in 2020, at the time releasing daily updates on new cases, hospitalizations and deaths from the then-novel virus.
But as the pandemic evolved – and infection numbers were affected by the availability of new vaccines, growing herd immunity and other factors – the severity in the pandemic lessened, and state officials moved to weekly updates to the COVID-19 dashboard in May 2023. In addition, the development of at-home tests along with weakened disease tracking infrastructure in the later years of the pandemic reduced the accuracy of overall daily COVID-19 case data.
Officials say that the isolated COVID-19 dashboard will remain on the agency’s website, but Sullivan adds that the combined data dashboard will help families understand the full scope of respiratory viruses that could impact their communities.
“We would encourage people to use this dashboard to really see what is happening in the community with regards to respiratory viruses,” she said, noting that the dashboard also serves as a “reminder … that vaccines remain the most important way to protect yourselves and your community.”
Maryland health department moves away from daily COVID reports; what does that signal for the pandemic?

Andrew Pekosz, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor who researches COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, says that with new protections from COVID-19, the virus is now endemic and is a “relatively equal threat” to other seasonal illnesses.
“We’re now focusing on COVID as one of the respiratory viruses that we’re concerned with, side-by-side with influenza and RSV,” he said. “Now that we have population immunity, now that we have vaccines, now that we have treatments, it’s [COVID-19] fallen to that area of ‘here are the respiratory viruses that we need to follow.’”
He agreed that the state’s dashboard grouping COVID-19 data with other seasonal respiratory viruses marks progress against the pandemic.
“I think there is, from a general public’s perspective, an advantage to us talking about them as all being relatively equal threats to the population, because that shows you that we’ve gotten someplace with the COVID pandemic,” Pekosz said.
“We’re now treating it like we do these other viruses,” he said. “COVID-19 has now gotten to that area where it’s still a concern, but it’s an equal concern to other respiratory viruses that are circulating.”

“In Massachusetts, we have school districts who have yet to fully adopt a proven literacy curriculum, even though such approaches are the most effective ways to improve reading outcomes,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said Monday afternoon.
The bill (H 4642) seeks to tackle what officials describe as a literacy crisis, as more young students struggle with the foundational reading and writing skills needed for learning.
A little more than a third of districts in Massachusetts still use outdated reading instruction methods, said Education Committee Co-chair Rep. Ken Gordon. 
“MCAS scores among our youngest readers are falling,” he said. “Between 2011 and 2024, the average fourth grade reading scores fell by 11 percentage points. Among our most economically challenged districts, the decline has been greater.”
The Joint Committee on Education advanced the bill with bipartisan support this month, with 10 members voting in favor and none opposed.
The legislation would require districts to adopt literacy curricula backed by scientific research, focusing on kindergarten through third grade. It sets new standards for teacher training and educator preparation programs, and mandates regular evaluations of those programs by the commissioner of education, who would also publish annual performance data. 
K–3 students would be screened at least twice a year using approved literacy tools, with targeted intervention for students who fall below benchmarks tied to “age-typical development in specific literary skills.” The bill also launches a two-year paid teacher apprenticeship pilot in high-need districts and directs a statewide study on recruiting and retaining diverse, effective educators.
Curricula would need to include instruction in five research-based reading areas — phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
“These approaches are grounded in research and results, strategies that help all students learn to read and write wherever they live, regardless of their circumstances,” Mariano said.
Programs relying on “implicit or incidental instruction,” such as the three-cueing method — which involves visual memorization of whole words and guessing clues from context — would be prohibited.
If passed, Massachusetts would join a growing number of states reshaping early reading instruction around the “science of reading.” Supporters say it would align classroom practice with decades of cognitive science research on how children learn to read, emphasizing systematic phonics and structured literacy.
Critics — including the state’s largest teacher’s union, the Massachusetts Teachers Association — warn that statewide mandates could erode local control, add costly implementation burdens, and limit teachers’ flexibility to tailor lessons to students’ needs.
“This bill is not about telling the teachers how to do their job,” Mariano said. “As a former classroom teacher, I, too, would have resented that implication. Indeed, it’s about ensuring that teaching colleges equip future teachers with the tools they need to succeed — and that current teachers have access to high-quality, evidence-based materials to support their work in the classroom.”
Asked whether any funding would be offered to districts to help them transfer curriculums, Gordon pointed to the state’s existing program dubbed Literacy Launch. 
The $35 million grant program has already funded 58 districts to transition their curriculum to evidence-based literacy materials, he said. One of the conditions of accepting the grant funding is accepting evidence-based literacy teaching as defined by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
Gordon said no district that has applied for Literacy Launch so far has been denied because of funding, he believes funding will be sufficient for now, and they will reassess if necessary. 
Asked what they’ve heard on the bill from their counterparts in the Senate, Gordon replied, “We’re hopeful that they’re as interested in this issue as we are.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mariano-on-budget-scaled-e1712772238792.jpg?fit=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 22:17:04.145812

Sears/Maryland Matters)Local social services agencies have been directed by the secretary of the Maryland Department of Human Services to end the practice of housing foster care children in unlicensed facilities, including hotels.
The directive, issued in an Oct. 22 memo, orders all local departments of social services to immediately stop facilitating stays in unlicensed settings “for youth experiencing out-of-home” care. The announcement comes a month after the death of a 16-year-old girl who died of an apparent overdose while under state supervision in a Baltimore City hotel.
“We will not rest until every child in our state is safe, thriving in a permanent home, and surrounded by a loving family,” the department said in a statement. “We are committed to ending the use of inappropriate stays for all children in our care, and that goal is becoming a reality.”
As of Monday, there were 3,762 youth in out-of-home care in the state. Of those, six are in hotels, the department said in its statement.
The number is down from 41 reported on Jan. 31, 2023, according to the department.
The department ordered all six children to be relocated from those hotels by Nov. 24 and placed in kinship care, a licensed foster care facility or other regulated placements.
Department officials are scheduled to appear before the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee on Wednesday to answer questions about a scathing audit released last month.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

“Putting children in need, who require special attention or care and need love, support, and guidance in hotel rooms with minimal, if any, consistent adult supervision is an absurd policy,” House Minority Leader Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said in a statement. “It is blatantly wrong, and thankfully, DHS has finally reached this conclusion.
“It is unfortunately too late for children and families that have already suffered because of prior failures in our foster care system,” Buckel’s statement said. “Such a policy must never be allowed to be implemented again. Maryland’s foster children deserve better.”
That 70-page audit included findings that the department may have approved guardianship homes for children who are in state care where registered sex offenders lived and failed to identify a convicted sex offender who worked in a group foster home and later faced criminal charges involving children under his care.
Five days after the audit was released, the body of Kanaiyah Ward, 16, was found Sept. 22 in a room at a Residence Inn by Marriott. The teen had been living in the hotel on  N. Wolfe Street Baltimore.
An autopsy concluded that she died as the result of an overdose of diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter allergy medication.
“I am glad that DHS is ending this practice, but it still leaves many questions,” said Del. Mike Griffith (R-Harford and Cecil), who spent years in Maryland’s foster system as a child. “Where will these children be housed? As many of them are children like Kanaiyah who need mental health or medical services, will they be placed with treatment foster care providers? Or, as we already know happens, will they be placed in more dire environments like homeless shelters?
“Given this agency’s track record, it is important that we continue to push for the passage of Kanaiyah’s Law so we can be assured that these placements and practices are forever banned,” he said. Earlier this month, Griffith announced he would sponsor a bill — Kanaiyah’s Law — that would prohibit putting children who are in foster care into a hotel for more than a week without the review and approval of the secretary of Maryland’s Department of Social Services.
The bill — as described by Griffith — would also require training, licensing, and criminal background checks for one-on-one providers and give the state “legal authority to conduct ongoing monitoring, including background checks of adults residing with children placed in guardianship homes.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The cost of purchasing health insurance on Colorado’s individual marketplace is set to double next year in the absence of enhanced federal subsidies, state insurance officials announced Monday.
When the open-enrollment period for Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, begins on Nov. 1, the average consumer can expect a net premium increase of 101%, according to the figures released by the state’s Division of Insurance.
The vast majority of that “staggering” increase, the division said, is caused by the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, which congressional Republicans have declined to extend. The deadlock over whether to extend the subsidies, which help millions of people afford insurance, is the primary cause of the federal government shutdown that entered its 27th day on Monday.

“These premium increases are going to create impossible decisions for families across the state,” Colorado Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway said in a statement. “We have sounded the alarm bells at every turn, but Congress’ refusal to act means that Coloradans will be left with unacceptably high health insurance bills during a tightening time in the economy.”
Roughly 225,000 Coloradans purchase their health coverage from one of six insurers that offer plans on the individual marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act to serve consumers who are self-employed or otherwise don’t receive insurance from their employers. State insurance officials estimate that 75,000 of those enrollees are now set be priced out of coverage and become uninsured as of Jan. 1.
Subsidies for the purchase of marketplace health plans were included in the ACA, but legislation passed under President Joe Biden in 2021 expanded the number of households that were eligible for the subsidies. The enhanced eligibility allowed more than 3.2 million people to enroll in coverage who otherwise would not have, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
“For months, Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the Republican-forced health care crisis,” U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat and the ranking member on the House Health Subcommittee, said in a statement on Monday’s figures. “Costs are already too high under (President) Donald Trump, and many families will now be forced to choose between staying on their health care or buying groceries.”
In a poll conducted last month, the nonpartisan health organization KFF found that more than 78% of people, including 59% of Republicans, want lawmakers to keep the enhanced credits.
Consumer advocates have warned for months of large spikes in insurance premiums and other health costs in 2026, because of the combined impact of the tax credit expiration and broader cuts to Medicaid and other health programs included in Republicans’ tax and spending law.
“It’s clear why premiums are skyrocketing and why Coloradans will be shocked when they go shopping for insurance this open enrollment,” said Mannat Singh, executive director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, a nonprofit health advocacy organization. “Trump and Congressional Republicans have gutted healthcare coverage for families and small businesses that need it, so that they can fund tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations. This is what they set out to do, and all of Colorado’s GOP congresspeople voted for it.”
Congressional Republicans have said they are willing to negotiate with Democrats about the tax credits, but only after the government reopens.
Colorado lawmakers passed a bill during an August special legislative session that will partially offset the loss of the enhanced tax credits, including $100 million for the state’s health insurance affordability fund. Without that money, ACA marketplace premiums would have nearly tripled in 2026, the DOI estimated.
“I thank the Colorado legislature for what they have done so far to protect their constituents, and I urge Congress to step up and extend the enhanced premium tax credits,” Conway said. “Coloradans shouldn’t have to gamble their health simply because they cannot afford these rate increases caused by the federal government.”

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/briefs/comptroller-offers-deferral-of-tax-payment-plans-for-federal-workers/,"Federal workers who are on a state tax payment plan can ask to have their payments deferred during the ongoing federal government shutdown, the comptroller's office announced Monday.","A statue of longtime Comptroller Louis L. Goldstein stands outside the Goldstein Treasury Building in Annapolis. (Photo from grandbrothers/Shutterstock.com)Federal workers who are on a state taxe payment plan can ask to have their payments deferred during the ongoing federal government shutdown, the comptroller’s office announced Monday.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman announced the program as the shutdown entered its 27th day Monday, with no end in sight. The program would allow affected federal government workers to defer payments on their state tax plans for the duration of the shutdown.
“We recognize the financial strain this shutdown is placing on hardworking Marylanders, many of whom are working without a paycheck,” Lierman said in a statement announcing the deferral plan. “Our office is committed to doing everything we can to ease that burden and ensure families can stay afloat while the federal government remains at a standstill.”
Affected federal workers who have state tax payment plans can apply for a deferral by sending an email to GovShutdownRelief@marylandtaxes.gov. The email should include the taxpayer’s full name, address, the last four digits of their Social Security number and their case number or payment plan identification number.
Federal workers approved for the program will have their payment plans deferred for the duration of the shutdown, and for as many as 60 days after the government reopens before they needed to start paying again. The deferred tax payments plan is just the latest in a series of programs state agencies have offered in an effort to assist federal workers who are going without pay.
The government shut down Oct. 1 when the Senate could not agree on a proposal to keep government operations funded through the first months of fiscal 2026, sending most government workers home without pay and requiring essential employees to keep working without pay.
The shutdown is already the second-longest on record, and will tie the record of 35 days — set in President Donald Trump’s first term — in just over a week. At this point, a resolution appears unlikely any time soon: Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have refused to budge off their positions, President Trump is overseas and House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to bring the House back from a recess that started five weeks ago until there is a budget in place.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)John Boyle, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, abruptly resigned his position on Friday. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced the appointment of his deputy, John Crowther, as acting head of the agency that regulates Alaska’s agriculture, mining, oil and gas.
The governor’s office declined Monday to answer questions about the resignation, which had not been previously announced.
Dunleavy is term-limited and will leave office in December 2026. Boyle’s departure follows those of Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum and Attorney General Treg Taylor.
The resignations of both of those men — who are now Republican candidates for governor in next year’s elections — were announced in advance, unlike Boyle’s departure.
Boyle could not be reached for comment on Monday.
The departing commissioner has extensive experience in the oil industry. Before joining Dunleavy’s cabinet in 2023, he was a lobbyist for BP and Oil Search.
Crowther, who will replace Boyle on an interim basis, has been with the Department of Natural Resources since 2012, the governor’s office said.
He previously worked as director of the governor’s Washington, D.C. office and served on the staff of the U.S. Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He holds a law degree from Georgetown University.
“The Department of Natural Resources is at the forefront of protecting and developing Alaska’s precious land and waters. Mr. Crowther’s legal background and experience as a deputy commissioner make him a great choice to advance the responsible development, and maximum use, of Alaska’s natural resources consistent with the public interest as mandated by Alaska’s Constitution,” the governor said in a prepared statement released on Friday.

Fourth District Judge Tony Graf called media and public attention to the case “extraordinary.” He did not rule on a request from Tyler Robinson’s attorneys to restrict news coverage of the case, saying it required “further briefing.”
The case has drawn intense national attention after Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. A family friend persuaded Robinson to turn himself in, ending a 33-hour manhunt, authorities said.

Robinson’s defense attorneys argue the publicity could harm his right to a fair trial. 
“The court should limit media coverage, or video and photographic coverage, at the least, so the defendant’s appearance is no longer the subject of interest and he has some chance of securing a fair and impartial jury,” his legal team wrote in court papers filed last week. 
They said the media’s right of access to criminal cases “is not absolute” and can be restricted altogether to ensure a fair trial. 
Robinson has been charged with multiple crimes, including one count of aggravated murder, which is a capital offense in Utah. Prosecutors have announced they intend to seek the death penalty if Robinson is convicted.
First Amendment attorney Jeff Hunt told Utah News Dispatch that banning cameras from courtrooms altogether isn’t necessary. He noted that in Utah statute, there’s a presumption they’re allowed. 
“The law sets a high bar to kick cameras and the public out of the courtroom, and for good reason,” Hunt said. “Electronic media coverage allows the public to actually see and hear what transpires in the courtroom, and have a fuller and more meaningful understanding of the proceedings.”  
Charges filed against Utah man accused of killing Charlie Kirk; prosecutors will seek death penalty

Courts have a range of tools they can use to protect the right to a fair trial, he said, including carefully vetting prospective jurors about the news they’ve read or watched on a case and widening a jury pool. 
On Monday, the judge said the restrictions he ordered on photography strike “the proper balance between Mr. Robinson’s right to a fair proceeding and the public’s right to access and transparency.” 
The judge also prohibited news cameras from showing him standing, coming in or leaving the courtroom. Graf said Robinson must wear physical restraints in court — the least restrictive ones necessary for safety — but can wear civilian clothes in court instead of a jail uniform.
Robinson’s attorneys had argued that prospective jurors seeing him in shackles and jail clothes would perceive him as “guilty and deserving of death.” 
Monday’s virtual court proceedings followed a Friday hearing that was closed to the press and public.  
Robinson appeared from the Utah County Jail with the camera off and spoke only when the judge asked if he could hear. 
“Yes I can,” Robinson replied. 
He returns to court for an in-person hearing on Jan. 16.

(Getty Images)The political fallout from the ongoing federal government shutdown continued Monday in Georgia, as Democrats pushed to protect America’s largest food assistance program while Republicans deflected blame onto Democrats in Washington.
Georgia SNAP seeks at least $60 million after federal budget cuts

The latest clash stemming from the federal shutdown centers on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. The SNAP program is set to run out of funds on Nov. 1, meaning that as many as 1.4 million Georgians who rely on the aid could face the abrupt loss of benefits starting this weekend. Though the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, currently has about $6 billion in a contingency fund, the department has said it will not use the money to help fund the program during the shutdown.
State Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat who chairs the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, urged Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to help fund the program during a Monday press conference at the state Capitol in Atlanta.

“This shutdown threatens to push vulnerable families even closer to the edge,” Merritt said. “As state leaders, we cannot stand idly by while Georgians endure the ripple effects of political inaction in Washington.”
State Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, led a separate effort and sent a letter to Kemp requesting he declare a state of emergency in response to what she called the “ongoing Trump shutdown.” Parkes urged Kemp to use the state’s $14.6 billion surplus to provide temporary relief. She said that her constituents have already reached out with concerns about how they will feed their families if they lose SNAP benefits next month.
“Food is not optional and we have a moral obligation to see to it that Georgia families do not go hungry,” Parkes said in a statement.
Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock joined a coalition of Democratic senators in Washington to press the Trump administration to “sustain” the food assistance program. In a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Democratic senators said they were alarmed that the USDA had instructed states to stop processing November benefits, claiming the agency has “several tools available” to avert a lapse in grocery assistance for American families.
The senators called on the agency to utilize the USDA’s “existing authority,” including its contingency funding and interchange authority, which Democratic senators said allows the transfer of funds from other USDA nutrition programs to SNAP, to ensure benefits continue through November.
But Kemp blamed the impasse on the Democratic leadership in Congress just moments after the Department of Human Services announced Friday it would not administer SNAP benefits in November. He called on Senate Democrats to pass the continuing resolution Republicans passed out of the House, arguing it was “past time … to get back to working for the people of our state.”
“As the impacts of the Schumer shutdown are becoming clearer for Georgians, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock still refuse to do their jobs and open the government,” Kemp said in a statement Friday. The political stalemate leaves over one million Georgians, including 640,000 children, at risk of hunger. Kemp’s office has not returned a request for comment or publicly indicated whether the governor intends to declare a state of emergency or allocate state funds for the federal program.
Federal food aid for over one million Georgians to stop Nov. 1 because of shutdown

However, coming up with funding for the program is only part of the problem, since the infrastructure used to issue SNAP funding to residents is controlled by the federal government. Some states, including North Dakota, have been unable to load state funding onto participants’ electronic payment cards, according to state officials.
The Georgia Department of Human Services, which helps disperse federal SNAP funds to Georgia residents, did not respond to an email inquiry about Georgia’s SNAP infrastructure.
Nov. 1 also marks the first day of open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, a program whose rising costs are at the center of the shutdown as federal enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of this year. If Congress does not extend the credits, Americans could see their monthly insurance premiums more than double on average, according to the nonpartisan health organization KFF. Congressional Democrats have said they will not support a GOP path to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to negotiate on rising health care costs.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State Superintendent Ellen Weaver will ask the Legislature for another $5 million to expand eligibility for performance-based bonuses after 400 teachers received a pay boost for the program’s inaugural year, she said Monday.
The state Department of Education doled out just half of what legislators approved last year for the pilot program: At least one teacher at each of the 37 participating schools received some amount, totaling $2.5 million in bonuses, according to agency.
The state-paid bonuses averaged $6,300. The highest award was $33,500.
The other $2.5 million will roll over into this school year, said department spokesman Jason Raven.
That will give the agency $7.5 million total to award for year two of the pilot. More schools will be participating this school year, though it’s unclear how many. The agency has not yet released specifics.
It’s also unclear why half of last year’s allotment went unspent. Weaver did not address that at a news conference Monday celebrating the awards.
The bonus program is meant to reward teachers for a job well done in an effort to keep the state’s best teachers in their classrooms and encourage student growth, Weaver said.
“The goal of this is to thank our teachers, to support them for the great work that they do, and then to keep them in the classroom,” she said. “We want our very best teachers in the areas where we need them most.”
500 SC teachers got bonuses of up to $57K. Program leaders want to expand them statewide.

Different models
The program expands on a public-private model started at Meeting Street Schools in Charleston County in 2021 and run by Beemok Education, a nonprofit funded by philanthropist Ben Navarro.
Its model compares students’ performance on tests at the beginning and end of the school year to judge their progress.
Schools in the state pilot had the option of having their bonus program overseen by Beemok (but funded by the state). Eleven of the 37 participating schools went with Beemok. Of the 400 teachers receiving a state-funded bonus, 94 were part of Beemok’s announcement earlier this month. Their bonuses averaged $9,135, according to the Department of Education.
Roughly half of the 37 schools based bonuses on students’ performance on end-of-year state-standardized math and reading tests taken by students in third through eighth grades. The average bonus for those teachers was $8,728, according to the agency.
Six schools created their own model to measure academic growth, which included using scores on end-of-course tests taken by high schoolers. Bonuses in those schools averaged $3,315.
In all, more than 800 teachers statewide received a combined $6 million in bonuses, according to numbers provided by Beemok Education and the Department of Education.

Funding request
Weaver is seeking an additional $5 million for bonuses at the end of the 2026-27 school year. That would give her agency three years of data to help craft a potential statewide expansion, Weaver said.
She’s long been a proponent of rewarding teachers for proven performance. Her first budget request in 2023 included a $25 million ask for a bonus program, which the Legislature didn’t fund.
Weaver also plans to continue pushing for higher salaries for all teachers, she said.
Since the 2020 pandemic, the state-required minimum salary for a first-year teacher has risen from $35,000 to $48,500.
Repeating a request from last year, Weaver is again asking legislators to raise the floor to $50,000. The bonuses are meant to supplement state minimums in the so-called salary schedule, which pays teachers based on their years in the classroom and level of college degree, Weaver said.
Rewarding teachers for students’ documented progress “is a really important way for us to incentivize our very strongest teachers into our classrooms where we need them the most,” Weaver said.
Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association, said he would be open to seeing some sort of boost for excellent teachers, but he worried about whether a statewide model could be fair to all teachers, including those whose classes didn’t include testing. He suggested teacher evaluations as a more equitable way of distributing bonuses, though even those would need a standardized process first, he told the SC Daily Gazette previously.
Highest performer
At Seven Oaks Elementary Global Magnet in Columbia, 20 teachers — 86% of those eligible — earned awards. That’s the highest proportion of any school participating in the state-funded pilot, according to the Department of Education.
Those teachers earned a total of $141,500, which Weaver presented to the school’s principal in the form of a giant check Monday.

Seven Oaks, part of Lexington-Richland School District Five, exemplifies the program’s goals, Weaver said. A school where more than 85% of its students live in poverty showed more growth than any other, she said.
That shows the dedication of students and staff alike, said Principal Angie Slatton.
“I often say that these children and staff are easy to work hard for,” she said. “They inspire us every single day and truly deserve to be celebrated.”
While Seven Oaks is a magnet school — a public form of school choice — there are no academic requirements for attending. Students outside the normal attendance zone are selected by lottery. The students and staff represent more than 25 nationalities, according to the school’s website.
Jennifer Clyburn, an award winner who teaches first grade, works to tailor her lessons to the specific students in her classes each year instead of sticking to a set lesson plan year after year, she said. She focuses on how her students’ mistakes can help them learn and encourages them to remember there are no bad questions, she said.
Clyburn didn’t say how big of a bonus she received.

Charlie Copeland detailed a plan from government expansion to private-sector growth
 
WILMINGTON, Del. — Oct. 27, 2025 — Charlie Copeland, the Senior Director on economic, tax and fiscal policy at the Caesar Rodney Institute and one of Delaware’s leading voices on the economy, outlined a pro-growth plan Monday aimed at jump-starting private-sector investment and widening the state’s tax base.
He appeared on the popular live podcast “A Better Discussion,” hosted by Jane Brady, chair of  “A Better Delaware”, at 8 a.m. Monday, Oct. 27, where he detailed a pivot from government expansion to private-sector growth. His plan centers on cutting red tape, rethinking taxes that he says punish small firms, lowering energy costs by rebuilding in-state generation, and strengthening the workforce pipeline through better K–12 results.
“We need leaders with a growth mindset,” Copeland said. “Set my people free… every week, I want a list of 200 regulations we’re going to get rid of.”
Taxes that “hit before profits”
Copeland said Delaware’s corporate income tax is the highest in the nation for operators and that the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) functions as a hidden sales tax that businesses owe “whether your business is making money or not.”
“It’s wrong to say that Delaware has no sales tax. Delaware has a sales tax,” he said, describing how the levy “pyramids” through the supply chain—farmer, processor, retailer—before goods reach consumers. That structure, he added, drains cash during downturns and slows hiring and investment.
Brady noted residents also feel an everyday bite from tolls and utility and telecom fees, and flagged new annual road-use fees—$120 for electric vehicles and $60 for hybrids—meant to offset declining gas-tax revenue.
Cut regulation, speed permitting
Beyond taxes, Copeland said dense codes and slow permitting chill construction and business expansion. He called for an executive-led rollback modeled on “two-for-one” deregulation—eliminate multiple rules for every new one—and weekly progress checks on permits for housing and job-creating projects.
“Instead of a pro-growth mindset… we have a pro-bureaucracy, pro-regulatory environment,” he said. “Leadership matters.”
Compete on energy again
Pointing to rising electricity prices, Copeland said Delaware went from producing most of its power in-state to importing more, with line losses and higher costs. He criticized past subsidies for Bloom Energy—“$750 million… for nothing”—and urged serious consideration of nuclear and emerging hydrogen technologies to anchor reliable, lower-cost energy for employers.
Keep young founders in Delaware
Copeland tied weak new-business formation to out-migration of young adults, arguing that “we do not have a growth mindset” that gives entrepreneurs speed, cost certainty and talent. He and Brady linked long-term prosperity to improving K–12 results so employers can find the workforce they need in-state.
“There is nothing that is free,” Copeland said of expansive programs. “It is only subsidized”—which, he argued, ultimately falls on families and businesses when growth stalls.
Copeland’s pro-growth pillars (as presented)


Tax modernization: Reduce or restructure the GRT to end pyramiding and stop taxing firms before profit; signal a competitive corporate-tax posture for operators, not just incorporations.


Regulatory reset: Executive-branch mandate to cull outdated rules weekly; fast-track permits for housing and job-creating projects; agency accountability for delays.


Energy competitiveness: Rebuild in-state generation; evaluate nuclear and hydrogen; avoid subsidy deals that raise ratepayer costs without delivering jobs.

SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, helps feed about 1.4 million North Carolinians each month. The federal government shutdown means benefits for November are suspended. 
On Monday, the state Department of Health and Human Services warned people who use SNAP that their next round of monthly benefits won’t arrive on schedule. 
More than 580,000 children rely on SNAP, NCDHHS said in a news release, and more than 80% of people who receive food benefits are working. 
Food banks are doing what they can, though their directors know there’s no way they can fill the gap. 
For every nine meals provided through SNAP, food banks provide one, said Liz Reasoner, CEO of Food Bank of the Albemarle. 
“We’re trying to approach this from a disaster mitigation strategy,” she said. 
The state’s food banks, which supply food pantries and other distributors, were already feeling a financial pinch. A federal program that helped food banks nationwide purchase locally grown food was cancelled this year. The state legislature had routinely appropriated money to food banks, but did not include them in this year’s stopgap budgets. 
The Food Bank of the Albemarle decided to pay for seeds and labor for a local farm to grow vegetables, Reasoner said. “One way we can mitigate some of the loss is by investing in intentional planting programs.” 
The government shutdown was putting pressure on nonprofits before the SNAP suspension. A food pantry in Elizabeth City saw a 50% increase in traffic last Saturday, which Reasoner attributed to paychecks lost through the government shutdown. 
“We knew it was going to happen,” she said, as households adjusted their budgets to account for limited cash. 
Federal benefits that help pay for baby formula set to run out
N.C. Rep. Monika Johnson-Hostler spent part of Monday calling people about providing formula to babies who will lose access to it when funding for the federal nutrition program focused on infants, young children and their mothers runs out. 
With the attention on SNAP, Johnson-Hostler (D-Wake) worried that people won’t know that federal support for parents buying baby formula is also at risk. 
“That’s what’s scary to me,” she said. “I don’t think people knew it was happening.” 
Money for the federal nutrition program Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, won’t end as soon as SNAP does, but won’t last too much longer than the larger program. 
NCDHHS said in an email that benefits will last until early November, but did not give an exact end date. 
Wake County said in an email that WIC will issue benefits through Nov. 15. 
More than 262,000 babies, pregnant women, new mothers, and young children in North Carolina use WIC, according to NCDHHS.
Wake County is advising mothers who are supplementing breast milk with formula to increase breastfeeding to help boost milk supply. 
Pediatricians may be a short-term source of formula, Wake’s email said. In special cases, WIC will coordinate with hospitals or manufacturers to arrange for direct deliveries, the email said. 
Political finger-pointing
In a statement Monday, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein urged the USDA to use federal contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits available after Nov. 1. The USDA said last week it would not use contingency fund to help cover the cost, the New York Times reported. 
“The administration’s refusal to use these available funds as temperatures cool and the Thanksgiving holiday approaches is a cruel abdication of the responsibility to support families and communities,” Stein’s statement said.
Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration continue to blame Democrats for the shutdown that threatens to suspend food benefits in days. 
Most Democrats have voted against a short-term budget in an effort to pressure Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act marketplace tax credits for health care coverage.

On a party-line vote, Democrats approved a procedural resolution expanding the session’s scope to include a proposed constitutional amendment on redistricting, a move Republicans denounced as unconstitutional and politically motivated just one week before the Nov. 4 election. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)With just one week before Election Day, Virginia lawmakers returned to the state Capitol Monday for a surprise special session that swiftly turned into a partisan clash over the future of the state’s congressional map — and, potentially, its balance of political power for years to come.
House Democrats, using procedural maneuvers that caught Republicans off guard, pushed through a procedural resolution crafted by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, which, if successful, would allow the General Assembly to consider a proposed constitutional amendment granting lawmakers authority to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts mid-decade. 
Under the resolution, adopted on a party-line vote in both chambers, lawmakers may now consider budget and revenue bills, judicial appointments and constitutional amendments related to redistricting and reapportionment. The measure effectively removes the usual constraints that limit special sessions to subjects designated by the governor or legislative leaders.
“This was an important vote for us to take this week in order for us to have that option,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee. “If we were not to take this action right now, then we would be pulling an option from the voters.”
Republicans decried the legislative action as an ambush carried out largely behind closed doors. Democrats argued the procedural expansion is needed to respond to what they view as a growing national campaign by Republicans — encouraged by President Donald Trump — to reengineer congressional maps mid-decade. 
As first reported by The New York Times last week, Democratic strategists, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, have urged Virginia to act preemptively in case federal courts uphold new Republican-drawn maps in states such as Texas, North Carolina and Missouri that could tilt the balance of the U.S. House.
“The actions that Texas and Missouri and North Carolina have taken have triggered this,” Price said. “The trigger has already been pulled when it comes to attacks on our democracy. So that’s why Virginia is here. We are going to do our job to protect democracy in Virginia.”
 Republicans cry foul

Republicans blasted the maneuver as a constitutional overreach designed to change election rules days before voters decide three statewide races. 
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said Democrats had sidelined the minority and the public in an opaque process that left many guessing what was actually being planned.
“There’s a lot of issues that we need to talk about to the voters of Virginia, but obviously the ruling party had other plans,” Kilgore told reporters on the House floor. “Just let it be known that we do think that this was a plan to take us out of having any motions of personal privilege. … I just want to know from our side, because we’re not privy to all this, are we going to have a redistricting constitutional amendment coming to the floor?”

Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, accused Democrats of hiding the ball: “You know a bill is a bad idea when a member mumbles through their description of it and refuses to take questions and sits back down,” O’Quinn said. “They don’t want morning hour speeches, so you’re getting to see a really bad idea play out in real time.”
Republicans also questioned whether Democrats had already missed the legal window to advance a constitutional amendment this year. 
Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, cited Virginia Code § 30-13, which requires proposed constitutional amendments to be posted publicly at least three months before the next House of Delegates election.
“That deadline has already passed,” Orrock said on the House floor, arguing that any amendment passed this week could not legally appear before voters in November.
Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, warned that Democrats were defying centuries of precedent. 
“Here we are, eight days before Election Day, near the conclusion of our 46-day election season, in Richmond,” Ware said. “The purpose of this unprecedented special session during an election is to hitch Virginia, belatedly, to the pell-mell bandwagon, to redistrict, or to speak more honestly, to gerrymander, the commonwealth’s electoral districts.”
 Democrats: Amendment only creates an “option”

Price and other Democrats maintained that the move does not dismantle Virginia’s independent redistricting commission, approved by voters in 2020, but merely creates an additional safeguard should courts or federal actions reshape national political boundaries.
Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who will carry the proposed constitutional amendment, said the plan “is going to give us options.”
“Maybe the most important point to make here is what the resolution is not going to do, which is to abolish the commission that was created through the earlier constitutional amendment,” Willett said. 
“This is to create, again, not a mandate, but an option, in the interim, in between those decennial redistrictings to do something when there’s an extraordinary circumstance.”
He added that the move was necessary because “our hand’s been forced here. This is not our choice to be here, but with this kind of attack, we’ve got to respond.”
Democratic House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who last week called lawmakers back to Richmond, declined to outline his full plan publicly. But some Democratic leaders told Virginia Scope last week that the goal is to prevent Virginia’s representation in Congress from being weakened if neighboring states redraw their maps to favor Republicans.
 Earle-Sears, GOP candidates seize on the optics

Before the session opened, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — who presided over the state Senate Monday and is also the Republican nominee for governor — staged a campaign-style news conference on the Capitol steps, accusing Democrats of abusing their majority for partisan gain.
“Today, Democrats in our General Assembly are calling this special session, not to serve the people, but to serve ourselves,” Earle-Sears said. “They want to dismantle the very independent redistricting commission that Virginia was voting for in a bipartisan majority.”
Earle-Sears called the commission “born out of a prayer, a rare moment of unity, when Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that voters … should choose their own representatives, and not the other way around.”

 She linked the move directly to her Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, saying, “This pressure is coming from Washington insiders and Abigail Spanberger. What we are seeing today is the worst kind of political backtracking, an attempt to grab power by erasing the voter’s voice.”
Her remarks came as national attention turned to a $150,000 donation each from Holder’s National Democratic Redistricting Committee to Spanberger’s campaign and to Virginia House Democrats. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin seized on that timing Monday, accusing Spanberger of hypocrisy.
“This was Abigail Spanberger’s position just a few short years ago,” Youngkin wrote on X, citing her 2019 praise of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down racially gerrymandered districts. “All it took was $150,000 from the ‘Democrat Redistricting Committee’ to change her position completely,” Youngkin wrote.
Spanberger has not commented publicly on the current effort. In an August interview with WJLA, she said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid on Monday echoed Earle-Sears’ criticism, saying Democrats were “not respecting the will of the people.”
“They made it very clear, just five years ago, they don’t want petty partisanship,” Reid said. “They don’t want politicians drawing their own lines … this is not respectful to the people in Virginia.”
 GOP congressional delegation joins chorus

Earlier in the day, Virginia’s five Republican members of Congress — U.S. Reps. Morgan Griffith, Jen Kiggans, Rob Wittman, Ben Cline and John McGuire — held a joint news conference at the Capitol condemning the Democratic move.
Griffith, a former House majority leader in the state legislature, said he had firsthand experience with partisan line-drawing. 
“I was a part of partisan redistricting, but the voters of Virginia spoke in 2020 that they didn’t like that happening,” he said. Griffith argued that a special session after early voting had already begun “deprives those who have voted early” of the chance to weigh the issue.

Kiggans, who represents a competitive swing district in Hampton Roads, called the proposal a cynical replay of Washington dysfunction. “It’s a competitive district, and always will be,” she said, likening the Democratic plan to “partisan games in Washington” that have “now trickled down here to Richmond.” 
 Legal doubts and political fallout

Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, told The Mercury in an interview Monday that the Democratic proposal was “unconstitutional.”
“There is no intervening election,” Peake said. “Nine-hundred thousand people have already voted. They’re supposed to post it in courthouses for three months before the election. They don’t have a bill, they don’t have a constitutional amendment. It’s not going through. As I said, it’s a ruse.”
Peake predicted “this will 100 percent end up in court.” 
He dismissed comparisons to Trump’s mid-decade redistricting push in Texas. 
“Where we are different is, we have a constitutional amendment in place that says how we do redistricting. Not mid-decade, it’s every decade. And it’s bipartisan.”
 Broader stakes: A national redistricting arms race

The New York Times reported last week that Virginia Democrats’ rush to act stems from a fear that Republican-controlled states could redraw congressional boundaries before 2026, potentially costing Democrats several seats. 
Trump’s public calls for GOP legislatures to redistrict mid-decade have prompted a flurry of legal and legislative action in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina. The U.S. Supreme Court is also currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana.
In that context, Democrats in Virginia — one of only a few southern states with divided political control in recent years — see a constitutional amendment as both a defensive measure and a statement of principle.
But even some Democrats privately concede that the optics of returning to Richmond just days before an election could prove risky, particularly as Republicans work to cast the move as proof of overreach.
 Next steps and uncertain path ahead

Price, whose committee oversees election law, said the Privileges and Elections Committee would meet Wednesday morning to review the amendment text, followed by a potential vote in the full House later this week. 
She emphasized that the amendment would require approval again in the next legislative session and voter ratification in a statewide referendum before taking effect.
“I’ve been here for 10 years,” Price said. “We’ve had several proposed constitutional amendments, and when the Republicans were in charge, they weren’t worried about what they were bringing up. We are fully within our right to be here.”
Still, the legal and political obstacles are formidable. 
Virginia law requires constitutional amendments to be approved by two separately elected General Assemblies, meaning even if Democrats pass it this week, it would need to survive another vote after the new legislature convenes in January — and then win approval at the ballot box in 2026.
Republicans appear determined to challenge the process in court before it gets that far. “They’re wasting our time,” Peake, the RPV chair, said flatly. “It’s going to be overturned as soon as it gets to court.”
As night fell on the Capitol, lawmakers filtered out of the chamber with few clear answers and even fewer signs of bipartisan consensus. 
Price, standing outside the chamber doors, said Democrats would proceed carefully but deliberately.
“It’s important that we have all of our options on the table,” she said again. “This is about protecting democracy in Virginia.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).Louisiana’s largest provider of aid for sexual assault survivors cut back on services this month as a result of not receiving funding before the federal government shutdown. 
Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response, or STAR, had to halt its hospital accompaniment program, where staff members support victims going through an evidence-gathering medical exam after a sexual assault. 

STAR serves sexual assault survivors in 15 parishes in central and southeast Louisiana. The organization’s hospital accompaniment services will stop for the foreseeable future in St. Tammany Parish and the New Orleans area, where other nonprofits also provide that service. 

In Baton Rouge and Alexandria, STAR hopes to be able to resume hospital accompaniment in November after not offering it in October. But the organization will have to cut back on other services to do so, said Morgan Lamandre, its CEO. In those regions, STAR is the only entity to send staff into hospitals. 
To pay for hospital accompaniment in Baton Rouge and Alexandria, Lamandre will have to shut down STAR’s case management program. It gives sexual assault survivors help accessing crime victims’ funding, health care and other assistance in the weeks and months after their assault. Those processes can be bureaucratic and confusing for those not used to navigating them, which is why STAR offers that support to their clients.
But Lamandre said the organization has to prioritize its hospital accompaniment program in Baton Rouge and Alexandria because the nonprofit needs to offer the service in order to keep its accreditation and some other funding. 

STAR and other Louisiana organizations that help sexual assault survivors have found themselves in a difficult financial position because much of their funding has been cut off while the federal government is shuttered.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

During previous D.C. shutdowns, federal assistance for crime victims continued to flow. But the Trump administration has  shuttered the federal crime victim offices this time, Louisiana Foundation Against Sexual Assault executive director Rafael de Castro said in an interview earlier this month.

In the case of STAR, the organization was awarded a $700,000 federal grant it can’t access because the federal staff who administer it are not working. The nonprofit had also expected to hear at the beginning of October about whether it had won a $1.2 million grant it typically receives every year. But with the government closed, a notice about the award hasn’t been sent yet.

“We could have the grant, but we don’t know if we have the grant. We need to assume we are not getting the grant,” Lamandre said. 

The shutdown resulted from an impasse in Congress over the extent to which the federal government should subsidize health care coverage for people who purchase their insurance through a government exchange. Democrats want a vote assuring tax credits to make those health plans more affordable will continue. Republicans believe the debate over the cost of the health care plans should be dealt with separately. 
In the meantime, more than a million federal employees are not getting paid, and scores of federally funded services are not being provided. 
Louisiana lawmakers announced last week they plan to use $150 million monthly to help pay for residents’ groceries while a federal food assistance program isn’t operating. 
Lamandre and de Castro said they intend to ask for $2 million in permanent state funding for sexual assault survivor centers to be added to the Louisiana budget next year. Over half of STAR’s budget currently comes from federal grants, but Lamandre fears Washington, D.C., will no longer provide financial stability for her organization and others. 

Louisiana also provides very little of its own funding for sexual assault survivor support and programs. This year, the state’s domestic violence shelters and child advocacy centers, which serve children who are victims of abuse, received $7 million and $1.2 million in general state revenue, respectively. Sexual assault survivor centers received no comparable allocation. 
“There are no state dollars provided to stand-alone sexual assault centers like STAR,” Lamandre said. 

Louisiana uses unclaimed gambling winnings each year to pay hospitals, nurses and other medical providers for performing forensic medical exams, during which physical evidence of a sexual crime can be collected. That fund has about $6.2 million currently, but it doesn’t pay for counseling, legal assistance or the other support sexual assault survivor centers provide, according to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement.
A new law, sponsored by state Rep. Kellee Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, was crafted with the intention of creating a new source of funding for sexual assault, child abuse and domestic violence victim service providers. But Lamandre has doubts that it will become a reliable source of money. 

The law assesses a new $2,000 fine on people convicted of crimes related to sexual assault, human trafficking and domestic violence. In theory, it could produce over $1 million per year based on the approximately 500 convictions these offenses produce annually, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.  
But people imprisoned for such crimes often don’t have the means to pay criminal fines after they become incarcerated. Prison jobs pay as little as less than a dollar per hour, and incarcerated people have other financial obligations – such as child support and victim reparations – they are also required to cover, according to previous reports on Louisiana’s criminal justice system. 

A financial analysis of the new law also notes that the $1 million might be difficult to collect on time, explaining that “current law provides that indigent offenders may be placed on a payment plan and therefore the $2,000 may be dispersed across multiple fiscal years.”
“The likeliness we will see any meaningful funding from that bill is not so high,” Lamandre said at a legislative hearing last month on child sexual abuse.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_2604-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

The renovation of the Latino Center of the Midlands along a historic commercial corridor was kickstarted by a $2.8 million award from the State of Nebraska’s North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program.

Anticipated completion in early 2027 will take the center from about 17,000 square feet to nearly 29,000 square feet, officials said. Walls will fall between the longtime headquarters and an adjacent bank building the nonprofit bought last year. Additional space will be created, including outward extension of the top floor and a new deck area.
All services, including workforce development programming that had been offered in a leased spot a block away, will be under one roof  — with space carved out for such features as a training kitchen envisioned as a hub for pop-up restaurants and community events.
“We will be able to serve more people more completely because we have more space,” said CEO and president Albert Varas. 
A groundbreaking reception is scheduled Tuesday. 
Rooted in Chicano movement
Philanthropic and private donor funds complement the state grant in covering the $10 million for the capital project at 4821 S. 24th St. Fundraising efforts for future operating funds are ongoing, Varas said.
The Latino center expansion was part of a bundle of South Omaha projects submitted in an application led by nonprofit Canopy South, which is acting as a sort of “community quarterback.” The resulting $64 million award from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development is divided among seven entities, including the Latino center. 	

Construction activity picks up
The funding source for the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program started with deadline-strapped COVID-19 federal dollars, but a swap with state dollars later occurred to allow more time for a complex slate of projects to develop. Sharing the funds are about 130 groups and businesses, whose selection by state officials were based on potential for helping to reverse disinvestment. The dollars are to be spent by the end of 2027 — a deadline that has prompted a flurry of recent groundbreakings.



César García, executive director of Canopy South, called the Latino center’s extensive renovation “a transformative investment” in South Omaha — opening more pathways to health, education and opportunity.”
Described as the largest Latino-serving agency in Nebraska’s most populous city, the center was born as the Chicano Awareness Center. Its roots go back to the 1960s when the local Mexican-American community and youths were tuned in to the Chicano civil rights movement in larger places such as California, and feeling effects of discrimination in their own city. 
Local leaders began meeting with the goal of creating a self-esteem-building and advocacy hub where young people could affirm their heritage and gain leadership skills.
The Chicano Awareness Center launched formally in 1971 and in 1974 moved into the space on the 24th Street corridor. The range of services and bilingual advocacy efforts grew — to art and culture, anti-gang and anti-drug programming, educational and student support, English language learner classes, civic engagement, family well-being, summer internships and workforce development. 
In 2007, the nonprofit changed its name to Latino Center of the Midlands to better reflect the growing and broader population from various Spanish-speaking countries. The center’s staff has grown to 36 people.
Coffees, community conversations
The renovated headquarters will feature youth-centric areas and modern classrooms to enhance GED, citizenship and literacy programs. A new teaching kitchen will promote nutrition education and is expected to be a “social enterprise” space to host coffee conversations and guest speakers.
The expansion also will allow the center to lease office space in the facility to area nonprofits with similar missions, said Varas.

“We recognize we can’t fix everything,” he said, adding that providing a common ground where clients can easily access services of other organizations is key to solving a community’s needs.
Existing services of the center will continue without disruption at a temporary site a block away at 4937 S. 24th St. until the renovation is complete.
“The Latino center has long been a cornerstone in our community and this expansion ensures its impact will only grow stronger for generations to come,” Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. said in a statement.
Yesenia Peck, president of the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the center is a standing testament to the drive and vision of the local Latino community. 
“We look forward to the ways it will keep building opportunity and prosperity for Omaha,” she said.
‘More complex needs’
Varas said the needs of immigrants, Latinos and other communities the center serves have evolved and in this era are more complex. He foresees the more modern and larger facility allowing opportunity for a “deeper” response. 
“For over five decades, we’ve walked alongside families in South Omaha. This expansion allows us to grow with them, breaking down barriers, expanding programs and serving more youth and families.”

“If the federal government’s shutdown continues and SNAP benefits are not funded in November, recipients will not receive SNAP benefits for that month,” said the state Department of Social Services. “The federal government has communicated that states would not be reimbursed if they choose to fund benefits to SNAP recipients.”
The federal program provided $14.76 million worth of assistance to 74,459 South Dakotans in September — including 33,198 children. 
Another safety net program supplying food and formula to women, infants and children, known as WIC, is also set to run out of federal funding next week if the shutdown continues. WIC serves about 13,800 South Dakotans monthly.
The South Dakota Department of Health did not answer a question from South Dakota Searchlight asking if the department plans to use state funding to keep the program running.
“At this time, WIC benefits remain available, and the program operations are continuing as normal,” a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Impossible for nonprofits to fill federal funding gap
Food insecurity professionals told members of the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club during a panel discussion on Monday that food shouldn’t be used as a political bargaining chip.
One in five South Dakota children are food insecure, Feeding South Dakota Executive Director Lori Dykstra said. More than 70% of participants in South Dakota’s SNAP program have children in their families.

Dykstra said she understands South Dakota’s decision not to fund November SNAP benefits “from a budgeting standpoint,” but she added that “a lot of states are making those decisions; some states are choosing to fund it.”
New York, for example, will supply $30 million in state emergency food assistance. On Friday, 23 state attorneys general sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and questioned the legal basis for the agency to pause benefits for SNAP.
The state Department of Social Services said it is “closely monitoring federal developments” with the program and working to connect people with local resources, including through the Helpline Center. The department’s website says remaining balances from October and earlier will stay available for use.
Panelists encouraged South Dakotans to volunteer their time or donate to food pantries across the state.
Dykstra added that Feeding South Dakota is working to create an emergency response plan to address a spike in food insecurity if the shutdown continues. The hunger relief nonprofit already lost 1.5 million pounds of food to federal cuts in March. 
“We need to be prepared,” Dykstra said. “But we also can’t meet the entire gap.”
For every one meal Feeding South Dakota provides, SNAP provides nine. “We cannot make that up in a matter of a couple of weeks,” Dykstra added.
Disruption could stress hospital systems, child safety
Stasia Elsinger, a dietitian with Avera Health, told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel discussion that she expects hospitalizations to rise across South Dakota if SNAP benefits end — especially in areas of the state with high rates of diabetes and other chronic illnesses. Native Americans are 1.8 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than other South Dakotans, according to the state Department of Health.

“We are all one medical diagnosis, one car accident, one family emergency away from also being food insecure,” Elsinger told Rotary members. “We have patients who went from doing great to needing to utilize programs like these just to survive. We see it every day, and we’re seeing it more and more now.”
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe declared a state of emergency due to the government shutdown over the weekend, citing the temporary impact to SNAP and WIC programs.
Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff said in a Board of Social Services meeting earlier this month that the department is “crossing our fingers that reason prevails in Washington” to continue the SNAP program.
Board member Stacey Tieszen said at the meeting that the fallout from the disrupted program will happen right away and could cost the state more in the long run. Tieszen serves as CEO of the Sioux Falls Area Court Appointed Special Advocate nonprofit.
“Families that are stressed are not good parents. Those parents might end up making poor choices,” Tieszen said at the time. “That might lead to substance abuse issues; they might hurt their children. Then that all impacts DSS because then there are removals and foster care.”
SNAP loss could hurt grocery stores
Dykstra told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel that the loss of SNAP benefits would impact the state economically, and is especially important for rural grocery stores.
“I don’t want to see more closures,” Dykstra said.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

RF Buche, president and CEO of GF Buche Co. in South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that his stores stay open past midnight on days that benefits are loaded on SNAP cards — the 10th of each month.
All 25 stores owned by Buche, which include Buche Foods and Gus Stops, are on or near tribal land. A majority of Buche’s customers use SNAP, he added.
Parents carry or push their sleeping children in carts as they stock up for the month, Buche said, adding that some customers likely “haven’t eaten in days.” He added that if the SNAP funding is disrupted, it’ll be “devastating” for communities he serves.
“I don’t know how anybody in good conscience could sit there and not worry about those struggles,” Buche said.
Team Buche Cares had been planning to donate 50,000 Thanksgiving meals this year, but Buche said he now plans to give $100 worth of groceries per SNAP household if the shutdown continues past Nov. 10. If the shutdown ends before then, he plans to use that money for Thanksgiving.
“Unfortunately, we may not have the choice to get to Thanksgiving,” Buche said. “I don’t think starvation will wait around until Team Buche Cares provides Thanksgiving meals. It’s going to begin November 10th.”

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Customers shouldn’t be on the hook for nearly $50 million in cost overruns NorthWestern Energy incurred to build the Yellowstone County Generating Station, according to the Montana Consumer Counsel.
Those “substantial” overruns stem from “unnecessary development risks” NorthWestern Energy took to build the plant, according to briefing from the state’s consumer watchdog in an open rate case before the Montana Public Service Commission.
The plant, built without preapproval from the PSC, was estimated to have cost $320 million in August 2024.
In briefing, the Montana Consumer Counsel argues the PSC should not relieve NorthWestern of “any responsibility” for additional costs related to the plant and associated returns it “seeks to fully recover from ratepayers.”
But the Montana Consumer Counsel isn’t the only party that’s arguing NorthWestern took “unnecessary” risks in developing the plant and the Public Service Commission should turn down its request to recover costs from customers.
In fact, one group of parties, the Joint Parties, argues NorthWestern isn’t entitled to recover costs from the “imprudent investment” at all given “less-costly and less-risky alternatives” were available.
The Joint Parties are comprised of the Montana Environmental Information Center, Human Resource Council District XI, Natural Resources Defense Council, and NW Energy Coalition.
The costs of the Yellowstone County Generating Station, a methane-fired electrical generation plant in Laurel, are one major contested issue in a significant case pending before the Public Service Commission.
The case was heard before the PSC in June, and a recommendation from agency staff is expected to be released in November.
NorthWestern Energy argues the plant is needed and is already saving customers money — $11.08 a month on average, or 9%, for residential customers as of Oct. 1.
In an email, NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the plant, operating since October 2024, has been helping serve customers “more affordably and reliably.”
“It supports the grid during high demand and balances the ups and downs of wind and solar power,” Black said in an email. “By using YCGS, NorthWestern avoids buying more expensive energy from the market and can sell extra power when it’s not needed locally — benefiting customers.”
(Black did not respond to a question about whether the entire plant is online yet; two of the 18 units were not working when the plant started running.)
Typically, NorthWestern and other parties negotiate settlements in large cases before the Public Service Commission, and then they request approval from regulators.
In this case, four agreements are pending approval from the PSC, but the costs of the Yellowstone plant are a sticking point for most of the parties in the case besides NorthWestern Energy itself.
 Cost overruns

The Montana Consumer Counsel argues NorthWestern’s request for $305.5 million in total Yellowstone plant construction costs represents “a significant increase” to estimates it presented the PSC.
As recently as a 2022 case, NorthWestern estimated total construction costs at $256 million, the Consumer Counsel said.
The company included contingency costs, but it still underestimated construction by at least $49.5 million, and it wants customers to pay for the consequences of its own risks, writes the Montana Consumer Counsel.
It said NorthWestern wants the PSC to approve an annual rate increase of $47.9 million associated with the plant, which presumes recovery of $287.5 million in construction costs, an amount that includes a reduction for a couple of units not yet online.
But the Consumer Counsel argues cost overruns were poorly documented, and the Public Service Commission can hold NorthWestern accountable by disallowing $48 million in cost overruns.
NorthWestern, however, argues the cost overruns, or “construction change orders,” weren’t the fault of the utility.
It said some of the delays were due to lawsuits “caused by environmental groups,” and others from “force majeure events,” such as supply chain disruptions, a fire at a copper factory, a shutdown in China, and the Yellowstone River flood.
But the Large Customer Group (which represents a coalition of large businesses such as refineries) and Federal Executive Agencies agreed with the Montana Consumer Counsel.
It said the PSC should ensure “NorthWestern’s customers are not bearing the burden of compensating the company for its lack of cost discipline.” It said cutting out cost overruns should translate into $12.2 million in reduced revenue requirement too, citing the MCC.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities, and as such, acts as “a substitute for competitive markets,” the groups argue. And competitive markets are “ruthless,” the groups state, citing a NorthWestern witness.
“For regulators to act in place of the market, which provides no safeguards for poor decision-making, they must disallow imprudent costs and preventable cost overruns,” the groups said. “Otherwise, utilities lack important incentives to prevent such negative cost incurrences in the future.”
 No preapproval from PSC

NorthWestern built the plant without preapproval, so it should own the results of its decision, argued multiple parties.
The record shows NorthWestern was aware of the “greater risks” of building a large fossil fuel facility “in a time of significant economic uncertainty,” but it still withdrew its request for preapproval by the Public Service Commission, argue the Joint Parties.
The utility withdrew its request for preapproval before a ruling by the PSC or even a hearing, and as such, it assumed all the risks of the action, the parties said.
But preapproval isn’t required, and in its own plea to the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern said just because an action is risky doesn’t make it imprudent. The utility also pointed out that when a different project cost less than estimated, the Montana Consumer Counsel wanted the PSC to approve the actual costs.
“This arbitrary reasoning is unhelpful to the commission, which must be principled in exercising its rate-setting authority,” NorthWestern said in its brief.
 Gaming the system, parties say

In fact, another participant in the case, Renewable Northwest, and other parties argue NorthWestern never even proved the plant was needed; it intentionally manipulated a procurement process to engineer the outcome it wanted by using a method no other utility uses.
And constructing its own plant would be a favorable outcome for NorthWestern because utilities profit from such expenses, argue the Joint Parties.
“Natural gas generation is expensive and along with associated infrastructure would significantly add to the company’s rate base,” on which they earn a rate of return, the Joint Parties said in documents.
NorthWestern said it followed “a deliberate, cautious process,” and it used the Public Service Commission’s own planning and procurement guidelines. It said other parties were included, and the PSC never told NorthWestern to stop or even pause in the selection process.
But the Public Service Commission had informed NorthWestern about flaws in its process, argued the Large Customer Group. It said NorthWestern moved ahead anyway, knowing in advance the investment was “more likely to experience cost disallowance.”
The Montana Consumer Counsel said evidence showed other bids NorthWestern considered “represented more competitive and less risky options” compared to the Yellowstone plant, citing testimony from a professor emeritus of energy studies and consulting economist, David Dismukes.
“In particular, he (Dismukes) noted that an existing natural gas combined-cycle generation turbine (“CCGT”) option consistently had the lowest cost across all of NorthWestern’s planning sensitivity scenarios,” wrote the Montana Consumer Counsel.
NorthWestern passed on “such turn-key options” and chose to build its own generation, an option “it knew or should have known would be vulnerable to legal challenges, contested permitting, environmental and other public opposition, significant cost overruns, and multiple claims of force majeure as construction proceeded,” said the Montana Consumer Counsel.
In fact, the Joint Parties said NorthWestern itself reported such risks in one of its reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The parties argued the Public Service Commission should cap the additional costs it allows NorthWestern to include in its base rates to the amount it would have incurred through “reasonable” planning — if it adds any capital costs at all.
Details about the more affordable CCGT option are redacted in the briefs and in filed testimony.
Renewable Northwest said evidence in the record shows NorthWestern used “non-industry standard planning practices” to model its resource needs, and in doing so, “exposed Montana to the risk of unjust and unreasonable rates.”
It has since obfuscated answers to questions in the case, making it impossible to find the utility prudently incurred costs, according to the brief.
“NorthWestern’s planning practices have effectively placed a thumb on the scale when it comes to resource selection and rendered it impossible for the utility to meet its burden to demonstrate that the portfolio for which it now seeks to recover costs from Montana consumers was prudently conceived,” Renewable Northwest said.
It argued the Public Service Commission should conduct a full review and require NorthWestern to demonstrate its request is “based on just and reasonable rates and is in the public interest.”
NorthWestern, though, argues the other parties misunderstand one “fundamental issue” in the case, and that’s reliability.
“If the commission accepts their arguments and discourages investment in NorthWestern’s system by disallowing costs recovery for investments like the Yellowstone County Generating Station, then it inhibits NorthWestern’s ability to provide reliable service,” NorthWestern said in briefing.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant2.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 23:28:58+00:00,CT Mirror,"With Marissa Gillett gone, legal battles still plague PURA",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/pura-marissa-gillett-lawsuits-pending/,A pair of lawsuits remain pending in state courts as of this week alleging wrongdoing by the former PURA chair prior to her resignation.,"The departure earlier this month of the embattled chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, Marissa Gillett, wasn’t enough to quell a longstanding series of disputes between Connecticut’s utilities and their state regulators.
A pair of lawsuits remain pending in state courts as of this week alleging wrongdoing by Gillett prior to her resignation. Utility officials, including those at Eversource and United Illuminating, accuse the former chair of wielding unilateral control over the authority throughout her six-year tenure.
If successful, the lawsuits could force PURA to relitigate at least one case in which it denied the rate increases sought by two gas companies owned by UI’s parent company, Avangrid.
In addition, attorneys for the utilities are continuing their fight to uncover records they say will showcase Gillett’s alleged anti-utility bias — with the potential to further undermine past and pending decisions by PURA. 
On Monday, the utilities scored an initial victory when PURA offered to resolve one of the lawsuits by conceding that Gillett had violated the law by appointing herself as the “presiding officer” over cases without the approval of her fellow commissioners.
Gillett did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
Another recent controversy arising from PURA has to do with the authority’s general counsel, Scott Muska. On Friday, a blog run by former state lawmaker Kevin Rennie published an email in which PURA Executive Secretary Jeff Gaudiosi accused Muska of flouting public records laws and giving “intentionally misleading and false” information under oath.
Muska could not be reached for comment on Monday. A spokeswoman for PURA declined to comment on the allegation, citing an “active personnel investigation.”
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office also declined to comment specifically on the allegation against Muska. A spokesman for the governor, Rob Blanchard, said lawsuits were counterproductive to Lamont’s efforts to reset the relationship between PURA and the utilities — which began with his appointment of four new members to the authority’s board, including new chairman Thomas Wiehl.
“He certainly wants to see things move forward, and continuing litigation is not going to help things in that case,” Blanchard said. 
A spokeswoman for Eversource, Tricia Modifica, said in a statement Monday that the company was looking forward to working with Wiehl and the new slate of commissioners. Still, she argued that further scrutiny of Gillett’s actions as chair is warranted.
“Lawful, transparent, and consistent regulatory processes are all essential in order for regulated utilities to provide value to customers for their electric, heat, and water service,” Modifica said. “When that process is opaque and purposely undermined for inappropriate purposes, there is harm. Customers in Connecticut have the right to know what regulatory decisions were made in this manner; how those decisions were made; and what led to various changes to their bills in recent years and, importantly, in future years.”
A spokesperson for Avangrid declined to comment Monday on the company’s active lawsuits.
The allegation against Muska appeared to stem from a lawsuit filed by Avangrid’s two gas utilities, Connecticut Natural Gas Co. and Southern Connecticut Gas. While the case is nominally about PURA’s 2024 decision to slash the companies’ combined revenues by $35 million, attorneys for Avangrid have focused much of their attention on Gillett and whether or not she played a role in drafting an op-ed last year accusing the utilities of spreading “propaganda” regarding their finances.
If Gillett helped write the piece — an allegation both she and authors have repeatedly denied, including under oath — then she should have recused herself from weighing in on the companies’ rate cases, the attorneys argue.
During a hearing in the case in June, Gillett revealed through her attorneys that her personal cell phone had been set to automatically delete text messages after a period of 30 days. The revelation came months after attorneys for Avangrid had first sought access to the chair’s communications — and too late for text messages she exchanged with one of the op-ed’s authors to be recovered.
Since then, the judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, has been probing PURA and about why the disclosure regarding Gillett’s text messages was not made sooner.
At another hearing last week, Budzik reportedly said he was holding Muska and Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander responsible for misleading the court, according to the Hartford Courant. The paper also reported that Hollander told the judge that “someone at PURA” was aware of the deletion function on Gillett’s phone, but chose not notify the court earlier.
PURA, meanwhile, has offered to resolve the case by agreeing to reconsider the gas companies’ request for a rate increase. Avangrid’s attorneys have rejected that offer for the time being, arguing that the authority is merely seeking to cover up “inconvenient facts” surrounding Gillett’s tenure. (PURA re-upped its offer on Monday, adding the stipulation that Gillett’s actions while overseeing the case were illegal. Avangrid has yet to respond to that filing.)
In a notice to the court on Monday, Avangrid’s attorneys referred to Gaudiosi as a “whistleblower” and used his allegations against Muska, PURA’s general counsel, to bolster their request to depose the authors of the op-ed. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office declined to comment on the allegations.
“Mr. Guadiosi’s [sic] disclosures further demonstrate a deeply rooted culture of noncompliance with document retention and production obligations at the highest levels of PURA,” the company’s filing states. “They also provide additional evidence of PURA’s subversion of its discovery obligations in these very proceedings.”
Budzik has yet to issue a ruling on either the company’s request or PURA’s offer to reconsider the underlying rate case. 
Gaudiosi was also set to appear on Monday before the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission to testify on a complaint lodged last year by Eversource alleging that PURA had failed to adequately respond to the company’s public records requests. 
That hearing was postponed, however, after the state attorney general’s office filed a notice with the commission stating that “previously unknown information and allegations” were likely to be presented at the hearing. Assistant Attorney General James Zimmer, who is representing PURA in that matter, said he needed more time to prepare a response to the allegations.
The other pending lawsuit alleging wrongdoing dates back to January when a coalition of the state’s largest utilities sued PURA, alleging Gillett had sidelined her fellow commissioners by appointing herself the presiding officer over hundreds of cases and issuing rulings under the guise of the authority. Earlier this month the judge overseeing that case, Elizabeth J. Stewart, dismissed both the state and PURA from the lawsuit on immunity grounds.
However, she allowed the suit to continue against Gillett and two of her fellow commissioners, David Arconti and Michael Caron. 
During a hearing in that case last week in Hartford, Thomas Murphy, an attorney for the utilities, sought permission to depose six members of PURA’s staff, including Gaudiosi, Caron and former commissioner Jack Betkoski. Murphy said the depositions were necessary to shed light on the practices that were put in place under Gillett while the agency transitions toward new leadership.
“The best thing for the new commissioners is that they know what happened in the past,” Murphy said. 
Stewart, the judge, blocked such depositions from taking place for the time being, but scheduled another hearing in the case for Nov. 3.
PURA’s filing on Monday — conceding that Gillett’s practice of appointing herself presiding officer had violated state law — was submitted by Hollander, the assistant attorney general. He also noted that PURA had agreed to modify its procedures to comply with the law.
The ongoing lawsuits are also taking place as PURA is due to issue a series of major rulings over the next month. Those cases include requests to raise rates for customers of both United Illuminating and the Yankee Gas Company, as well as a proposed sale of Eversource’s Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
The first of those decisions, UI’s request for a rate increase on its electric customers, is due to be released on Tuesday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

MLB leaders haven’t released any team expansion plans, and won’t do so until MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred steps down from his role in 2029. But, with baseball insiders putting Salt Lake City on a shortlist of potential expansion markets, the Larry H. Miller Company, which is developing the district, hopes to have a foundation ready to host professional baseball. 
“It’s a physical symbol that there’s progress being made at a site that would be the perfect location for Major League Baseball,” Steve Starks, CEO at the Larry H. Miller Company said on Monday, “and so when baseball gets ready to expand, and the owners decide, the commissioner is ready, they’ll look at this site and they’ll see there’s already momentum.”
SLC may not have an MLB team yet, but has a deadline if it wants a say in stadium plans

When finished, the campus will join a 100-acre sports and entertainment district that aspires to become an extension of downtown and is governed by a state-appointed authority born out of a law the Utah Legislature approved in 2024. That legislation also created a tax structure to raise up to $900 million to help fund the stadium.   
Since the law passed, the Larry H. Miller Company has done remediation work, advanced development agreements, and updated its vision for the site, Starks said. If everything goes according to plan, a new stadium will be shovel-ready within 12 months, only awaiting word from the MLB. 
But, regardless of whether Salt Lake City gets a baseball team or not, the Power District will become a new multiuse hub, Starks said, with access to a clean Jordan River, thousands of people living on the site, other offices, restaurants and entertainment options.
The Power District master plan includes 4,700 housing units, with a mixture of housing types and price points, according to a news release, as well as 320,000 square feet dedicated to retail, 300 hotel rooms, one mile of riverfront clean-up and access, trails and green spaces.

Tremonton Republican Sen. Scott Sandall, who chairs the Utah Fairpark Area Investment and Restoration District Board, also known as UFAIR, said he expects it all to come together in the next three to five years. But, now that the district’s governing body is in place, he doesn’t think more legislation will be needed for the district during the next general session. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“That legislation is already in place, and UFAIR is responsible for the state’s part of a ballpark when the Major League announcement happens,” Sandall said. “I’m just going to be positive about that.”  
While city input is more limited for this project than it was with the Downtown Revitalization District — created to accommodate Utah’s NHL team — Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said on Monday she is excited about the possibilities for the west side of the city, an area that’s home to the state’s most diverse communities. 
“Today marks the beginning of a catalytic investment in this neighborhood that this neighborhood has not only wanted but deserved for a very long time,” Mendenhall said. “It’s part of a growing momentum that we’re seeing all across the west side, where community vision is converging with long planned public improvements and private investment.”
Mendenhall also called for this new chapter of the west side to go hand in hand with sustainability. She highlighted Salt Lake City’s commitment, alongside other Utah communities, to match its electricity consumption with renewable energy generation through Rocky Mountain Power’s system.
“Our entire state needs those improvements, but few places more than the west side of Salt Lake City, which has disproportionately suffered from poor air quality in the past,” Mendenhall said.

Brian Gootkin has served as the head of Montana’s Department of Corrections since 2021.
Gootkin will have to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, which is moving quickly to install Trump’s nominees. The Republican-majority U.S. Senate changed its rules this fall to move Trump’s nominees through faster.
The Governor’s Office did not immediately respond to a Monday question seeking comment on when they expect to have a new agency head. The Department of Corrections did not answer questions sent on Friday regarding Gootkin’s move.

“Under his direction, we’ve made historic investments to protect and promote a public safety system that supports inmates, corrections officers, and all Montana families,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a statement. “From securing overdue improvements to aging infrastructure, expanding capacity at our jails, and increasing collaboration with local partners, Gootkin has been at the helm of our work.”
Members of Montana’s all-Republican federal delegation applauded the move.
U.S. Senator Steve Daines called Gootkin an “excellent choice” for the position, and U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy agreed.
“Senate Republicans have overcome historic obstruction to get President Trump’s picks in place, and we are eager to add Brian to the list of fantastic nominees that have been confirmed,” Sheehy said in a press release.
Prior to Gootkin’s position in the DOC, he spent 27 years in the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office. Before that, he spent four years in the Air Force. If confirmed, Gootkin will be Montana’s 41st Marshal for the District of Montana.
Craig Anderson is the U.S. Marshal for Montana, and the Department of Justice webpage still lists him in that position. Marshals currently are under the U.S. Attorney’s authority, though there was legislation introduced this year seeking to take it out of the President and Justice Department’s hands.
There are 94 Marshals in Districts across the world, which are appointed by the President or Attorney General. U.S. Marshals are in part responsible for courthouse security, prisoner transport and apprehension of suspects.

While part of an Equality State tradition, Karpan also blazed a trail all her own as the first woman elected to a statewide office “other than superintendent, who wasn’t a widow, who in effect had the benefit of her husband having held office before her,” Karpan told the Wyoming Historical Society in an interview last year. 
“My message to women in Wyoming would be: Don’t be afraid to run. Take the chance, you might win,” Karpan said in the interview. 
A lifelong Democrat, Karpan was not always on the winning side of Wyoming politics. She ran for governor and U.S. senator in 1994 and 1996, respectively, but lost to Republicans both times. Meanwhile, Karpan was a mentor to many, her longtime friend Rodger McDaniel told WyoFile on Monday.

“I’ve heard from young people who were candidates for, typically, the Legislature, for whom she was a mentor. They all described her as a mentor, somebody they could talk to, and she would reach out and offer them advice and direction,” McDaniel said. “And she did that her whole life.”
Karpan’s penchant for mentorship, McDaniel said, grew in part from her time working for Teno Roncalio, the last Democrat to have represented Wyoming in Congress. 
“Teno was somebody who believed in mentoring and bringing people along who had potential for involvement in politics and public service. And Kathy did the same thing as secretary of state,” McDaniel said. 
From Roncalio, Karpan said she learned that public service and political life could be a way to “help individual human beings.”
“Because when I worked for him, we helped constituents,” Karpan told the Wyoming Historical Society. 
It was while serving as the director of the Wyoming Department of Health in 1986 that Karpan kicked off a campaign for secretary of state. She won and did so again in 1990. During her tenure, she oversaw the first statewide special election in Wyoming history. Karpan also helped spearhead the state’s revamping of its limited liability statutes — an endeavor that inspired the rest of the country’s business regulations. 
“Former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan was a strong leader who left a lasting legacy on Wyoming. Through much-needed reforms in the Secretary of State’s office to providing a shining example of what serving in a public office is all about,” Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Lucas Fralick wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “Secretary Karpan will be dearly missed by those who knew her, and we will continue to strive to serve by her example.”
Early life and career 
Karpan was born in Rock Springs in 1942, when the city was a Democratic stronghold thanks to the community’s unionized coal miners, according to wyohistory.org. 
“In first grade, I knew that I was a Catholic and a Democrat,” she said.

The family moved to Rawlins after her father’s job with the Union Pacific Railroad was transferred. After Karpan’s mother died when she was 12 years old, Karpan helped raise her two younger siblings, Judy and Frank. 
Given such responsibilities, a higher education was thought to be out of reach for Karpan, but a scholarship to the University of Wyoming College of Commerce and Industry changed that. She earned a degree in journalism and served as editor of The Branding Iron. Years later, she graduated with a master’s degree in American Studies at UW and from the University of Oregon’s School of Law in 1978. 
In Washington, she got a job in the Department of Commerce. Closer to home, she worked in the Wyoming attorney general’s office. In 1997, the U.S. Senate confirmed Karpan as director of the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement at the Department of the Interior — a full circle moment for the coal miner’s daughter. 
In private practice, where she worked in her later years, she was “an excellent lawyer,” McDaniel told WyoFile.

Her longtime legal partner, Margy White, spoke of Karpan’s “enviable sense of humor” in a 2016 interview with wyohistory.org. 
“My personal favorite story of Kathy practicing law arose from a deposition she took of a person who had only a fleeting acquaintance with the concept of truth. After the deposition, Kathy said if and when we called this person to testify at trial, she would say, ‘the plaintiff would like to call Pinocchio to the stand,’” White said. 
Karpan was also an insatiable reader. When she and McDaniel, who both worked for U.S. Rep. Roncalio at the time, would travel around Wyoming, Karpan “would read aloud books like Lyndon Johnson’s biography,” McDaniel said. 
“She was really a wonderful friend,” he said. 
Last year, Karpan lamented the Wyoming Legislature’s shrunken number of women members and the “brutality” and “mean-spiritedness” of the current state of politics. Yet, Karpan expressed hope for “the best and the brightest and the most caring and generous and tolerant and loving of our young people” running for office. 
“I’d like to think that my legacy would be: Jump in, get involved, run,” Karpan said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 22:59:29+00:00,CT Mirror,"Facing loss of SNAP, CT increases funding for Foodshare",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/facing-loss-of-snap-ct-increases-funding-for-foodshare/,"Officials acknowledged that the $3 million grant will not match the reach of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits in CT.","Connecticut’s first steps to mitigate the fast-approaching suspension of a federally funded food assistance program will be a $3 million emergency grant to nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare and an outreach campaign informing recipients of their nearest food pantry, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday.
The partial federal government shutdown forced by the inability of Congress to pass even a temporary spending measure will enter its second month on Saturday, the same day funding runs out for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.
But the governor and others acknowledged that the emergency step will not match the reach or efficiency of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards that can be used to purchase food at chain supermarkets and many corner stores and farmers’ markets.
SNAP serves about 360,000 people in Connecticut, about 10% of the state’s population. It largely serves the working poor and struggling retirees whose monthly incomes are no more than $2,609 for a single person and $5,359 for a household of four.
Connecticut is one of the earliest states to address the near-certain suspension of SNAP. Last week, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, declared a state of emergency allowing unspecified actions to provide greater food aid in the absence of SNAP.
The steps announced Monday afternoon at Connecticut Foodshare’s office and warehouse complex in Wallingford came after hurried meetings with officials from the Lamont administration and the statewide nonprofit, which acts as a wholesale and retail distributor of free food to pantries and individuals.
Lamont praised his commissioner of social services, Andrea Barton Reeves, and the Foodshare chief executive, Jason Jakubowski, for quickly assembling a plan in the face of uncertainty from Washington as to whether the Trump administration would use available contingency funds to keep SNAP going.
“They were going to replenish the SNAP benefits, and they weren’t going to replenish it. Turn the card on, turn it off. It is, let’s say erratic, to put it mildly,” Lamont said. “We wanted to pull the trigger and make sure we can take care of people in time for the cards going off.”
Lamont said the state will monitor whether further spending is necessary.
“We’re going to try this out for a couple of weeks,” Lamont said. “We’re going to see what the need is going forward. You know, hopefully they can solve this impasse down in Washington. I think it’s a long overdue, but if not, I think we’ll be here to help out people as best we can.”
The state is unable to simply put more money on the electronic benefits cards already in the hands of SNAP recipients. The state screens for eligibility, but a federal vendor actually uses the state data to reload the cards, Barton Reeves said.
“As a state, we don’t have any access to those particular funds and the ways in which those cards are loaded. We simply determine whether a person is eligible for the SNAP benefit or not,” she said.
Jakubowski said the $3 million would be used to purchase food that would increase the supplies already distributed through a network of food pantries and the 110 mobile distribution sites that are visited once every two weeks. But, he acknowledged, it would not come close to offsetting the loss of SNAP.
“SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in the state of Connecticut and in the United States,” he said. “For every meal that we provide here at this food bank, SNAP provides nine. There is not enough food at this food bank — or every food bank in the country put together — to make up for the loss that we’re going to see in SNAP.”
Jakubowski also said the suspension of SNAP also would be a blow to supermarkets that operate on thin margins.
“There’s 2,500 retail outlets in the state of Connecticut that accept SNAP dollars. It’s anywhere from 5 to 15% of their business. This is going to hurt the economy just as much as it’s going to hurt working families across the state,” he said.
Jakubowski said the SNAP issue exacerbates what already was a difficult time for Foodshare and the pantries it supplies. The Trump administration previously canceled agricultural programs that had supplied fresh produce.
From October of last year, the nonprofit has received 850,000 fewer pounds of food from the federal government while servicing 23% more households across the state, he said. 
Lamont, Barton Reeves and Jakubowski downplayed the politics of the impasse in Washington. Others at the press conference did not.
“We ask our Congress and our federal government to step up and fix this problem,” Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said. “We are leading in a bipartisan way here in Connecticut, and I find it incredible that our congressmen are being paid while our federal workers who are doing public safety and health related critical infrastructure work in our country are not being paid and are also at risk of going hungry.”
Standing behind her was U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-3rd District, who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.
“Some of us have have deferred our salary during the shutdown,” DeLauro said, as she stepped to the microphone. “Not everyone, but some of us have.”
DeLauro said responsibility for the SNAP suspension is with Trump. Even in the absence of a federal budget or continuing resolution, there is a $5 billion contingency fund set aside for SNAP, which the Trump administration refuses to use.
“I promise you, there is money to fund this program,” DeLauro said.
Youngkin, the Virginia governor, blamed Democrats in Congress in his emergency declaration announcement.
Democrats have declined to agree to a continuing resolution keeping the government open without an extension of tax credits whose expiration at year’s end will cause dramatic increases in the cost of buying health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Rep. Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who is the House Republican leader, issued a statement earlier criticizing Democratic leaders in the General Assembly who were trying to create a new contingency fund to deal with federal cutbacks, rather than simply using the state’s ample budget reserves.
But Candelora attended the press conference and praised the governor’s first steps to offset the SNAP loss.
“No question we are broken at the federal level,” Candelora said. “There is an impasse that neither side of the aisle wants to break. People are being leveraged now, and people are being hurt. And I stand in support of the governor’s first initiative, and I think it’s just the beginning of a conversation. We all know that $3 million is going to go away very quickly, and it’s also not a substitution for SNAP.”
Lamont, whose voice was hoarse from a heavy cold, left the press conference early. He has no public schedule on Tuesday.

Wyoming beef producers watch prices plunge with the president’s plan to quadruple imports from Argentina.
The post Trump’s Argentine beef move causes ‘great concern, some panic’ appeared first on WyoFile .","President Donald Trump’s announcements that the U.S. will allow Argentina to greatly expand its low-tariff beef exports to the U.S. to reduce prices for American consumers have riled Wyoming stock growers.
Trump floated the idea of boosting imports to the U.S. market a week ago, following up with statements that Argentina would be allowed to quadruple the amount of beef it sends north under a low-tariff quota. The move brought a sharp reaction from domestic beef producers as well as markets, which saw cattle prices plunge.
“The president’s statement obviously caused us great concern and some panic in our industry,” said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. “It has had an impact on current live cattle prices and our futures market.”
“The timing is so unfortunate for Wyoming. We’re at that time of the year where people are selling their calves or their yearlings.” Jim Magagna
Magagna cautioned that details of the deal are yet to be made public — whether the plan involves live cattle or only butchered products. Regardless, “it can have a significant impact,” Magagna said of the new policy.
“The timing is so unfortunate for Wyoming,” Magagna said. “We’re at that time of the year where people are selling their calves or their yearlings.”
Gov. Mark Gordon called for domestic solutions to higher grocery prices, solutions that would increase U.S.-raised beef. “Increasing our reliance on cattle imports is not the best answer for our ranchers, farmers, or U.S. consumers,” he said in a statement Thursday.
Trump’s move is a “misguided effort,” the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement Wednesday, calling on him to abandon the plan. The association and its members “cannot stand behind the president while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers,” the group’s CEO Colin Woodall said in a release.
‘$300 millones extra’
In Argentina, headlines heralded a windfall for a troubled economy. “Inminente anuncio: la mayor cuota para exportar carne a Estados Unidos generará US $300 millones extra,” La Nación trumpeted. Translation: “Imminent announcement: Increased meat export quota to the United States will generate an additional $300 million.”
In Chicago, headlines were different. “Cattle Collapsing as Spec Longs Head for the Exits,” Barchart for Businesses wrote Monday.
“The cattle complex on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is deepening its steep losses in early Monday trading,” Foodmarket news wrote Monday, “extending Friday’s sharp sell-off that saw all but the nearby live cattle contract end at limit-down.”
In addition to benefiting U.S. meat consumers, Trump’s beef plan augments his support for the Argentinian government, support that includes a $20 billion currency swap. The issue finds the White House trapped between consumer dread in the face of escalating costs and stock producers who are part of a rural cohort of Trump voters.
There’s been much criticism of Trump’s move from rural producers, Rona Johnson wrote Monday on The Fence Post, an ag-focused news outlet. “Most of these ranchers probably voted for Trump,” she wrote, “and were voicing their concerns in hopes that he would come to a different conclusion on how to deal with high beef prices.”
Meantime, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday released a 13-page outline “to strengthen the American beef industry, reinforcing and prioritizing the American rancher’s critical role in the national security of the United States.” The initiative lists 18 actions, implementation plans and expected results addressing everything from grazing on federal land to compensation for stock losses to predators.
Gubernatorial candidate and State Sen. Eric Barlow, a Gillette Republican, “stands with Wyoming ranchers,” he said in a statement issued Friday. “Our producers compete honestly and deserve fair markets that reflect the true value of locally raised beef.”
Conservationists fret the issue will lead to environmental degradation as the administration relaxes oversight and control of public-land grazing and other landscape and wildlife protections.
“This administration is doubling down and making sure that America’s precious western public lands operate as a below-cost feedlot for special interest groups,” Josh Osher, public policy director for Western Watersheds Project said in a statement. The administration’s moves come “despite the growing recognition that beef is bad for the planet.”
Rollins’ proposals to expand grazing on public land come even as land-managing agencies’ data “suggest that they are unable to manage the active allotments already in use,” Western Watersheds and five other environmental groups said.
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, WildEarth Guardians, Wilderness Watch, the Center for Biological Diversity and Kettle Range Conservation Group joined in the criticism.
Bad timing
Wyoming ranchers are in a tough spot, Magagna said. Some may have sold their cattle already.
“But if you hadn’t sold them and you’re sending them to market next week, it’s definitely going to be an impact,” he said, “a short-term impact.”
Again, details of the deal will be paramount.
“The challenge that I’ve had with this is, to my knowledge, we don’t yet know what the president has in mind,” he said. “I’ve heard rumors he’s talking about importing live animals from Argentina.
“I don’t think that could be done,” he said. “It would be a major concern because of animal disease issues.”
Other programs, like importing butchered lean beef to be blended with U.S. products, could benefit the industry, Magagna said.
He’s reached out to association members, Magagna said, providing a link to comment to the administration and Wyoming’s delegation. “The last I knew — not specific to Wyoming — somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 comments had been submitted by cattle producers.”
Regarding U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, “I know they have reached out to the White House and to the Secretary of Ag to express their concerns,” he said.

(Photo by Carol Yepes/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the Des Moines Register, its parent company Gannett and pollster J. Ann Selzer will head from federal court to state court in Iowa, a positive development for the president in the proceedings.
The lawsuit was filed in December 2024 after Trump’s victory in the general election. It challenges the Des Moines Register and Selzer, who conducted the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, for publishing a poll in the days before the Nov. 5, 2024, election that found Vice President Kamala Harris leading among likely Iowa voters.
The lawsuit claimed the poll amounted to “fraud and election interference,” saying it had intentionally overrepresented support for Harris in violation of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. But attorneys representing the defendants denied these claims and the case was transferred to federal court at their request.
However, Trump’s legal team objected to the case going through the federal court system, as the lawsuit had been expanded to include U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and former Republican state Sen. Brad Zaun  — both based in Iowa – as plaintiffs.
In May 2025, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied the president’s motion to remand the case from federal court back to state court, allowing Trump to file an appeal on the issue but ordering him to fine an amended complaint without Miller-Meeks and Zaun involved in the case.
But on Friday, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit overruled this decision, granting Trump’s petition for a writ of mandamus, used to correct legal errors, and calling for the district court to “vacate its order striking the notice of voluntary dismissal and treat the case as dismissed without prejudice.”
This decision may allow Trump’s case, refiled June 30 in Iowa, to proceed, as it had not advanced due to challenges about the pending federal case.
In a statement, Lark-Marie Anton, Gannett spokesperson, said the company is  “assessing the court’s decision.”
“Given the nature of the case and that it involves the president of the United States as a plaintiff, we continue to believe the federal courts are the most appropriate forum for this lawsuit,” Anton said. “In the event the suit is heard by the state courts of Iowa, we have confidence the matter will be adjudicated fairly.”
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, representing Selzer in the lawsuit, has labeled the legal challenge as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP lawsuit attempting to suppress free speech or press by engaging a defendant in a lengthy, expensive legal battle, even while knowing they may not win in court. While Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a measure into law this year allowing courts to to grant expedited relief in cases involving First Amendment rights to address SLAPP lawsuits, the law includes a caveat that these legal protections cannot be filed retroactively — meaning Trump’s refiled case in Iowa would not be subject to the law.

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is restarting abortion services after a nearly month-long pause due to a federal budget and tax law that threatens to withhold Medicaid funding from organizations that provide abortion services.
The organization paused services on Oct. 1, due to a provision in the federal megabill signed by President Donald Trump that bars Medicaid payments for one year to organizations that received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in fiscal year 2023 and primarily engage in family planning services and reproductive health and provide abortions. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin had said the pause was temporary as they explored options for being able to resume. 
The federal Hyde Amendment has prohibited federal funds from being used to pay for most abortion care for nearly five decades, but the new provision, which expires in July 2026, expands that prohibition to cover all Medicaid-covered services at clinics that also provide non-covered abortions. 
“Providing compassionate, high-quality care to our patients has always been our mission — and it always will be,” President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in a statement. “At a time when politicians are working to take away health care from women and families, we are fighting back with everything we have. We’ve been here before. We’ve stood up to relentless attacks on reproductive health for decades — and we are not backing down now. Our patients deserve nothing less.”
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said that it decided to relinquish its “Essential Community Provider” designation, so it won’t meet the definition of a “prohibited entity” under federal law and won’t be barred from receiving Medicaid funds even while it provides abortion services. 
According to KFF, Essential Community Providers are “safety net clinics and hospitals” that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved patients. The federal Affordable Care Act requires that Qualified Health Plans available through the federal or state insurance Marketplaces include a “sufficient number and geographic distribution of ECPs, where available, to ensure reasonable and timely access to a broad range of such providers for low-income, medically underserved individuals in the plan’s service area.”
A Sept. 29 court filing from attorneys on behalf of Health and Human Services stated that organizations could continue billing Medicaid by ceasing abortion, or by relinquishing their tax-exempt status, or relinquishing their Essential Community Provider status.
Atkinson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it was unclear what the implications of giving up the ECP status might be, including whether it will affect its financial situation. 
“What we do know is that the vast majority of our patients really rely on BadgerCare as their form of insurance, and our focus is on providing as much care as we possibly can to as many people as we can across the entire state,” Atkinson said.
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin  — the largest provider for abortion services in the state — offers abortion services at its clinics in Madison, Milwaukee and Sheboygan.

Auditor Mike Foley said the transactions, amounting to nearly $1,000, came despite the department having its own tow trucks.
“It’s a troubling situation where a person is in a position where he can directly order towing services to a company that he owns when in fact the department itself has sufficient towing resources,” he said. “You can not use your position to enhance your own personal financial gain.”
 Insufficient records

Foley’s team, in an 11-page report issued Friday, offered four invoices between April 2024 and July 2025 showing that state purchase cards were used to pay a Wahoo-based business owned by Loren Cuda, the department’s highway fleet shop supervisor.
In three of those instances, the auditor team said, a card was used by a subordinate of Cuda. Foley alleges that Cuda was directing others to steer business to his company. Cuda could not immediately be reached Monday for comment.
Foley said that while transportation employees generally receive verbal approval by a supervisor before making a purchase, such discussion and approval typically is not documented. As a result, the report said, the auditor team was unable to verify whether the towing purchases in question were properly pre-authorized.
The audit team’s report, addressed to Transportation Director Vicki Kramer, said invoices for the four tows lacked sufficient information to verify whether mileage, towing services and additional fee charges were “reasonable.”

Foley said the situation poses concern of a possible violation of the Nebraska Political Accountability and Disclosure Act, which intends to ensure “that public office or employment not be used for private gain other than the compensation provided by law.” 
Foley forwarded the team’s findings and information to the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission for further review. Violators can be subject to misdemeanor charges.
 Transportation response

 The report included a response from leadership of the Transportation Department. The reply noted that Nebraska law does allow, in certain situations, for state agencies to buy goods or services from a vendor associated with a state employee. The department response acknowledged, however, that department procedures “may not be sufficient to prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest.”
As a remedy, the department said it has suspended future purchases from the vendor in question. It said the department is reviewing its processes to determine whether there are additional controls that could “enable purchasing from vendors associated with state employees” while avoiding any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.
The department, through a spokesperson, declined further comment.
Foley said that while transactions with a state employee’s personal business may be legal in certain circumstances, “it wasn’t necessary in this case.” He said he wants to convey a message to state employees and agencies: “We’re watching.”

Two New Mexico state Democratic lawmakers said Monday they will work during next year’s legislative session to establish a “truth commission” to investigate the activities of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein at his Zorro ranch near Stanley in Santa Fe County.
It’s been six years since the financier’s death in a Manhattan jail, but his activities in New Mexico require further exploration, according to state Reps. Andrea Romero (Santa Fe) and Marianna Anaya (Albuquerque), who previewed the process of establishing the commission on a Zoom call with local journalists.
Romero said the commission would “put the story together for the public,” while working around issues of statutes of limitations for certain crimes and the privacy of victims.
“We envision very much like a 9/11 or J-6 commission,” Romero said. “As we start releasing information to the public, it has been vetted. There’s essentially a check and balance on the information that we’re providing: information that needs to be redacted or victims or witnesses that need to be protected.”
Previous House commissions established by the New Mexico Legislature over the decades produced investigative reports on corruption, abuses at schools and prisons.
Establishing this type of commission does not require the approval of both legislative chambers, but instead would be a House parliamentary process, which could be launched during the upcoming session, Romero said.
“We’re unsure if we need sponsors, there’s still a lot of parliamentary history we’re going through,” she told Source NM in a call.
The tentative makeup of the commission would be two Democratic and two Republican House members, with subpoena power. It’s unclear exactly how fast the commission would be able to meet after the session wraps in March, but Romero said it needed to move quickly, and work to “prevent this from ever happening again.”
Romero noted that “we’ve heard from many, many different sources that New Mexico… is a great place to do [trafficking]. That’s just horrifying to me; that there was a choice here to make this a sort of a no man’s land for these activities,” she said.
Epstein purchased the 7,500-acre Zorro Ranch from former New Mexico Gov. Bruce King in 1993. According to court documents, the ranch, which has its own airstrip and helipad, was the site of sex trafficking, including by Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 as Epstein’s co-conspirator.
Two New Mexican attorneys general have opened previous investigations into Epstein’s activities in the state: Hector Balderas’ criminal investigation in 2019 closed within the year without filing any charges. In 2023, current Attorney General Raúl Torrez investigated the role financial services companies played in failing to identify the abuses at the ranch.
Anaya said that while the state pursued a criminal investigation under Balderas, the overlapping jurisdiction with federal investigators hampered it.
“I think the investigation that actually could have happened here, the full-fledged investigation, was maybe unnecessarily put on hold,” Anaya said. “We do have some documents from that, but it’s definitely not comprehensive.”
At the federal level, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury serves on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has been releasing documents from the 2019 federal sex trafficking case against Epstein. Recent documents included an alleged lewd image and inscription from President Donald Trump to Epstein for his 50th birthday.
Romero said the commission will likely be discussed during an upcoming interim Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee meeting in November.

,DC,2025-10-27 22:25:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Thousands of preschoolers could lose access to Head Start due to shutdown,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/thousands-preschoolers-could-lose-access-head-start-due-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — Funding for scores of Head Start programs hung in the balance as the government shutdown continued Monday without an end in sight. Unless a deal is reached to end the ongoing funding lapse that began Oct. 1, more than 65,000 children in 140 local Head Start programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico will not get their federal grant funding come Nov. 1, according to the National Head Start Association. The federal government spent about $12.3 billion on the program in fiscal 2025.Community programs that receive Head Start funding have different start dates for when their grants are available. Head Start helps fund roughly 1,600 community programs that served more than 790,000 children during the 2023-2024 program year. The program is managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the employees in that agency who would disburse those awards are currently furloughed because of the shutdown.Six programs serving 6,525 children did not receive a grant award Oct. 1 and are already tapping into outside resources and local funds to stay afloat. If the shutdown continues past Friday, another 134 programs that serve 58,627 children will lose federal grant funding. Head Start provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. It is a discretionary program and subject to congressional approval each year, making it particularly vulnerable to the government shutdown. “There’s just so much instability … that this is causing,” Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the advocacy group the National Head Start Association, told States Newsroom. “And while we’re hopeful and we’re going to be doing everything we possibly can to try to minimize the impact directly on children and families, there is going to be a long-term impact, no matter what, that is felt.” Shutdown standoffThe shutdown began Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, when Congress failed to appropriate money for federal programs. Democrats have voted against bills that would temporarily reopen the government as they ask Republicans to negotiate a fix to expiring tax credits for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have refused to negotiate while the government is shut down, leading to an ongoing stalemate.In a statement Monday, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, blamed the impending lack of funds on Democrats. “More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” she wrote.Hilliard added that “the Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government for the American people.”‘Collateral damage’ Sheridan criticized the political landscape that will likely lead to a lack of funding.“I can’t stress enough — this is purely due to politics,” Sheridan said. “This has nothing to do with Head Start not being an effective program or people in Congress and the administration not supporting Head Start.” He pointed to the “strong bipartisan support” the program has received since its launch in 1965. “This is just us being collateral damage in a bigger fight that is going to be hurting working families and children,” Sheridan added. Sheridan noted that “when programs don’t have access to federal resources, generally speaking, they can try, depending on the size of the program, to stay open for a certain period of time, but they’re going to be basically using other funds, and then would be reimbursing those costs down the road, kind of like an accounting maneuver, to be able to keep their programs running.” He added: “That’s why we’re seeing so many programs either close or have to consider closures or things of that kind and why ... we are just urging Congress and the administration to stop having children and families be the collateral damage of a political fight.”Consequences for local Head Start programsFor programs that have to shut down because of the loss of federal funding, Sheridan pointed to several impacts.Children would lose access to healthy meals and other resources. Families would be without affordable child care options, forcing some to quit their jobs or reduce their work hours. Community members could see economic ripple effects if staff who work in Head Start programs lose their paychecks or their jobs. “We also have community partners that we rely on for services, and they rely on us for business — small businesses, contractors, vendors, other small businesses, things like that — but they rely on their Head Start contracts, and if we can’t pay the bills, they’re not going to be able to count on us for what they need as well,” he said. Program already reelingUnder President Donald Trump’s administration, the program was already experiencing chaos prior to the government shutdown, including reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at HHS’ Office of Head Start.That office also told grant recipients in March that it “will not approve the use of federal funding for any training and technical assistance (TTA) or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.” A federal judge in September temporarily blocked the administration’s directive that aimed to prevent immigrants living in the United States illegally from accessing Head Start programs. Meanwhile, Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for maintaining Head Start funding at its prior fiscal year level of roughly $12.3 billion.The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its annual bill to fund HHS, including Head Start, back in July and provided $12.4 billion for the program, a roughly $85 million increase.The corresponding panel in the House also approved its bill to fund HHS in September, aligning with the administration’s request of maintaining funding for Head Start at $12.3 billion in fiscal 2026.  Sheridan pointed out that the program has operated through challenges before, whether natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, or previous government shutdowns. “Our programs are absolutely dedicated, hopeful and are working tirelessly to minimize that impact on children and families, but we cannot operate a program on hope and goodwill alone,” he said. “We need Congress and we need the president to come together to keep our classrooms open and also to ensure that Head Start funding can stay in line with the rising costs that we’ve seen over this last year.”",,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019

(Photo by Lindsey Wasson/Getty Images)Washington’s lands commissioner, Dave Upthegrove, is on a mission to secure $60 million of additional wildfire funding in next year’s legislative session, despite a tightening budget outlook.
On Monday, he and a leading Democratic House lawmaker indicated that they want to tap revenue from the state’s cap-and-trade program for at least some of that money. The maneuver would mean turning to a steady-flowing stream of cash outside the state’s squeezed operating budget.
“Climate Commitment Act dollars are going to be on the table,” said state Rep. Larry Springer, D-Kirkland, who is deputy House majority leader.
At issue is funding provided under a 2021 law known as House Bill 1168, which passed with broad bipartisan support. With that legislation, lawmakers committed to direct $500 million over eight years to wildfire programs. Springer was a lead sponsor.
The HB 1168 funding supports three general areas: initial attacks on wildfires to keep them from growing into huge blazes; forest health measures, like prescribed burns and thinning; and community resilience initiatives focused on making buildings and property less fire-prone.
Legislators largely kept up the funding, with $115 million in the 2023-25 budget and $130 million in the 2021-23 cycle. This year, confronted with a budget deficit, they delivered just $60 million.
The $60 million Upthegrove is now angling for would bring funding in the current two-year budget up to $120 million, on par with the 2021 framework.
But the budget pressures have not subsided, with revenue trailing expectations and lawmakers and the governor preparing for another session rife with difficult budget talks.
It’s against this backdrop that Upthegrove and Springer say that they’ll press for the Climate Commitment Act dollars.
“Although the general fund has a large shortfall, the Climate Commitment Act funding has some capacity,” Upthegrove said.
And spending on proactive wildfire programs, he said, can save money in the long run.
“If we can prevent or reduce the size of one or two large fires, this will more than pay for itself,” Upthegrove added.

Under the Climate Commitment Act, businesses that produce large amounts of air pollution must buy allowances at state-run auctions to compensate for their emissions. The auctions have raised more than $3 billion since they began in early 2023.
Money the law generates is restricted to certain kinds of spending, related to reducing air pollution and environmental projects. There’s a special emphasis under the law on improving air quality and public health in disadvantaged parts of the state.
Reducing wildfire risk and improving forest health are among the eligible uses for the funding.
Before this year, no funding for the HB 1168 fire programs came from the Climate Commitment Act. In the current budget, $20 million of the $60 million in wildfire spending did.
Springer said it’s too early to say how much of the $60 million he and Upthegrove are now pushing for could come from the climate program. 
“That’s going to be through negotiations,” he said.
He makes a case that there’s a clear connection between the climate program and wildfires.
“In terms of the carbon that’s thrown into the air by a wildfire is astronomical,” Springer said. “So there’s the nexus with the Climate Commitment Act that I hope my colleagues will see.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wildfire-smoke-seattle-2020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-27 22:18:06+00:00,Mississippi Today,Food pantry workers in Mississippi brace for Trump’s threat to cut off SNAP on Nov. 1,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/27/food-pantry-workers-in-mississippi-brace-for-trumps-threat-to-cut-off-snap-on-nov-1/,"A decline in funding coupled with a rise in need amid the federal government shutdown is forcing food pantries to constantly pivot to try to fill impossible gaps, workers in Mississippi say.","Cindy Hudnall runs Saints’ Brew Soup Kitchen in Tupelo where she serves hot breakfasts to close to 100 people every weekday – working parents, the elderly, the homeless, veterans and even young adults aging out of the foster care system.
There’s always been a need for people to find enough food to eat in Mississippi, one of the nation’s poorest and most food insecure states. But lately, things are different. Federal money that funded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has dried up due to the government shutdown – so far the second longest in history – and big changes to the program coming down the pipeline are leaving people desperate and scrambling. 
“You can hear it in their voice, you can see it in their face – they are scared,” Hudnall said. “And there’s no magic solution in the foreseeable future. When you get large groups of people who are worried about their livelihoods, you cannot have a thriving community.”
President Donald Trump opted not to tap into emergency funds to continue running the nation’s largest anti-hunger program, according to a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, obtained by Politico. While officials in at least three states have pledged to keep the program going in the absence of federal funds, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced Friday that its SNAP program had been paused. 
“No new SNAP benefits will be issued for November unless federal guidance changes, however, previous benefits will remain accessible,” the department said in a press release Friday. 
That decision promises to leave nearly 400,000 Mississippians without food security, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But it also undermines people’s confidence in elected officials, explained Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit working to end poverty-related hunger. 
“Allowing hunger to deepen during a shutdown is a choice,” Plata-Nino said. “The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority and the responsibility to act now to ensure no one goes hungry because of political gridlock. Further delay in using available funds only weakens public faith in government.”
Nonprofits are having to pick up the slack, which is not sustainable long term, said Jason Martin, executive director of the Northeast Mississippi Hunger Coalition, a network of 24 food pantries across eight counties. 
“I just got off the phone a little bit ago with a woman whose SNAP benefits are not coming through and can’t survive and is requesting emergency boxes,” Martin said. “From the pantries’ perspective, we’re expecting to be overwhelmed with the request for services. And our system is already taxed to the max.”
Food banks have been under enormous pressure since the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut $500 million to their funding in March. The loss of federal funding to food banks coupled with the increasing need is forcing nonprofits to constantly pivot in an effort to fill impossible gaps, Martin said. 
“On a personal note, I just wish that our politicians and legislators would stop politicizing human issues with people who are in a poverty-stricken situation already,” said Martin, who made it clear those were his personal beliefs and not those of his organization. 
While the government shutdown will eventually end and SNAP benefits will resume, they won’t look like they used to. 
How Trump’s megabill will affect Mississippians who rely on food aid
As a result of a historic tax and spending package President Donald Trump signed into law over the summer, the SNAP program will be transformed in two ways. First, enrollees will face immediate new paperwork and eligibility requirements. Cost shifts will also force states to make tough choices about cutting eligibility or benefits further. Altogether, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes the largest cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. 
Mississippians who don’t meet new work requirements could get kicked off SNAP as early as next month, while the state will have to come up with an additional $140 million to keep the program going, according to analysis from the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Georgetown Law School
For the first time ever, states will be forced to cover a portion of the costs for food aid benefits, shifting billions in costs to state budgets. Mississippi, like many other states, will likely have to cut enrollees or benefits or withdraw from the state-federal program altogether. Poverty will increase, local economies will struggle, and food banks will face mounting strain, experts say. As the poorest state in the nation, Mississippi could stand to lose the most. 
“This is one of the most significant impacts on Mississippi’s budget,” said Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center, to a group of lawmakers during a hearing on the federal budget law in September. 
For a number of reasons, states are not equipped to handle this shift, explained Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. The poorest states, that need social safety net programs the most, will be at the biggest disadvantage, she said. 
“Unlike the federal government, states typically cannot deficit spend,” Waxman said. “They have to balance their budgets. And they also have a lot fewer revenue sources – they don’t have access to the federal income tax, for example. Especially a state like Mississippi, which has a historically high poverty rate, there’s just less resources to draw out of the population.”
The most likely scenario is that states that can’t afford their new share of the program’s cost will have to make eligibility changes to cover fewer enrollees. Another option would be to reduce the monetary benefits enrollees get – though Waxman said states would likely need to get waivers, specific authorization from the federal government that allows states flexibility in administering the state-federal program, to do so. 
Both of those options would put an undue burden on food banks and coalitions like the one Martin runs in northeast Mississippi. His small non-profit network must now find new donors and more grants to meet needs that the government once supported.
“As a nonprofit organization we’ll have to figure out how to sustain that level of funding so we can sustain that level of service,” Martin said. “We don’t have a bunch of staff – I’m the staff person.”
The last option would make food aid a thing of the past. 
“The most drastic scenario would be that a state would be unable to support the program and would withdraw,” Waxman said. “And that’s a catastrophic option, but I’ve definitely heard states say that they can’t rule it out because this is a pretty significant escalation in their budget responsibilities and they don’t have a clear path as to how they’re going to meet it.”
“It’s never a simple ‘just do this’ resolution”
Costs to states are expected to increase dramatically in the months ahead. Each state’s share of administrative costs for implementing the program will rise from 50% to 75%. Then, states will be responsible for paying up to 15% of the cost of the actual food benefits – something the federal government used to cover completely. 
How much a state has to pay in benefit costs will depend on its error rates. That rate measures how accurately each state determines if a person is eligible to receive benefits, including SNAP. The Trump administration and Congress enacted this provision to crack down on alleged fraud and abuse. But that has been proven to be rare in the SNAP program, which has one of the most rigorous systems to determine eligibility and payment accuracy among safety net programs, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. 
Errors more often come down to overburdened systems and the fluctuation in poor people’s income, Waxman said.
“It’s often literally just administrative errors, or someone forgot to submit something, or someone’s income was fluctuating frequently and that made it difficult to calculate the correct benefits. It’s not driven by fraud – that’s a very small issue relatively in SNAP.”
Mississippi, a state with an error rate over 10%, would be required to pay the maximum 15% share of benefit costs, explained Lau, from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Shifting costs to states isn’t the only change to SNAP that the federal budget bill imposes. New work requirements will mean that enrollees have to prove they are working, going to school or training at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for one of the exemptions. 
The law increases the upper age limit on the work requirements from 54 to 65-years-old and extends the requirement to those previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and youth aging out of foster care. Caregivers remain exempt, but parents must have children under the age of 14 – down from 18. 
The coverage losses will have a profound impact on local economies, including grocers and retailers in rural areas who stay afloat from the business SNAP recipients bring, explained Plata-Nino, from the Food Research and Action Center. 
“What happens when the SNAP retailer can no longer receive the funds for whatever reason?” asked Plata-Nino. “He still has to pay the rent, there’s no money for rent. He still has to pay salaries, there’s no money for salaries. So, there go the wages, there go the income and federal taxes they would pay, and there go the local taxes. It really is such an ecosystem.”
Research shows that hunger has serious consequences on health and education outcomes. Since children who are enrolled in SNAP or Medicaid are automatically enrolled in free school lunch, the downstream effects of changes to these programs will result in fewer children automatically enrolled in free school-based meal programs. For many children, these meals are the only ones they are guaranteed each school day. 
With constant uncertainty and an increasingly frayed safety net, advocates worry people’s desperation will force them toward options that perpetuate poverty. Charity Bruce Sweet, who leads the Economic Justice Campaign at the Mississippi Center for Justice, said she has seen people get buried under debt after taking out small loans to cover bills or groceries – and worries that will become more common. 
Payday loans, which often accept bad credit and offer same-day funds, typically have exorbitant interest rates that perpetuate poverty. Mississippi has no protections against payday loans and one of the highest average interest rates for them, Bruce Sweet said. Mississippi’s average payday loan interest rate in 2023 was 572%, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. 
“People eventually default on those loans, and they end up in the court system and these attorneys are coming in asking for the loans, plus the interest, plus the late fees, plus the court fees,” said Bruce Sweet. “And it literally will put you in another level of poverty you haven’t even thought of before.”
While it might be easy to judge people or assume solutions, Hudnall, of Saints’ Brew Soup Kitchen, said that working on the ground has opened her eyes to just how many layers are at play when it comes to poverty. 
“It’s never a simple ‘just do this’ resolution,” Hudnall said. “Getting to know people at an individual level will change your perspective about life. You do not know the real story until you ask open-ended questions and get to know people – their background, where they came from, what life was like for them growing up, what scares them and what motivates them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/06154723/3X0A2087-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)The Bank of North Dakota is developing a disaster relief program to help agricultural producers in the state survive the current crisis in the industry. 
The program will work with local banks and credit unions across the state to help ag producers refinance their debt, state officials said during a North Dakota Industrial Commission meeting Monday. 
“We’re looking at a very sizable ag disaster program given what’s going on with interest rates still high, soybean market, low commodity prices, high input costs from the compound of inflation,” said Don Morgan, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota. “We’re hearing from our banks that agriculture producers are under a lot of stress.”

The goal is to create a program that will help farmers and ranchers in the state regardless of whether a federal relief program materializes later this year. 
Morgan said they’ve had conversations with local banks and have come to the conclusion ag producers are going to be in a tough situation even if federal relief is approved by Congress. 
“No matter the amount of money the federal government throws their way, they’re still going to have a very difficult year in 2026,” Morgan said. 
It’s not clear if Congress will approve relief funding, or when, especially as the federal government shutdown continues. That makes planning a relief program at the state level more difficult.

“We’re trying not to duplicate anything the federal government does,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said. 
Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said a little less than 20% of the state’s ag producers “are really going to be hurting” this winter. 
“We’re going to have banks that are going to have to make some really hard decisions,” Goehring said. 
Morgan is having preliminary conversations with legislative leaders to discuss whether lawmakers will want to craft a more extensive relief program for the state’s agriculture industry during a special session planned in the first quarter of next year. 
“We are having those conversations as we build this program,” Morgan said. 
The one silver lining is agriculture land values are being propped up by a diversified set of factors, Morgan said, including agricultural consolidation and out-of-state buyers purchasing ag land in North Dakota. 
“I know that’s contentious, but it’s a reality that is holding land values up,” Morgan said. 
The Industrial Commission, which oversees the state-owned bank, consists of the governor, agriculture commissioner and attorney general.

(Photo courtesy of Larry LaRocco)Former Idaho Democratic Congressman Richard Stallings died at his home in Pocatello on Sunday. He was 85. 
Stallings served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1985 to 1993. He left the House to run for a U.S. Senate position, and lost the 1992 race to then-Boise Mayor Dirk Kempthorne. 
He was then selected by then-President Bill Clinton to serve in the short-lived federal position, U.S. nuclear waste negotiator — a position only held by Stallings and a fellow Idahoan, former Republican state attorney general and lieutenant governor, David Leroy. 
 Stallings represented Idaho for seven years in U.S. House. 

In 1984, Stallings defeated seven-term Republican U.S. Rep. George Hansen by just 133 votes, the Washington Post reported at the time; Hansen had been convicted that year of violating House ethics rules. 
Larry LaRocco met Stallings on the campaign trail just prior to that, in 1982 as both Idaho Democrats were making their first bids for Congress. 
“He was a true public servant, with a deep sense of historical perspective because of his teaching,” LaRocco told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Larry LaRocco
Stallings taught history at Ricks College — now called Brigham Young University–Idaho — from 1969 until he was elected in 1984.
LaRocco joined Stallings in Congress in 1990 and said the Pocatello representative distinguished himself as an expert in agricultural policy. 
“Whether it was dry-land farming on the Palouse, or irrigated farming in southern Idaho, and all the subsidy programs, he actually represented the whole state very well on ag issues,” LaRocco said. “And the people in his district just loved him because of his knowledge of that.” 
Stallings was a moderate Democrat, who was fiscally conservative, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and opposed abortion, LaRocco said. Both men supported labor rights and environmental conservation.
Stallings was also very knowledgeable about water rights issues, which were a particular concern to his eastern Idaho district, LaRocco said. 
LaRocco said the East Idaho congressman had a way of speaking both plainly and eloquently, and catching people off guard with an unexpected sense of humor. 
“He was sort of mild-mannered, and then he’d pop with something that was self-deprecating and really humorous,” LaRocco said.

 Bill Clinton selects Stallings selected as nuclear waste negotiator in 1993 

Following Stallings’ unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, he was selected by Clinton to head an independent federal agency tasked with finding long-term storage of radioactive waste in the U.S. 
The position was created in 1990, when then-President George H. W. Bush nominated Leroy to lead it.
The less-populated Western states were likely placements for the radioactive waste, Leroy said, which is why Idaho officials made sense for the post. As its first nominee, Leroy negotiated with Bush to have the office headquartered in Boise, he said. 
When the Clinton administration took over, Leroy left the post and Stallings was recommended by then-former secretary of the interior and Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus. 
“Mr. Stallings and I worked on a very important project that still needs conclusion,” Leroy said. “We were both faithful to our obligation to work with Congress and with local governments, tribal leaders, with state politicians, and both made some substantial progress until the office was canceled.” 
The office was eliminated in 1995. 
Leroy described Stallings as a “warm, friendly man” who was “very serious, committed to his family, and gave a very full day of hard work to his constituents” during his time in Congress. 
“Their problems were his problems, and he was faithful on a daily basis to doing anything and everything he could to address the needs for the Second District of Idaho,” he said. 
 Stallings led Idaho Democratic Party, served on Pocatello City Council, conducted statewide town halls 

Stallings served on Pocatello City Council in the early 2000s, according to the Idaho State Journal, and chaired the Idaho Democratic Party from 2005 to 2007.

“Richard reminded us that politics at its best is about people, not power,” current Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea said in an emailed statement. “It is about understanding our neighbors’ struggles and standing up for them. His legacy endures in the leaders he inspired, the communities he strengthened, and the countless Idahoans who saw in him what public service should look like: humble, principled, and tireless in pursuit of the common good. Our hearts are with his family and all who loved him.”
Stallings remained involved in politics, and last winter, called LaRocco to ask if he wanted to tour the state hosting in-person town halls to ask questions to Idaho’s current Congressional delegation. The former congressmen were frustrated that Idaho’s U.S. representatives were not hosting their own in-person town halls.   
The events ran late February to May, with 11 in total.  
“It was really great just to be on the trail with him again,” LaRocco said. 
Stallings was in his 80s, and LaRocco said he’d noticed Stallings’ age catching up with him up until the moment he took up the microphone at each event. 
“His political muscle memory just returned, and he just was forceful, he was humorous, he was on top of policy,” LaRocco said. 
The men wrote an open letter to the Congressional delegation, published in the Sun, about the concerns they heard during the events. 
“He was busy to the very end,” LaRocco said, “being a public servant and being out there and sharing his thoughts and policies.”

The IDALS weekly weather report also noted Iowa experienced its first widespread frost during the Oct. 20 through Oct. 26 reporting period. 
Crop progress and condition data, typically shared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is unavailable during the current government shutdown.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the state typically has less than 10% of soybeans left to harvest and less than 25% of corn acres still in the fields by the last week of October. 
“The dry conditions have allowed farmers to push that pace, with farmers in some parts of the state wrapping up harvest and transitioning to other field work,” Naig said in a news release. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan reported Iowa had “unseasonably dry” conditions with a statewide average of just 0.01 inch, while the normal is 0.63 inch. Osage reported the most precipitation, at 0.44 inch, during the reporting period. 
According to the latest map from the U.S. Drought Monitor, dry conditions have continued to spread across portions of the state, with 64% of the state in abnormally dry or moderate drought conditions. 
Glisan said that while Iowa has had unseasonably warm temperatures the past six reporting periods, conditions were “near normal” across most of the state. The average statewide temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit for the period, which is on par with the climatological normal. 
Agronomists with Iowa Soybean Association reported that many farmers are finished with harvest, or nearing the end. According to the latest “walking rows” report from the association, yields have been variable this year due to disease pressure in corn crops and dry harvest conditions that had some impact on soybean weight. 
Farmers urged to plant fall cover crops
As harvest winds down and farmers look to other field work, Naig and Gov. Kim Reynolds urged farmers to plant fall cover crops and participate in the state’s Crop Insurance Discount Program. 
Through the program, farmers can apply for a $5 per acre discount on their crop insurance premiums for the acres they seeded with fall cover crops. 
A news release from IDALS said the program is part of the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which aims to reduce the number of nutrients that end up in Iowa waterways and eventually down to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Cover crops have been a focus of the nutrient reduction strategy and in 2023, farmers planted nearly 4 million acres of cover crops.
“We’ve seen strong interest in our cover crop cost-share programs this summer and fall, and we anticipate just as much enthusiasm for our Crop Insurance Discount Program when the online sign-up opens in December,” Naig said in the release. “This innovative program has been effective in advancing the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy by boosting cover crop adoption while helping farmers reduce their crop insurance costs.” 
Sign up for the program runs from Dec. 1 through Jan. 23. IDALS said farmers can sign up to receive notifications and reminders about the program online. Applications can be submitted at CleanWaterIowa.org or with crop insurance agents. 
This is the ninth year IDALS has offered the cover crop insurance incentive and to date, nearly 2,000 Iowa farmers have enrolled more than 1.4 million acres of cover crops, according to IDALS. 
“This voluntary and innovative program not only encourages cover crop adoption but also offers farmers a discount on their crop insurance premiums,” Reynolds said in the release. “Our farmers understand the connection between soil health and crop production, and know what’s best for the fields they plant.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma County killer is seeking clemency ahead of his scheduled execution.
Tremane Wood, 46, is set to die Nov. 13 by lethal injection at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.
He is set to die for the 2002 stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, 19, during a robbery at an Oklahoma City motel. 
A knife penetrated his heart and lung, according to the medical examiner’s report. Wipf was a migrant farm worker from rural Montana.
The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board on Nov. 5 will consider clemency.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond opposes clemency.
“Wood’s actions on death row in recent years, including distributing drugs and having another inmate viciously beaten, prove that death is the only way to ensure the safety of Oklahomans,” Drummond said.
According to the state’s clemency packet, which included copies of prison disciplinary records, Wood has trafficked in drugs and contraband and solicited violence against other inmates while incarcerated. 
In his clemency packet, Wood says it was his older brother, Zjaiton ‘Jake’ Wood, who killed Wipf. 
Zjaiton Wood received life without the possibility of parole for his role. 
He died in prison in 2019, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.
Tremane Wood also alleges in the packet that his court-appointed attorney was ineffective because he was impaired by an addiction to alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs and did no work other than showing up for court. The attorney died in 2018, according to news reports.
Tremane Wood, a victim of child sexual abuse, is regretful and remorseful for his role, according to the clemency packet.

Gretchen Whitmer’s signature – even though the House failed to present those bills under different leadership before the term expired. The 2-1 […],"Michigan Capitol | Susan J. DemasA split Michigan Court of Appeals on Monday said the Republican-led House of Representatives had a clear duty to present nine Michigan House bills passed during last year’s lame duck session for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature – even though the House failed to present those bills under different leadership before the term expired.
The 2-1 published opinion was written by Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Cameron and was joined by Judge Daniel Korobkin. Judge Christopher Murray dissented. A published opinion is binding on the lower courts and instructive to the Michigan Supreme Court, should the case be appealed.
It is unclear if the House plans to do so.
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), who led the chamber as the plaintiff in Michigan Senate v. Michigan House, said she was pleased with the decision and was happy to see the bills they worked hard to pass last year move closer to the finish line.
“At a time when Republican leaders across the country are breaking the law and getting away with it, this is a particularly meaningful win. No matter how deep our political differences, the Constitution must be followed,” Brinks said in a statement. “Skirting the law is bad enough, but it’s so much worse that they did it in the name of stopping bills that would have helped thousands of their constituents make ends meet.”
A message seeking comment from House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) was not returned at the time of publication.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The bills in question – House Bills 4177, 4665, 4666, 4667 [which passed in the lower chamber in 2023] and House Bills 4900, 4901, 5817, 5818 and 6058 [which were passed by the House in 2024] –  were passed by the Senate during a marathon lame duck session of the upper chamber at the tail end of 2024.
The House, then under Democratic control, was in a state of disarray when state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) joined a mutiny of sorts staged by Hall, who led a GOP walk out and locked up the lower chamber from passing any of the Senate’s bills in the final days of lame duck.
Undeterred, the Democratic-controlled Senate under Brinks pushed on and passed as many of House bills as it could before the clock ran out on the 2024 term. That included the nine bills at the center of the current presentment battle.
When the Senate voted on the bills, it sent them back to the House to enroll them for presentation to the governor. The House under former Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and the House clerk did not complete that task before the end of the term and have never offered an explanation as to why.
Michigan House adjourns after again failing to get a quorum, stranding legislative priorities

That caused a legal controversy over whether the new House, under Hall’s leadership, had an inherent duty to present the bills – which passed both chambers – to Whitmer. Hall’s legal team said it did not have that duty, to which the Senate bristled.
Brinks eventually filed a lawsuit with the Court of Claims, but Judge Sima Patel ultimately ruled for both parties in a confusing decision. Patel’s ruling also landed on the separation of powers doctrine, noting the lower court did not have the authority to tell the legislative branch how to function.
Both sides claimed victory even though the ruling did not grant mandamus relief – or a specific order from the court compelling an elected official to fulfill their duties – and the bills were no closer to Whitmer’s desk and pen.
The House appealed to the Court of Appeals for greater clarity, to which the Senate filed a cross-appeal asking if the lower court had erred when it failed to grant mandamus relief.
In the opinion issued by the Court of Appeals on Monday, Cameron wrote that the House failed to show that the Senate lacked standing to bring the case. He also disagreed with the House in its assertion that the Senate’s legal challenge was unclear enough and unable to seek relief from the court.
Cameron further ruled that the Court of Claims did not commit a legal error when it ruled that the Article IV, Section 33 of the Michigan Constitution enshrines a duty for the Legislature to present all passed bills to the governor.
“The phrasing of this hypothetical indicates an understanding that, after a bill is adopted by both chambers, it becomes the ‘duty’ of the relevant member of the chamber in which the bill originated to present it to the governor,” Cameron wrote. “This understanding supports the interpretation advanced by plaintiffs and adopted by the Court of Claims.”
Cameron added that the mandatory duty was not-session dependent.
“The Legislature, as a whole, bears the duty of presentment. Additionally, the fact that the Constitution does not provide a deadline for presentment is not dispositive,” Cameron wrote. “The discourse at the 1961 Constitutional Convention suggests that presentment is the next, immediate step after a bill is passed by both chambers.”
Michigan Supreme Court orders lower court to decide stalled-bill deadlock

To that end, Cameron ruled that the Court of Claims did commit a legal error when it failed to compel the House to present the bills, deferring to the separation of powers instead.
“While not phrased explicitly, we recognize that defendants raise separation-of-powers concerns with respect to the judiciary compelling legislative action in this case,” Cameron wrote. “As discussed earlier, [the Constitution] contains no language limiting the judiciary’s authority to interpret and enforce its mandates. Absent any such limitations, interpretation and enforcement of this constitutional provision, even in the context of governmental action, falls squarely within the scope of judicial authority.”
Murray said he concurred with the lead opinion in so far as the Legislature’s clear duty to present the bills to the governor. That said, Murray dissented by writing that although the Constitution provides a time period during which the Legislature must present enrolled bills to the governor, that time frame has passed, so there was no constitutional requirement for the bills to be presented now – nor was there any legal remedy that could be granted to the Senate.
The bills in dispute included crucial protections for workers and laborers, including health care affordability measures, pension security and debt collection reforms.
“Today’s ruling from the Court of Appeals is a declaration that the rule of law and state Constitution still matter in Michigan,” Ron Bieber, president of Michigan AFL-CIO, said in a statement. “Three judges, including two Republican appointees, took Speaker Hall to task, ruling that the stalled, pro-worker bills must be presented to the governor. Each day of delay causes real harm to working Michiganders. It’s time for Speaker Hall to stop wasting taxpayer dollars, end his war on workers and present these bills to Governor Whitmer for her signature.”

The new COTS downtown shelter will serve up to 56 people, a major boost to the building’s capacity earlier this year. But it’s still not enough.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
BURLINGTON — As the number of people living outdoors in the Queen City swells and temperatures begin to drop, a new shelter will soon open its doors.
The Committee on Temporary Shelter, better known as COTS, is slated to open an expanded shelter downtown in early November. The organization ran a smaller seasonal shelter at the same location last winter, but has since renovated the space to add more beds and more privacy for guests. 
Yet the couple dozen additional beds are still a drop in the bucket compared to the overwhelming need.
“There are still as many as 300 folks living rough on our streets today, and with winter fast approaching, we feel the urgency of expanding our city’s shelter capacity more than ever,” said Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak at a ribbon cutting event on Monday.
COTS has dramatically transformed the interior of the old Social Security Administration building at 58 Pearl St. Days after acquiring the deed in January, the nonprofit lined up beds inside the former office space to accommodate guests; after the shelter closed in April, construction began in earnest. Now, the shelter features dorm-style sleeping areas, individual bathrooms, a fully-equipped kitchen with cafeteria-style seating, consultation rooms for meetings with caseworkers, laundry and secure storage.

It will also be able to accommodate nearly twice as many guests, with space for up to 56 people 18 years old and up. The shelter will also have six additional spots available for walk-ins on nights when winter weather is particularly harsh, according to Jonathan Farrell, COTS’ executive director.
It will be open only during evening hours; COTS has a daytime center for people experiencing homelessness a few blocks away on North Avenue. People seeking access to the shelter will need to register ahead of time; drop-ins will not typically be welcome. 
The shelter will not be considered “low-barrier,” Farrell said. Guests will be expected to work toward a housing plan with caseworkers, and substances will not be allowed onsite, though “we also work with folks if they happen to slip,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity is preparing to expand its low-barrier shelter on Shelburne Rroad for the winter season, accommodating 30 additional beds.
Yet even as more capacity comes online, Vermont’s largest city still faces a gap between the number of people living outdoors and available shelter space heading into the colder months – especially as stricter rules for accessing the state’s motel voucher program remain in place this winter.
To help bridge the need, the city plans to open additional shelter space during periods of extreme cold, according to Jen Monroe Zakaras, deputy chief of staff for Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak.
COTS’ renovation of the Pearl Street building cost about $1.8 million, according to Farrell. Funding came in part from the state’s Department for Children and Families and a crowdfunding campaign.
The organization plans to move the 36 guests at its current adult shelter on Church Street, where demand has outstripped capacity, to the new location in the coming weeks. It will ramp up to full capacity in early December, Farrell said. COTS then plans to convert the Church Street building into subsidized housing.

Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) toured Aurelius, a nonprofit organization operating a brain health and human performance clinic at Harrisburg University in Harrisburg, PA on Oct. 27, 2025. (John Cole/Capital-Star)As the federal government shutdown reached its 27th day, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) re-upped his calls for the passage of a continuing resolution (CR) and pointed at Democrats for the ongoing stalemate.
“What was proposed was a clean, continuing resolution,” McCormick said Monday to reporters at an event in Harrisburg.
McCormick, along with all of his GOP colleagues in the Senate and a few Democrats, including Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), have voted 12 times for the GOP-backed spending proposal to keep the government open. That proposal has received a majority vote, but not the 60 required to advance it. Republicans make up 53 Senate seats, so they would need Democratic support for the measure to pass.
Republicans hold a majority in the Senate and U.S. House.
The shutdown, McCormick said, is “really starting to hurt Pennsylvanians,” and noted the number  of federal workers that live in the state, as well as the 2 million that rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

“I’m really concerned because SNAP benefits are mostly for folks that are living paycheck to paycheck and really need that support,” McCormick said.
He said he talked with Fetterman late last week about the need to help SNAP recipients. 
On Monday, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers, called on Congress to immediately pass a clean CR and reopen the government.
A few weeks prior, AFGE union leaders joined Democratic elected officials in Philadelphia calling on Republicans to negotiate a deal to end the government shutdown.
Most Democrats have remained adamant that an extension of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which are set to expire at the end of the year, is needed in a spending plan to reopen the government.
McCormick said the proposal that has passed the Senate a dozen times keeps the government funded and adds time to negotiate “whatever extensions should or shouldn’t be” for the ACA, also known as Obamacare.
He noted that he, President Donald Trump, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) are  open to having a conversation about extending those subsidies, but added that it couldn’t happen until the government re-opens.
However, McCormick didn’t say whether he supported extending the premium tax credits from the ACA or not.
“What we’re talking about are the additional subsidies that were put in place during COVID,” McCormick said. “But I am worried about the healthcare costs for people that are living paycheck to paycheck. So, I’m gonna have to see what the options are.”

Fetterman and McCormick support CR, but differ on filibuster
While Fetterman and McCormick have been side-by-side in their support of the GOP-backed CR to fund the government, they are not aligned on if the filibuster should be used to reopen the government.
Fetterman, who advocated for elimination of the filibuster during his 2022 bid for U.S. Senate, told reporters last week that he would support Republicans bypassing the 60 votes needed and approve the plan with a simple majority.
McCormick, however, told reporters that he does not back a proposal for Republicans to abandon the filibuster to pass a spending plan to fund the government.
“And the reason I wouldn’t is because I wouldn’t support that in the case of the Democrats being a majority or the Republicans being in the majority,” McCormick said. “I think once you set the precedent, then you don’t have to check on needing to build some level of bipartisan consensus.”
“I think you’re going to say that you have to live with the consistency on both sides of it,” he added. “In other words, you say whatever your view is on the filibuster, it should be your view regardless of whether you’re in the majority or not.”
McCormick also claimed that “if the roles were reversed” and there was a Democrat in the White House with majorities in both chambers, he would still vote to keep the government open.

McCormick sees path to new trade agreement with Canada, while Trump adds new tariffs
On Saturday, Trump announced that he was increasing tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%. The move was announced following an ad by the province of Ontario that used words from former President Ronald Reagan sharply criticizing tariffs.
McCormick told the Capital-Star on Monday that he has not seen the ad, but added that he supports a trade agenda that is “trying to create fairness for the American worker and reciprocity.”
“And that’s what the president is trying to do,” McCormick said.
He referenced Trump’s trip to Asia and the framework of multiple trade deals with Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia as proof that he has faith in the president over the matter.
“I think there’s a path here to a trade agreement with Canada that’s going to be much more fair to the American worker, but it’s probably going to take a couple iterations, and I’m not going to tell the president how to negotiate,” he added. “I think he’s making some pretty good progress across these deals.”
Some have expressed concern that Trump’s tariff policies have created uncertainty in the market.
McCormick added that he believes that the trade deals that have been made under Trump are a “net good” for Pennsylvania, although he said they aren’t perfect for everybody.
“The sooner we can get these deals done, the better,” McCormick said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-14-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 18:01:31.780589

(Photo by Nelson Chenault via Peacock Group)The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences received a $4 million federal grant to support obstetric care for pregnant people in two rural South Arkansas counties.
Helping Expand Access to Rural maternal health care Transformation for Moms (HEART Moms) will bring “comprehensive, team-based care closer to home” in Ashley and Union counties, Dr. Nirvana Manning, the grant recipient and chair of the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a Monday news release.
The goal of the program is to create “a sustainable, regionally coordinated maternal health network with robust governance, a referral infrastructure and Medicaid-aligned payment strategies,” the news release states.
Another goal of the program is to reduce maternal mortality, measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth. Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
HEART Moms will utilize “a combination of mobile health, digital health and workforce development strategies that we hope can be replicated in other rural areas across Arkansas,” Manning said.
According to the news release, the initiative will start in 2026 and include:

Employing widespread screenings for conditions that increase health risks during pregnancy, such as hypertension and diabetes, and ensuring in-person or virtual follow-up care
Establishing group prenatal care services in the two counties “to enhance prenatal education, peer support and health outcomes”
Training community health workers and mental health specialists on culturally responsive patient outreach, assessments of non-medical determinants of health and assisting patients in choosing and understanding insurance benefits
Improving online access to mental health treatment and local obstetric emergency preparedness

The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The agency awards HEART Moms funding to areas with “urgent gaps in access to obstetric care and perinatal behavioral health” caused by a shortage of health care providers, hospitals closing their labor and delivery units or closing entirely, and long travel distances between providers, among other things, according to the news release.
The Ashley County Medical Center in Crossett is among six Arkansas hospitals that have closed their labor and delivery units since 2020. The hospitals in Bradley and Columbia counties have also ended obstetric services since then. Both counties border Union County, where the South Arkansas Regional Hospital in El Dorado has a labor and delivery unit.
The hospital in Ouachita County, which also borders Union County, is considering scaling back its labor and delivery services in exchange for increased federal funding that will help its doors remain open.
Thirty-one other hospitals in 20 more of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units.
Arkansas postpartum outreach program to expand by end of year

In February, the Arkansas Legislature directed $2.5 million in state funds to the Crossett and El Dorado hospitals so UAMS can train physicians in 22 residency slots, including an obstetrics fellowship. The HEART Moms program will install a second obstetrics fellow in the region.
The program will also employ mobile maternal health clinics that rotate between Ashley and Union counties to reduce patients’ transportation-related barriers to care. A federally-funded mobile maternal health clinic program serves 11 Southwest Arkansas counties, including Columbia and Ouachita, but the program does not stretch all the way across South Arkansas, and its future after 2026 is uncertain.
Earlier this year, UAMS launched the Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health with Manning as director. The center works with providers to increase pregnant and postpartum Arkansans’ access to care, especially in rural and underserved communities.

Burlington School District leaders announced last week that they have reached a major milestone in efforts to reduce racial bias. Data from the last school year indicates that students of color — about 42% of the population — represented only 33% of suspensions across the pre-K-12 school district.
This is a drop from the 2021-2022 school year when students of color – 38% of the population – represented 50% of suspensions in the school district.
The total number of suspensions across the roughly 3,200-student district has also decreased from 248 two years ago to 207 the last school year, according to the release.
The Vermont Agency of Education defines educational equity as the degree of achievement, fairness and opportunity in education as measured by a standard of success. 
While many school districts have adopted equity statements and actions — often not without a fight — many school districts, including Burlington, have struggled to address racial disparities in student outcomes in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation. And cases of persistent racism, harassment and resulting settlements continue to be reported at many school districts.
But addressing disparities in student suspensions disproportionately affecting students of color has been a focus in Burlington for decades, according to district leaders. They point to the connection research has shown between suspensions and difficulties succeeding in and outside of school. 
“When students of the global majority succeed, all students succeed,” said Henri Sparks, the school district’s equity director, referring to students who are Black, Asian, brown, indigenous or of multiple races.
The term “people of the global majority” was coined in 2003 by Rosemary Campbell-Stephens, a British-Jamaican academic. Many racial justice advocates and educators consider it to be a more accurate and inclusive descriptor than terms like “BIPOC,” “ethnic minorities” or “marginalized people.”
Of the 207 suspensions recorded in the 2024-2025 school year, 68 involved students of color, compared to 248 suspensions in 2023-2024 of which 121 involved students of color, according to data shared by the district.
Overall, suspensions have decreased by 17% and, as a result, attendance records have improved. Data shows that 305 student school days were lost to suspensions in 2024-2025 compared to 426 days in 2023-2024. The length of suspensions are also decreasing, with the average days lost per suspension down to 1.47 from 1.72.
Burlington’s restorative code of conduct, revised in 2023, made limiting suspensions to extreme circumstances one of its five major goals. This led to the elimination of automatic suspensions for behaviors like fighting, smoking and vaping, and led staff to foster strong bonds with students and better understand cultural divides. “Because historically, the school suspended a lot of students of the global majority for reasons that they probably should not have been suspended for,” Sparks said.
Burlington’s achievement is noteworthy at a time when diversity, equity and inclusion programs are under attack by the federal government and when districts across Vermont are struggling to continue inclusion efforts.
Sparks said he hopes Burlington will stay above the politics in Washington, D.C., that looks to eradicate equity services and programs. “As we look at all the federal cuts, we still have to figure out … how do we do this work better in spite of all the changes?”

A committed community
Superintendent Flanagan said he came to Burlington because it seemed to be a community that was committed to doing the work to improve student outcomes.
“My core responsibility is to create equity in our system. And the inequities in our system are around discipline and achievement, and those show up as disparities in our data every year,” he said.
The majority of Burlington students, families and staff want to do this anti-racism work, Flanagan said, and that’s what has helped the school district accomplish this win.
Burlington district leaders credit the improvements to multiple ongoing efforts. The district started a summer racial justice academy in 2021 that builds youth leadership and empowers them to make suggestions to the board; created yearlong anti-racist professional learning communities for staff; and offered a series of virtual equity workshops with students panelists exploring issues such as dismantling white supremacy and preventing hazing, harassment and bullying in school.
“What we’re really looking at is really helping our teachers to become more informed of the social emotional needs of our students and how students of the global majority learn differently, participate differently,” said Sparks, who serves on the district leadership team. “First and foremost, they want to succeed, and it’s our responsibility to ensure that they are successful. And if there are barriers, those barriers should not be put in place because of us, the adults in our schools.”
Adults fostering relationships with students and implementing restorative practices and peer mediation have greatly helped lessen or prevent conflicts in school, said Sabrina Westdijk, principal of Burlington High School.
For example, she said, when a group text message chain among students caused harm to someone over a weekend, the anger and resentment could fester and lead to significant conflict in school by Monday morning. Alternatively, students could talk to a trusted staff member and discuss what upset them to diffuse the situation. “And we can actually bring students together and handle it proactively to resolve what turns out was actually really a misunderstanding that escalated,” she said.
That’s very different from how fights, smoking or drug incidents were handled previously — with punitive measures that did nothing to curb underlying issues such as addiction or conflict at home, Sparks said.
When he first started work in the Burlington School District as a student support specialist in the early ’90s, the largest group of immigrants were Vietnamese, and they navigated school with immense difficulty — from being teased and called names to being told they smell and to go back where they came from.
“In my opinion, Vietnamese students and their families were not supported in our schools at all,” he said. 
Sparks said he had honest conversations with school leaders when he joined the district.
“I created the job as I went, based on what I was seeing from students. It was an uphill battle all the way, back then. The high school had three Black people, period,” he said.
Since starting that job, he has helped steer the district’s equity efforts from the creation of an equity council to the implementation of restorative practices and has guided professional development in the form of equity conversations for staff.
But, all in all, Sparks said, it’s been a team effort, with buy-in from the superintendent, the school board to teachers and staff.
“The bigger challenge is making sure we stay on top of it,” Sparks said. “We are doing things to really keep that number where it is, and that means, continuing to push, continuing to help students of the global majority thrive, excel and be included.”
Combating disparities elsewhere
At Winooski, Vermont’s most diverse school district, students of color are the majority: 57% identify as Black, indigenous, and people of color, and 36% receive multilingual services. There, students led the effort to present equity solutions to the board through the Antiracism Steering Committee formed in 2020, to serve as an oversight and implementation body, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria. 
Disparities in suspensions have not been an issue there, said recent graduate Mea Ree Jan, a facilitator of the committee that meets every week. The group’s recommendations, which Winooski School District has followed, include increasing staff diversity, creating ethnic studies and restorative justice solutions, she said.
What stands out in the pre-K-12 Winooski school district — a much smaller district than Burlington’s with about 800 students — is that students have really strong relationships with teachers and staff and with one another.
“They feel like they can go to a teacher if something does happen,” Jan said. “There’s this sense of comfortability that you don’t really see happening in larger school districts.”
Winooski’s approach has been more about creating the system, structures, policies and practices to ensure that it is an anti-racist school district, said Lindsey Halman, executive director of Up with Learning, an education consultancy that works with several school districts to help achieve equity and justice.
South Burlington School District — a larger pre-K-12 school district of about 2,700 students, of which about 30% are students of color — has an equity policy adopted by the school board, similar to Burlington’s, that includes anti-racist professional development for teachers and staff with 25 educators facilitating the work, according to Monica Desrochers, director of diversity, equity, inclusion, anti-racism and social emotional learning.
The district aims for all students to pass assessments, have perfect attendance and no suspensions, but one of the challenges they face in South Burlington is around increasing staff diversity and representation, she said.
South Burlington Interim Superintendent Joe Clark commended Burlington for its success in reducing racial disparities in suspensions.
“We track data regarding racial disparities in discipline and have a robust professional development program to work to eliminate the disparities,” he said. “That is great news out of Burlington. We are not there yet but are continuing this important work.”
While racial disparities persist in South Burlington’s suspension data, “our biggest gaps are between the students who are living with disabilities and students who are living below the poverty line,” Desrochers said.
While efforts to achieve equity continue in the South Burlington School District, Desrochers’ benchmark for success would be for every student, including students of color, to feel “comfortable to be their most authentic self in any space in the building.”
“I want 100% of our students to pass all of their assessments, not be suspended, have perfect attendance,” added Clark. “Short of that, it would be that we should not see gaps in any of those subgroups: racial, impoverished folks, students with disabilities. So until that happens, we’re not going to rest.”

(Screengrab: NCDPI video stream)  The North Carolina State Board of Education on Monday approved a contract with the accounting firm Mauldin & Jenkins LLC to review Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools’ financial practices, after the district reported a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall earlier this year.
The contract, valued at $97,770, calls for Mauldin & Jenkins LLC to examine how the district authorizes spending, tracks purchases, and follows state and federal rules. A report is due by December 31, with a public presentation scheduled for February 15.
State officials ordered the review in September after the district disclosed a roughly $46 million deficit, prompting questions from families and school employees about how the problem went undiscovered for so long. Earlier audits pointed to spending approvals without sufficient budget checks and the use of temporary federal pandemic funds to support permanent staff positions.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) said he supported the board’s decision, calling it “a well thought-out and necessary move.” He added that it was disappointing the local board and administration had not acted sooner, saying the directive had to come from a state agency.
The district’s financial turmoil has led to hundreds of job cuts this year, with assistant principals, support staff and employees in the Exceptional Children’s program among those affected.
A state audit report released in August found the district used temporary COVID-19 relief funds to pay permanent salaries, approved spending without money in the budget and delayed basic account reconciliations. Auditors also flagged misuse of “suspense accounts,” where at one point more than $332 million sat without clear tracking.
While auditors found no fraud, state leaders have said the report revealed years of weak oversight.
During a presentation in September on the state’s new strategic plan, North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction Mo Green also linked the district’s budget crisis to the state’s underfunding of public education. Green noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in the nation for per-pupil education spending, spending thousands less per student than neighbors like Virginia and South Carolina.
When adjusted for regional cost differences, North Carolina’s per-student spending is nearly $5,000 below the national average. The state ranks 49th in “funding effort,” a measure of how much a state spends on education relative to its economic capacity.
“While I think there was certainly mismanagement of resources in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools,” Green said last month, “it also is the case that it’s operated in a situation where we are underfunding our public schools pretty dramatically.”
The district is preparing for a leadership transition, with Dr. Don Phipps set to begin his tenure as superintendent on December 1, succeeding Interim Superintendent Catty Moore.

(Photo courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)A Fargo-based food bank that serves North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota, sent out a plea for donations Monday, urging the public to help it address a rise in food insecurity spurred by the federal government shutdown.
“Ripple effects of the government shutdown are hitting home,” the Great Plains Food Bank said in the announcement. “Federal employees are living without paychecks and SNAP recipients may be forced to find other ways to feed their families.”
The food bank has set a goal of distributing an additional 1 million pounds of food, on top of the 1 million pounds it already sends out every month.
North Dakota SNAP funding in jeopardy with government shutdown

“We are hoping in the next roughly two months or so that we can raise that amount of food and start moving it out the door right now so that we can get that into the hands of our partner pantries,” spokesperson Darby Njos said.
She said while it’s too early to assess the full scope of the impact, the organization is already noticing an increase in demand.
“We’re just in the beginning stages of federal workers missing their first paycheck, and not knowing what’s happening to SNAP,” Njos said.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will be paused Saturday if the federal government is still shut down after Friday.
While the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services has said it has the funds to continue the program, officials last week said the state is unable to load the money onto people’s electronic payment cards.
Some other states, including Louisiana, have announced plans to set aside state money to keep SNAP benefits available to their residents during the shutdown.
More than 57,000 North Dakotans received roughly $9.9 million in SNAP benefits in September. 
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

Njos said the Great Plains Food Bank encourages monetary contributions, but also accepts food donations.
“We are in a special spot as a food bank, we are able to stretch those dollars farther,” she said. “Every dollar that we are able to take in, we’re able to provide two meals to our neighbors in need.”
The Great Plains Food Bank accepts monetary donations online. Those who wish to give food can also learn more on the nonprofit’s website. The most requested items are fruits, vegetables, protein and dairy, Njos said.
The Great Plains Food Bank also encourages North Dakotans to give food directly to their local food pantries, she added.

He was a gentleman in the sense that he was a very gentle man: courtly, kind, and humble. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Bisbee.","Born Oct. 22, 1926
Concord, Massachusetts
Died Oct. 24, 2025
Shelburne, Vermont

John Bisbee died October 24, 2025 shortly after his 99th birthday, at Wake Robin in Shelburne, Vermont. As with all of his beliefs — the importance of family, volunteerism and philanthropy, a women’s right to choose, a song for every occasion, the right to ice cream at least once a day — he advocated for and ultimately embodied the concept of death with dignity as a fundamental right. 
He was a gentleman in the sense that he was a very gentle man: courtly, kind, and humble. His curiosity and kindness showed in his desire to learn everyone’s stories; he meant it when he asked about you and sat with hearing aids firmly in place so he could truly listen.  
He had two homes: Middlesex School, where his father reigned as a stern headmaster, and Fisher Hill, his parents’ farmhouse in Fayston, Vermont, where he spent his summers and eventually moved full time. He married Margaret (Kim) Bisbee with whom he had four children, and later married Brenda Bradley Bisbee, thereby gaining two stepsons. He was educated at Harvard (AB, astronomy) and Case Institute Technology (MS, Astronomy).
As an engineer in the aerospace industry, John developed optical systems for reconnaissance during the Cold War, but refused to work on any weapon-related projects. He then transitioned to space exploration, helping design the first camera that landed on the surface of Mars, and cameras for locating options for the first moon landing. He was very proud of his prowess with the lost art of a slide rule and later spread sheets; to the very end of his life he was analyzing data on the detrimental effects of the abolishment of Roe v. Wade on women. He continued to pursue his passion for woodworking until his late 80s, crafting beautiful furniture and creating unique woodworking jigs.
In retirement he and his wife Brenda volunteered full time. After serving as a hospice visitor for a decade he became a guardian ad litem for the next 29 years, working in the interest of children in court cases in Burlington. Connecting these two areas he commented, “Dying is part of life, but neglecting children should not be.”  On his retirement from that work, he was feted and issued a State proclamation; with his tongue firmly in cheek he noted that his proclamation had nine “whereas” clauses, a number which he then compared to proclamations received by other Wake Robin residents. 
John was predeceased by his wife Brenda Bradley Bisbee and is survived by Michael Bisbee (Sigrid McCabe) of Socorro County, NM; Daniel Bisbee (Connie Bisbee) of Crestview, FL; Alice Bisbee of Hull, MA; Janet Bisbee of Duxbury, VT; Brad Simonds (Morgan Smeraldi) of Sugarloaf Key, FL; Joshua Simonds (Hilary Simonds) of South Burlington VT; 10 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren. 
We are deeply indebted to the staff at Wake Robin who showered him with love and care in his final years. Very few missed his ribbing and virtually all gave as good as they got. Claire, on a daily basis, checked his magnificent lies. Ron, who John dissed for wearing a Yankees baseball cap, finally resorted to posting an official notice in the dining room saying that those wearing Red Sox paraphernalia were not to be served. Others expressed their love with milkshakes and cookies, songs and wordplay, and  always lots and lots of hugs.

Ibrahima spent 40 years enslaved on a Natchez plantation, far from his homeland in Futa Jallon, which is in present-day Guinea. Today, the city now has a historical marker honoring his story.
The marker, unveiled on Oct. 24, sits at the corner of Highway 61 North and Jefferson College Street, near Historic Jefferson College. The Natchez Historical Society approved a donation to buy the marker from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.

Roscoe Barnes III, president of the historical society and the Cultural Heritage & Tourism Manager at Visit Natchez, told Mississippi Today about the significance of Ibrahima’s story. 
“We believed it was time to honor his life and his legacy, to commemorate him for the time that he spent here and the story that he left behind,” Barnes said.
In 1788, the rival group ambushed Prince Ibrahima, who was serving as a colonel in his father’s army, and his men.
They sold him into slavery. He wound up in Natchez, where he spent the next 40 years as an overseer on Thomas Foster’s plantation. He had nine children with an enslaved woman, Isabella.
According to Barnes, the marker is erected at the spot where Ibrahima reunited with Dr. John Coates Cox in 1807. Cox was an Irish doctor who briefly stayed in Futa Jallon, where he met Ibrahima as a child. The pair met at a marketplace in a small community near Natchez. Cox and, later, his son tried unsuccessfully for 20 years to buy Ibrahima’s freedom.
It was Ibrahima’s friendship with newspaper publisher Andrew Marschalk that led him to freedom. Marschalk agreed to help him with a letter to Futa Jallon. 
It took a few years, but Ibrahima wrote the letter and gave it to Marschalk in 1826. Marschalk sent it with a cover letter to  U.S. Sen. Thomas Buck Reed, who sent it to Washington, D.C. From there, it reached the sultan of Morocco who offered to pay for his freedom. Marschalk believed Ibrahima was a Moor from Morocco, and Ibrahima did not correct him.
President John Quincy Adams and U.S. Secretary of State Henry Clay helped negotiate a deal with Foster and the sultan to sell Ibrahima. The deal required Ibrahima to return to Africa. Foster also agreed to sell Ibrahima’s wife, Isabella. 
Before leaving the country, the couple traveled to Washington, where Ibrahima worked with government officials and the American Colonization Society to raise money to free his children. 
Ibrahima and Isabella made it to Liberia in 1866, sponsored by the American Colonization Society. However, Ibrahima became sick and died shortly after arriving of an unrecorded illness. Two of his sons arrived in Liberia the next year, one with his own wife and children. Ibrahima never returned to his homeland.
Barnes described Ibrahima’s story as “one of the most remarkable stories to come out of this area”. Historian and author Terry Alford retold his story in “Prince Among Slaves: The True Story of an African Prince Sold into Slavery in the American South.” That book became the basis for the PBS historical drama “Prince Among Slaves.”
Barnes explained that Ibrahima’s story is a view of slavery in Africa, the United States and southwest Mississippi. 
“It is a story about darkness, a story about pain, suffering, enslavement, but that’s not all. It is a story about hope,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/27132809/Ibrahima-marker.jpg,,,2025-10-27 17:16:40.894649

Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Shari Lee Bents of Royal with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; committing an act that causes physical, emotional or financial injury to a patient; possessing or administering controlled substances without lawful authority; soliciting, borrowing, or misappropriating money or property from a patient, and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the profession.
According to the board, from April 2024 to October 2024, Bents was employed by Stay In Home Care & Medical Staffing in the Storm Lake area. On Oct. 24, 2024, she was charged with first-degree theft and ongoing criminal conduct. Prosecutors alleged Bents took more than $115,000 worth of coins and jewelry from a Stay In Home Care patient and then pawned the items.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On Feb. 15, 2025, Bents agreed to plead guilty to a charge of felony dependent adult abuse and the charges of theft and ongoing criminal conduct were dismissed.
The board alleges Bents admitted to an Iowa Department of Health and Human Services worker that she stole items from her patient on three separate occasions and that she administered morphine to the patient outside of her scope of practice as a caregiver.
Bents’ recent agreement to surrender her license has little practical effect, as she already is incarcerated at the Iowa Correctional Institute for Women where she is serving a five-year sentence on the dependent adult abuse charge.
Iowa Board of Nursing records indicate the board granted Bents a practical nurse’s license in September 2024, months after she first began working at Stay In Home Care. Bents — whose full name is listed in some board records as “Shari-Bents” — faced charges of theft twice in 2016 and twice in 2017. In each of the four cases, the charges were later dismissed.
Other Iowa-licensed nurses recently sanctioned by the board include:
Ragan Victor of Marshalltown, who has surrendered her license on two previous occasions, has again surrendered her license, according to the board. It’s not clear what led to the most recent surrender of the license as board records related to that action have yet to be made public.
According to federal court records, in August 2016, Victor was sentenced to 43 months of imprisonment after pleading guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Prosecutors alleged Victor counted money for a drug-trafficking organization and also distributed significant quantities — specifically, four kilograms — of meth to customers of the organization.
In 2017, while serving her prison sentence, Victor surrendered her nursing license. Court records show that in November 2018, she was transferred from prison to supervised release and, that same year, the Board of Nursing reinstated Victor’s license subject to compliance with several restrictions.
State and federal records show that in 2019, after testing positive for alcohol while on supervised release, and then being arrested on a charge of drunken driving, Victor again surrendered her nursing license and was later convicted of the criminal charge.
In June 2024, the board agreed to reinstate Victor’s license.
Melinda Myers of Palo, who was charged by the board in February with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare. According to the board, Myers recently agreed to surrender her license, although board documents related to that decision have yet to be made public. The board has yet to disclose the allegations that gave rise to the disciplinary charge.
Linda Jay of Clarinda, a licensed practical nurse who in 2024 was charged by the board with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare and with failing to properly assess or report a patient’s change in condition. The board alleged that in 2023, while working at a long-term care facility, Jay failed to notify a physician of a patient’s change in condition, and that in February 2024, Jay failed to document a patient’s condition and improperly administered blood pressure medication.
The case was resolved with a $300 civil penalty and Jay agreeing to complete 30 hours of educational training. The board now says Jay recently agreed to surrender her license as part of this same disciplinary case, although the board has yet to make public any records related to that decision.
Avis Pruismann of Williams, who was charged in January 2025 with engaging in behavior which constitutes unethical conduct, or practices that are harmful or detrimental to the public, by being involved in the unauthorized possession of a controlled substance, and with being unable to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety.
The board alleges that two and a half years ago, in February 2023, Pruismann — board records also spell her last name as “Pruisman” — was criminally charged with possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, in Hamilton County. According to the board, she later entered a guilty plea to the charge and was awarded a deferred judgment.
The board alleges that a recent board hearing on her licensing status, Pruismann “displayed flight of ideas and paranoia while testifying.” In revoking her license, the board found she is “unable to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety by reason of a mental condition” that includes PTSD, paranoia and auditory hallucinations. She can apply for reinstatement of her license in one year.
Jennifer Beltran of West Branch, a registered nurse who has worked in Iowa City, has been issued a warning and had her license placed on probation. Court records show that in May 2025, she entered a guilty plea to the charge of obtaining a prescription drug by deceit, an aggravated misdemeanor, and was sentenced to one year of probation with a deferred judgment that will result in the conviction being expunged from court records after the successful completion of probation.
The criminal charge was based on an allegation that Beltran took six alprazolam tablets, a Schedule IV controlled substance, from University of Iowa Health Care and then took steps to conceal her unauthorized removal of the drug. The Board of Nursing issued Beltran a warning and placed her license on probation for two years.
Troyetta Tralitha Barron of New Hampton, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified facility in Tripoli, Iowa, on Oct. 20, 2024, when she was scheduled to work from 6 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. According to the Board of Nursing, she was seen on surveillance footage leaving the building at 7:18 a.m. and did not return to the building until 8:40 a.m., leaving the facility without a nurse and delaying the morning medication pass. Barron later told investigators when she was out of the building, she was sleeping in her car. After charging Barron with leaving a nursing assignment without ensuring the safety and welfare of the patients, the board agreed to issue Barron a warning and require her to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
Jennifer Kochanowski of Marion, a registered nurse who was employed as a charge nurse at an unspecified Cedar Rapids medical facility on Sept. 19, 2025, when her co-workers noted she appeared to be very drowsy, with an unsteady gait, after working her 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. shift. According to the Board of Nursing, Kochanowski’s co-workers helped her to a conference room and placed her in a chair where she slept for the next six hours. At that point, Kochanowski’s colleagues allegedly helped her to her car, where she fell back asleep, then refused offers to drive her home.
According to the board, a subsequent review of surveillance-camera footage showed Kochanowski pouring what appeared to be medication from a controlled-substance bottle into her water bottle outside the medication room. The board alleges the video also shows that Kochanowski removed medications from the medication room and then took the drugs. The board charged Kochanowski with misappropriating medications, practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and failing to properly document or perform medication wastage. As a part of a settlement agreement with the board, Kochanowski accepted a warning and agreed to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program.
LeAnn McVay of Fontanelle, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified long-term care facility in Avoca between 2022 and 2024 when her employer allegedly received complaints she was dismissing residents’ requests for pain-control medications as drug-seeking behavior. The board alleges an investigation also revealed McVay “communicated unprofessionally with a resident’s family member and with colleagues,” including one incident in which she “threw a bag of feed connectors” at a colleague. The board charged McVay with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum. As part of a settlement agreement on the disciplinary charge, McVay agreed to accept a warning from the board.
Lori Maschoff-Long of Morning Sun, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified long-term care facility in Donnellson on Jan. 29, 2024, when a nursing assistant summoned her to the room of a resident who was unresponsive but had “active, full-code cardiopulmonary resuscitation status,” meaning that life-saving measures were to be taken in such situations.
The board alleged that after finding the resident had no signs of respiration, pulse or blood pressure, Maschoff-Long left the resident’s room and contacted the funeral home and resident’s family to notify them the resident was dead. She later acknowledged she did not know the resident’s CPR status and did not attempt CPR, the board alleged. The board charged Maschoff-Long with committing an act that might have adversely affected the welfare of a patient, then agreed to settle the case with a warning. As part of the settlement, Maschoff-Long agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training in skilled nursing.
Stephanie R. Allen of Burlington, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified long-term care facility in Shenandoah on May 21, 2024, when she was scheduled to work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Within 90 minutes of beginning her shift, she sent a “facilitator,” a text message stating, “I’m done,” and left the building without notifying the other nurses on duty. The board charged Allen with leaving a nursing assignment without ensuring the safety and welfare of patients, and with committing an act that might adversely affect the welfare of patients. The board then agreed to settle the case with a warning. As part of that settlement, Allen agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
Chelsea Rea Crocker of Pleasantville, a registered nurse who was working at the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women in November 2024 when she was assigned to administer medication to an inmate who was in isolation. Crocker charted the medications as given on Nov. 9, however the drugs were not administered, the board alleged. On Nov. 10 and Nov. 11, she charted the medications as “refused” by the inmate, but it was “never documented that she offered the patient the medications,” the board alleged. As a result, the board charged Crocker with failing to accurately assess or report the status of a patient, and with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare. As part of a settlement agreement, the board issued Crocker a warning and ordered her to complete 30 hours of educational training in ethics.
Antoinette Thompson of Pleasant Hill, an advanced registered nurse practitioner who recently agreed not to practice nursing until further order by the board. Earlier this year, the board charged Thompson with eight separate regulatory violations: failing to evaluate, document or report the status of a patient; committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient; being involved in the unauthorized manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs in an unsafe manner; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs without accurately documenting the act or without evaluating the patient; willful or repeated failure to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety, and failure to query and review the Prescription Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing or dispensing of an opioid.
Court records indicate Thompson served as the medical director and nurse for the Live Hydration Spa in Ames until she was terminated when the store closed in September 2024. According to a court petition filed by Live Hydration, Thompson’s termination was based on her “actions resulting in imminent danger to patient health and safety.”
Thompson is currently facing additional charges from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy.
Amy Jo Schmidt of Burlington, who is scheduled to participate in a Dec. 12, 2025, hearing on the board’s recent declaration that it intends to deny her application for a nursing license. The denial is based on what the board describes as Schmidt’s history of criminal convictions, which allegedly includes a felony theft conviction, convictions for possession of illegal substances, and two convictions for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.
Laurie Brockman-Jones of Tiffin, who in December 2024 was charged by the board with unethical conduct for practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. According to the board, Brockman-Jones was employed as a nurse at a ketamine clinic from Feb. 12, 2024, through March 11, 2024. The board alleges that when she arrived for work on March 7, 2024, her coworkers believed she was impaired as she was slurring her words, repeating herself, her eyes were red and glazed, her gait was unsteady, and she appeared disheveled. Brockman-Jones’ supervisor allegedly sent her home and she was fired days later.
A board investigator later concluded Brockman-Jones had prescriptions for duloxetine, busbar, trazadone, and hydroxyzine, and had taken two doses of trazadone the night before the incident at work. According to the board, she admitted she may have been impaired when she arrived for work but did not realize it, and later developed an alcohol problem.
After a hearing on the matter at which Brockman-Jones didn’t appear, the board voted to suspend her license with the understanding it cannot be reinstated until she completes a comprehensive substance abuse and mental health evaluation and establishes it is in the public interest for her license to be reinstated. If her license is reinstated, it will be subject to three years of probationary status.

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Minnesota State Patrol has already bolstered security at the Capitol and is adding 20 more officers to be trained next month, a State Patrol officer told a security panel during a Monday meeting.
Capitol safety is top of mind for many Minnesotans after the June assassinations of Melissa and Mark Hortman and the shootings of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. Additionally, in July a man used a wedge to prop open a door and accessed the Minnesota Capitol after hours.
Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger told the Advisory Committee on Capitol Security Monday that the State Patrol has already added more officers to the Capitol since the July security breach and 20 new Capitol security officers are going through background checks and will begin their training in mid-November.
The State Patrol will also assign a trooper to a new role as a “threat investigator” to cover threats to lawmakers and others who work on the Capitol complex. Geiger said there’s been a rise in threats to people working in the Capitol. In 2024, the State Patrol investigated 19 threats; in the first 10 months of 2025, troopers investigated 50.
This new threat investigator will work directly with the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
The Advisory Committee on Capitol Security has been meeting monthly since the Hortman assassinations, receiving updates from security experts and the National Council on State Legislatures about what Capitol security looks like in other states.
Minnesota is an outlier among states, as the building has no security checkpoints or metal detectors and allows guns on its premises.
Thirty-four states prohibit firearms on Capitol grounds, according to The Council of State Governments, and 37 have metal detectors.
The advisory committee will meet again next month with the goal of creating a list of recommendations for the Legislature to adopt once it reconvenes for its 2026 legislative session in February.

A Vermont man has received a probationary sentence after he admitted to operating an international hacking scheme that stole personal information from tens of thousands of people.
Judge Mary Kay Lanthier ordered Nicholas Moses of Newport to serve four years of probation during a hearing last week in federal court in Rutland. 
Moses had earlier pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors to a federal criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud through the use of computers.

Moses, who used the alias “scrublord,” according to a prosecutor, operated a computer malware program known as SmokeLoader out of servers in the Netherlands and used it “to harvest” data from victims from January 2022 and May 2023, according to court filings. 
“Thousands of computers around the world have been infected with the SmokeLoader malware by Moses and over 65,000 victims have had their personal information and passwords stolen by Moses,” court records stated. 
In an online chat session, according to court records, Moses stated he had sold the credentials and password of victims for $1 to $5 each.
“Moses’s victims, many of whom likely remain oblivious to the theft of their private information, may deal with the consequences of his actions in the form of unexpected and unauthorized charges or stolen and compromised identities for years to come,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugenia Cowles, the prosecutor, wrote in a sentencing document.
Emily Kenyon, a defense attorney for Moses, wrote in her sentencing memo that her client suffered from a troubled childhood and mental health challenges. 
“In the community of hackers Mr. Moses fell in with online, he felt a sense of engagement with a community who shared his interests, and some of his struggles,” Kenyon wrote.
“In this world, unlike in the rest of his life, he was capable of and able to form connections,” Kenyon added. “However, in part fueled by his addiction, mania and impulsiveness, he ultimately made choices that were not consistent with his values.”
The charge against Moses carried a potential maximum sentence of up to five years in prison. 
However, both the prosecutor and the defense attorney stated in their sentencing documents submitted to the judge their support for a probationary sentence in the case, largely citing Moses’ mental health and willingness to quickly admit his guilt.

Owen Bradley-Meal is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
SOUTH BURLINGTON — Over a sunny Friday afternoon on Oct. 10, dozens gathered in the multipurpose room of Faith United Methodist church. At the head of the room stood Nic Longo, director of aviation at Patrick Leahy International Airport (BTV), preparing to tell the story of the past and future of the institution he leads.
About 1.4 million people annually fly in and out of BTV, which is owned and operated by Vermont’s most populous city, Burlington. A joint-use military and civilian airport, it is the state’s busiest airport by a large margin.
Longo’s presentation began with a brief overview of the history of the airport, from the land acquisition in the early 1920s and beginning of commercial service in the 1930s to today. 
By 2008, said Longo, BTV had risen to the status of one of the busiest airports in New England from number of operations. Operations, in aviation terminology, refers to landings and takeoffs. 
Longo then provided an overview of the ongoing construction at the airport, known as the North Expansion Terminal project, which aims to increase the airport’s capacity while keeping it as eco-friendly as possible. 
The new 25,000 square-foot terminal will be almost entirely constructed of timber as opposed to the typical steel. Studies have shown timber to be an environmentally friendly construction material, due to its nature as a carbon sink and the low emissions created in its production, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. 
“Geothermal is going to heat this building, and then of course we’re gonna add solar to the rooftop,” said Longo of other planned environmental initiatives in the new terminal.
“Regardless of what happens to the industry … we’re ready,” said Longo. “Part of that is to make sure we’re sustainable, too.”

The talk also included a discussion of airport finances and partnerships, notably with the Vermont Air National Guard based at the airport, and with Beta Technologies, a designer and manufacturer of electric-powered aircraft.
Partnerships provide important revenue to operate the airport, Longo said. “Our costs are so low. We manage things very, very closely.”
Not all of these partners are welcomed with open arms by the entire community, however. Noise from the National Guard’s F-35 jet fighter squadron at BTV is a source of major controversy. 
“I’ve clocked them at 115 to 117 decibels,” said Ben Bosher, a resident of Burlington’s Lakeside area, who said he hears F-35s flying over his house.  “I’d argue that they should not be doing these kind of maneuvers over populated areas.”
This level of sound is slightly above the official figure provided by the Vermont Department of Health review, which estimates that F-35s have a maximum sound level of 115 decibels. The review also details mixed or inconclusive results in the study of chronic exposure effects of this sound level in terms of hearing loss, cardiovascular effects and more.  
Other concerns were raised by community members during the open Q&A forum at the end of the lecture, including questions about the return of JetBlue service, which ceased on January 5, 2024. This left many people with significant amounts of accumulated points and miles through JetBlue that cannot currently be used at BTV. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity at the airport also generated questions. 
One pressing question concerned the safety and staffing of Burlington International amid reports of no-shows during the government shutdown, which requires air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration employees to continue working without pay. 
Any decrease in staffing would put the airport in a tight situation. BTV operates with a relatively small staff, given the airport’s value to the region, Longo said. “If you think about the $1 billion asset we manage, we [only] have about 55 employees.”
But, he continued, operations are going forward as normal during the shutdown.
“It is still safe to fly,” Longo reassured.
The presentation was a part of a lecture series offered biannually by local organization Education & Enrichment for Everyone, which hosts Friday lectures every fall and spring. The talks are free to EEE members, with an $8 walk-in fee for nonmembers. 
EEE has been in operation since 1990, starting as Elder Enrichment Education, a brainchild of Jim Jackson, director of continuing education of St. Michael’s College at the time. The idea was for an institution to foster opportunities for learning among retirees and soon-to-be retirees. 
Although the official mission has broadened since in accordance with the name change, the principal audience has remained the same. “Most attendees are retired or close,” said Linda Sparks, one of the event organizers, who also reported the organization to have “around 165 members.”
The lectures cover a diverse range of topics and speakers that pertain to a Vermont-based interest, with this fall’s series including talks on Canada-U.S. relations, the Howard Center (a Burlington-based mental health & crisis center), documentary filmmaking and more. 
Each lecture hopes to be unique and fresh. “We try and rotate,” said Sparks. “[We] might have the same speaker every few years, but new topics.”

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A North Dakota environmental group has filed a lawsuit over a giant dairy under construction in Traill County. 
The Dakota Resource Council filed the suit against North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and Riverview ND LLP in Traill and Burleigh counties. 
The Department of Environmental Quality in September approved a permit to Minnesota-based Riverview for a 25,000-cow milking operation southeast of Hillsboro. Crews began moving dirt at the site for what Riverview calls the Herberg Dairy near the Red River earlier this month. 
“Dairies the size of Riverview’s Herberg Dairy create enormous amounts of wastes that contain pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, pathogens, sediments, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, salts, and metals,” the lawsuit says. “When discharged to waters, these pollutants pose serious threats to the health and wellbeing of nearby communities and ecosystems.” 
International commission to review North Dakota dairy projects 

The Herberg Dairy and another 12,500-cow Riverview dairy under construction north of Wahpeton, known as the Abercrombie Dairy, could quadruple the number of dairy cows in the state. North Dakota’s dairy industry has been dwindling for decades. 
The Dakota Resource Council on Oct. 9 also filed a petition asking the Department of Environmental Quality to reconsider its decision to issue the permit for the Herberg Dairy. The petition cited the agency’s failure to consider Riverview’s plans to install a stormwater drain and a drainage system, according to the court document. 
Riverview, which operates several large dairies in western Minnesota, issued a statement last week on the permit reconsideration.
“The permits for our North Dakota dairy farms were approved after careful, science-based reviews by North Dakota regulators, and our dairies are designed and operated to meet or exceed environmental standards,” the statement said. “We’ll continue to listen, learn, and work closely with the community to ensure our dairy farms support local families, create jobs, and contribute positively to the region.” 
Drainage from the dairies also is the topic of another challenge to the projects. 
Three North Dakota residents and a member of the Manitoba Eco-Network are disputing a decision by the North Dakota Department of Water Resources. The agency ruled that drainage ditches at the Riverview sites in Richland and Traill counties do not qualify as drains that would need a state permit. 
The citizens contend the drainage ditches authorized by the state have the potential to pollute the Red River. 
A preconference hearing before an administrative law judge has been scheduled for Friday in that case.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Manitoba environmentalists and the provincial government have taken an interest in the dairies because the Red River flows north into Lake Winnipeg, a major recreational and commercial fishing resource. 
Manitoba announced earlier this month that the International Joint Commission has directed its International Red River Watershed Board to review permits related to the dairy operations.
The Dakota Resource Council filed a lawsuit earlier this year seeking to have the Abercrombie permit revoked. A judge ruled that attorneys for the Dakota Resource Council did not properly serve the Department of Environmental Quality and dismissed the suit. 
The Dakota Resource Council has a different attorney in the suit filed Friday. The lawsuit lists attorneys from Washington, D.C.-based Food and Water Watch and the Wild and Scenic Law Center in Oregon. It also lists Bismarck attorney Sarah Vogel, a former North Dakota agriculture commissioner.

Libraries partnered with Talkspace to provide free mental health sessions each month to adults and teens.
 
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live
In October 2025, Delaware launched a statewide initiative that is transforming public libraries into access points for mental health support, offering free therapy sessions through a partnership with Talkspace, private telehealth rooms, and in-person assistance for residents. The initiative makes Delaware one of the first states in the nation to embed mental health access directly into its public libraries, removing barriers related to cost, transportation, and privacy.
The Delaware Division of Libraries partnered with Talkspace, a licensed online therapy platform, to provide up to two free therapy sessions each month to adults and teens. The service is available for up to six months through September 2026. Talkspace is available to Delaware residents age 18 and older and registration is completed through Hope.Ellsworth@lib.de.us. Sessions are delivered virtually by licensed clinicians on a secure platform, with no insurance or referral required.
Many libraries now offer private telehealth kiosks and rooms where residents can connect to therapy, medical professionals, and other care providers. These secure spaces are designed for individuals who may not have reliable internet access or privacy at home, making it possible for more residents to get the help they need.
Alta M. Porterfield, Statewide Social Innovator at Delaware Libraries, explained that these initiatives reflect a broader mission of community support. “Delaware Libraries support individuals and communities in lifelong learning across all topics, including health and wellness. Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester supported federal funding for Delaware Libraries to provide telehealth opportunities in private kiosks, for Delawareans to connect to care they might not otherwise access. Check out more information at Get Connected – Delaware Libraries and a quick video by the National Network of Medicine (NNLM) .”
In addition to telehealth access and therapy services, the Get Connected program places trained specialists in libraries to assist residents with Medicaid, food benefits, housing support, and job resources. The HEALTH Ready initiative continues to expand wellness offerings, such as health device lending, nutrition classes, and stress reduction workshops.
These innovative services acknowledge a growing community need. Library staff report increased demand from teens seeking confidential mental health care, caregivers looking for support between work shifts, and older adults managing chronic conditions.
Residents can learn more about teletherapy, wellness resources, and community support services through the Division of Libraries website or by visiting a participating branch. Online booking for telehealth spaces is currently being implemented to make scheduling even more convenient for library patrons.
By integrating health access into trusted community spaces, Delaware Libraries are redefining what public service looks like in the twenty-first century. They are not only places to read and learn, but places to heal, connect, and thrive.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_kiosk.png,,,2025-10-27 17:01:14.906323

(DOC photo)The Montana Department of Corrections announced crews have restored full water service at Montana State Prison near Deer Lodge.
Water had previously been restored throughout most of the facility on Friday, with additional worked needed at the High Side 2 facility during the weekend.
“Over the past two weeks, our employees, community partners, and the Montana National Guard kept us operational. All these folks worked hard to get us to where we are today,” said Department of Corrections Director Brian Gootkin. “We have so many people to thank from our maintenance staff, public safety officers, government partners and businesses who jumped in when we needed help. There is still a lot of work to be done but this is a big win.”
Multiple water pipes at the prison broke early this month, which forced the state to truck in water to the prison. Several different agencies have been involved with the continuing response at the facility and the National Guard was called to assist.
The state is using $21 million in appropriated funds to improve water infrastructure at the prison. That funding was passed last session and the timeline on construction has now sped up. 
The Department of Corrections said Sletten Construction, DLR, and the Montana Department of Administration’s Architecture and Engineering team are meeting to establish a construction plan.
Some equipment that had been installed during the water crisis, which has lasted about two weeks, is now being taken down, the agency added.
“As the facility meets water stability goals, the DOC will begin demobilizing assets that were brought in like portable toilets,” the press release stated. “MSP is still under a boil advisory from the Department of Environmental Quality and will continue testing water until it is certified safe for consumption. Inmates still have access to bottled water.”
Inmates were given the boil advisory notice last week, which essentially gave them a warning about issues in the water supply.

Ron DeSantis, CFO Blaise Ingoglia, and Ag Commissioner Wilton Simpson at a Cabinet meeting on Sep. 30, 2025. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)All three members of the Florida Cabinet are questioning the legality of the state voucher system that has steered taxpayer-funded scholarships to private Islamic schools that they contend undermine “Western” values.
Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, all Republicans and allies of the governor, are wondering whether Florida’s universal school voucher system allowing Floridians to attend certain private schools at discounted rates can be properly extended to the Hifz Academy and Bayaan Academy, Islamic schools in Tampa now accepting these scholarships.
The Cabinet, although powerful, lacks authority to set policy or stymie funding from the state to specific schools. That power resides with the Department of Education, which did not respond to a request for comment.
“Sharia law seeks to destroy and supplant the pillars of our republican form of government and is incompatible with the Western tradition,” said Uthmeier, who serves as Florida’s chief legal officer, on social media Monday. “The use of taxpayer-funded school vouchers to promote Sharia law likely contravenes Florida law and undermines our national security.”
However, his office declined to say whether he’d pursue an investigation.
In a statement to the Phoenix, Ingoglia said his office is looking into these schools through an audit.
“We have the ability. We’re already looking into it,” said the Spring Hill Republican, who’s led a statewide program of searching through the finances of local governments for potential “waste, fraud, and abuse.”
Simpson, the former Florida Senate president who championed universal school choice, insisted in a statement to the Phoenix: “Schools that indoctrinate Sharia law should not be a part of our taxpayer-funded school voucher program.”
Of note, Florida’s school voucher program applies to 2,278 private schools, and 82% of participating students attend a religious school. Roman Catholic schools are the single largest religious recipients.
Cabinet members are elected statewide and independent of the governor. DeSantis appointed Uthmeier and Ingoglia earlier this year to fill vacancies.
‘No place in the USA’
This wouldn’t be the first time Florida has nixed voucher funds for schools.
Most recently, DeSantis in 2023 directed the education department to pull voucher funds from schools with alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Before that, the DOE in 2003 dropped voucher funds for Tampa’s Islamic Academy of Florida after two of its affiliates were charged (and later convicted) for terrorism ties.
The Republicans’ push to more closely examine the schools’ finances comes amid a broader push to crack down on Sharia Law, Islam’s legal system, derived from the Quran. This was largely sparked by the Oct. 7 massacre by the Islamic militant group Hamas on Israelis two years ago, which led to a war that has only just begun to wind down.
A Florida member of Congress has since filed a bill to outlaw enforcement of Shari’a Law in American systems, and a state representative months later filed nearly identical language in the Florida Legislature. Neither bill appeared to be based on any example of Sharia law in the U.S., but were described as preventative. Neither measure would apply to school voucher funding.
The governor’s office referred the Phoenix to a post by DeSantis in early October insisting that Sharia law “has no place in the USA” and is “incompatible” with the Constitution, and did not indicate that he would instruct DOE to pull their funding.
The word “Sharia” did not appear on the websites of either Hifz Academy nor Bayaan Academy.
Where did the controversy come from?
The RAIR Foundation, a right-wing media organization dedicated to opposing communism and “Islamic Supremacy,” last week published a lengthy article and two videos claiming that Florida’s school choice vouchers are being used to build “Sharia-run institutions” that “convert public dollars into permanent Islamic infrastructure.”
It pointed to two private Islamic schools in Tampa teaching both Islam and traditional school subjects at the K-12 level that accept school vouchers. Hifz was founded in 2011 and teaches 460 students at a rate of $9,600 per K-6th grader and $10,000 for every 7th-12th grader. Bayaan was founded in 2015 and teaches 200 students at a rate of $12,700 per K-5th grader, $14,700 per 6th-11th grader, and $7,350 per twelfth grader.
The article claims that Bayaan Academy’s principal, Magda Elkadi Saleh, is the daughter of the late Ahmed Elkadi, a founding member of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood. South Florida congressmen earlier this year attempted to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization for allegedly supporting terrorist groups.
Such scholarships for religious schools were first made possible by a 1999 law under then-Gov. Jeb Bush for low-income students searching outside the public school system. In 2023, the Legislature expanded the law to allow any Floridian, regardless of income, to apply for vouchers to go to private schools accepting these scholarships.
According to Step Up For Students, the nonprofit that administers most of the state’s scholarships, Florida’s school choice programs provide an average of between $7,700 and $8,500 to students attending non-public schools. More than 122,000 new students started using vouchers in the 2023-24 school year.
When asked for comment, the Council for American-Islamic Relations referred the Phoenix to a Huffington Post article on RAIR’s founder, Amy Mekelburg, documenting her controversial past; this includes calling former President Barack Obama a “jihadist,” attempting to free a man convicted of killing his girlfriend, and encouraging readers to follow a man known to praise Adolf Hitler.
Step Up for Students has yet to get back to the Phoenix about how much money the Tampa schools received from the student voucher programs.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 20:26:02+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT towing companies, consumer advocates at odds over legislative proposals",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/towing-companies-consumer-advocates-working-group/,Advocates and business owners are developing recommendations to the CT legislature as part of a working group formed under a 2025 law.,"Towing companies and consumer advocates presented disparate visions for Connecticut’s towing regulations at a state Department of Motor Vehicles working group meeting Monday, highlighting challenges as the group tries to agree on recommendations to the legislature.
The 10-member committee was formed under a 2025 law that overhauled much of the state’s towing law and went into effect Oct. 1. The law passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support last session following reporting from The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that found that Connecticut allows tow truck companies to start the sales process in 15 days on cars valued under $1,500 — one of the shortest windows in the country. The stories also explained how this and other laws favored towing companies at the expense of low-income residents.
The towing working group had its second meeting Monday at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Wethersfield. It has until February to address the problems that remain with towing procedures in Connecticut.
“How do we help an individual without killing [towing companies] in regards to the fees?” DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera said at the meeting.
Towing company representatives said Monday they need to be sure they can make money and recoup the costs of towing and storage. They proposed ridding state law of the current valuation system that sets different requirements for cars worth $1,500 or less and holding all cars for 30 days, regardless of the value.
Consumer advocates in the group presented a plan that they said would maximize the chances that people who want their vehicles back can retrieve them. Their plan would halt storage charges for vehicle owners who notify the tower that they plan to pay towing fees and get their cars.
Rafie Podolsky, an attorney at Connecticut Legal Services and committee member, said he sees the sales process as two parts. First, there’s the time after a vehicle is towed when the owner can get it back from the towing company. Second, if the owner doesn’t retrieve their car it is sold.
Consumer advocates want to establish a procedure within the DMV so vehicle owners can dispute tows from private property as opposed to tows after accidents. The plan would require that towers stop charging storage fees for 10 to 20 days if the vehicle owner says they want the car back.
They also want to require towers to keep an itemized list of the personal items in the vehicle and ban them from driving the cars for their own purposes. Previous reporting from CT Mirror and ProPublica found that some tow companies used personal possessions as leverage to get people to pay towing and storage fees. The proposal would also have the DMV keep and report out data on towing and sales.

“The problem always is that as time goes by” costs go up, Podolsky said.
Towers in the group said Podolsky’s plan wouldn’t work.
“We’ve still got to make money,” Eileen Colonese, secretary of the Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, muttered during Podolsky’s explanation.
Colonese, of Farmington Motor Sports, said under the consumer advocates’ proposal, towing companies would essentially be storing vehicles for free.
Towing companies presented a legislative proposal that would do away with the valuation system for towed vehicles in Connecticut. Under the new law, cars worth $1,500 or less can be sold in 30 days in a private sale. Vehicles worth more than that can be sold within 45 days and it must be at a private auction.
The towers’ proposal instead says that all vehicles could be sold after 30 days, regardless of value or condition. Sales of vehicles five years old or newer would have to be advertised in the newspaper, and older vehicles would require only certified mail to the owner.
“We put together a streamlined system,” said Sal Sena, legislative chair of the towing association and owner of Sena Brothers. “We tried to create a concurrent system and then streamline it in 30 days.”
Podolsky said the towing companies’ proposal takes a process that’s “not working” and applies it to everybody.
Guerrera said deciding on a proposal would be a tough balancing act.
“How do we make it easier for the consumer to get their vehicle back? And I think that’s beneficial for you guys too, right?” he asked, gesturing to the towers who had previously said they didn’t want to keep people’s cars; they just wanted to be paid.
“I think our time is going to start to get pretty tight,” Guerrera added, of the legislative deadline.
State law mandates that the committee present recommendations to lawmakers by Feb. 1. The group plans to meet once per month, leaving likely three more meetings until the recommendations are due.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 20:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT will bolster heat assistance program as federal funds stall,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/ct-liheap-energy-assistance/,"Replacing LIHEAP funds with state money will cost Connecticut millions monthly, though the state can seek federal reimbursement after the shutdown.","While thousands of Connecticut households stand to lose federal nutrition aid in the coming days, key energy assistance grants — also imperiled by the federal shutdown — will be paid out temporarily with state dollars.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration announced late last week the state would supplant vanishing federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds with dollars from the state’s common cash pool for the duration of the shutdown.
This likely will cost Connecticut millions of dollars monthly, though Lamont’s budget office says the state can seek reimbursement from Washington once the federal funding crisis has been resolved.
“We do live in New England, we have cold weather, and people do need their heat kept on,” said Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee.
Leaders of the state’s Low Income Energy Water Advisory Board praised the administration for intervening in a program that otherwise would face a funding crisis as soon as next week.
“It’s a relief to hear that the administration is taking a proactive approach to making sure that needy households get the assistance they need,” said Nora Duncan, vice chair of the advisory board and AARP’s Connecticut director.
Claire Coleman, Connecticut’s consumer counsel and chairwoman of the advisory board, called the Lamont administration’s decision “a positive step” and said she fears stalled federal funding for nutrition aid and other social programs could trigger even greater demand for energy assistance, which already is projected to rise.
Many households may need “to triage bills in a certain order,” choosing between paying rent, grocery and heating bills depending on available resources, Coleman added.
Though known as the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, or CEAP, the state’s chief winter heating aid service is funded almost entirely using federal LIHEAP grants.
The state Department of Social Services projected last August that more than 100,375 households would need heating assistance this winter, up more than 12% from one year ago. The program serves households earning 60% or less of the statewide median income, which is $91,854 for a family of four.
Projected spending for this winter’s program is up 3%, from $86.4 million to $89.2 million.
The federal LIHEAP contribution for this winter remains flat at $81.7 million. The rest of the program budget largely is supported with unspent money left over from last winter’s assistance.
When the federal shutdown began Oct. 1, stalling new LIHEAP funding, Lamont administration officials said those surplus dollars from last winter would be sufficient to fund processing of applications and other administrative costs through October. But once benefits start being issued Nov. 3, the program would be in trouble.
Basic benefits this winter for “non-vulnerable households” would range from $295 to $595. For vulnerable households — which are categorized as any household with a member who is 60 or older, has a disability, or has a child that under age 6 — benefits would range from $345 to $645.
The program also provides as many as three “crisis assistance” payments of $425 each for certain households that rely on deliverable fuels, such as home heating oil, and that have exhausted their basic benefit grants.
The Connecticut Energy Assistance Program spends most of its budget between Nov. 1 and April 30, an average of about $14 million to $15 million per month.
But the state likely won’t be advancing the program that much money from its own coffers.
Collibee said Connecticut only would advance funds to cover CEAP benefits for households that use fuels typically supplied by non-utility commercial distributors, such as home heating oil.
Customers who rely on electricity or natural gas from a licensed utility cannot be removed from service, even if a bill hasn’t been paid, from Nov. 1 through April 30.
But these households still may struggle to pay large backlogged bills next spring, once the shutoff-protection period has ended, without CEAP assistance.
The energy advisory board has been urging state officials in recent years — as federal LIHEAP funding has not kept pace with surging demand — to invest more state dollars to keep vulnerable households warm.
Connecticut has amassed huge state budget surpluses, averaging more than $1.8 billion per year or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, since 2017. Most of those dollars have been used to build state budget reserves and to whittle down Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
But with ongoing cutbacks in federal assistance programs taking effect next year and in 2027, state officials need to reconsider their general reluctance to fund energy assistance more, said Coleman and advisory board member Chris Herb, president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.
The hundreds of fuel oil delivery companies represented by CEMA wrote to state officials recently also urging them to keep the winter heating program afloat during the federal shutdown and protect vulnerable households,
“This is matter of their safety and health,” Herb said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_0916_SR_HeatingAssistance_101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 17:01:14.906323

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A week before the Democratic primary in the special election to fill the Providence City Council’s vacant Ward 2 seat, a candidate forum scheduled for Tuesday night will give voters another chance to evaluate the candidates.
The forum on Tuesday from 7 to 9 p.m. at Temple Beth-El, 70 Orchard Ave., Providence, is the third so far in the special election cycle, and will be hosted by the temple and the Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island. Previous forums were hosted by Brown University and the College Hill Neighborhood Association. 
The Democratic primary is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 4. The special election will take place on Tuesday, Dec. 2.
Ward 2 spans Providence’s East Side neighborhoods of Blackstone, College Hill and Wayland, which ranks among the capital city’s wealthiest sections in terms of median income.  
The special election was triggered by the resignation of former Councilor Helen Anthony in early September. Anthony cited her continued recovery from injuries she received in a serious accident during a 2023 trip to California. Anthony was first elected in 2019 and chaired the council’s Committee on Finance.  
The forum will feature all four Democratic candidates and the one Republican running.
Campaign finance records show Democrat Matt McDermott raised $33,530, the most of any candidate, and had spent $17,086 as of Oct. 13. McDermott is a Democratic pollster who has served as national co-chair of the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund Campaign Board and worked with U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride on her campaign. McDermott cited his top campaign priorities as expanding affordable housing and returning Providence schools to local control as some of his top campaign priorities.
Democrat David Caldwell Jr. raised $2,600 and loaned his campaign $30,000, according to campaign finance records. He spent $31,097 as of Oct. 13. Caldwell is the president of the Audubon Society of RI and a Marine Corps veteran. His priorities include returning Providence’s public schools, which are currently under state control, to municipal control, as well as climate change and affordable housing.
Democrat Jill Davidson raised $26,105 and had spent $9,175 as of Oct. 13. She is the director of development and communications at the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, and longtime organizer in education-related issues in the city. Davidson was involved in stopping the closure of Nathan Bishop Middle School. Ward 2’s former officeholder Anthony and state Sen. Sam Zurier jointly endorsed Davidson on Oct.17.
Democrat Jeff Levy raised $18,784 and spent $3,711 as of Oct. 13. He is a principal attorney of the law firm Levy & Blackman LLP and has lived on the East Side for 27 years. Levy writes on his website that he will seek “find fair and equitable solutions to the budget, schools, and housing” and defend the city against what he calls “the looming MAGA assault.”
Republican Axel Brito has not yet reported raising any money for his campaign. The 21-year old Brown University senior, who is pursuing a Masters degree in teaching, cited education policy, property taxes, rent hikes and fiscal responsibility as his biggest concerns in a recent interview with WPRI.

(Photo by Lara Cerri, used by permission)BRADENTON — State lawmakers representing Manatee County heard harsh criticism on Monday regarding a law that critics maintain blocks local governments from regulating development now and for years to come.
Senate Bill 180 received nearly unanimous approval from the state Legislature this spring and was signed into law this summer by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Nick DiCeglie, R-Pinellas County, was intended to help people rebuild properties damaged by major storms. But its language was altered substantially by several provisions that has led to two lawsuits being filed to block it in state court.
Among those provisions is Section 18, which freezes cities and counties from adopting land-use regulations deemed “more restrictive or burdensome” than those in place before recent or future hurricanes. Section 28, which says that the new land-use laws apply in counties listed in the federal disaster declaration for hurricanes Debby, Helene, or Milton plus “each municipality within one of those counties.” It covers every part of the state retroactively from August 2024 and prospectively through October 2027.

While several lawmakers have already said they intend to file legislation to repeal those provisions next year, Manatee County citizens told a group of state lawmakers representing them in the Florida Legislature on Monday — GOP State Sen. Jim Boyd and GOP Reps. Will Robinson, Michael Owen and Bill Conerly — that they need to make that a priority when they return to Tallahassee for the 2026 regular session on Jan. 13.
Wetland protections delayed because of law
The issue is of particular sensitivity for Manatee County residents, because the new law comes after several new commissioners were elected in 2024 who supported putting wetland restrictions back in place that had been overturned by a previous board. However, due to concerns about potentially violating SB 180, county commissioners delayed voting to revert to the county’s previous and more restrictive wetland buffering regulations after they received a warning letter from the Florida Commerce Department.
“Senate Bill 180 was the ultimate betrayal for our Manatee County — you knew that last year [when] this community sent a loud and unifying message,” said Joe McClash, a Republican who served on the commission from 1990 to 2012. “They voted for restoring wetland protection, and you as our senator, Jim Boyd, you really betrayed us with the passage of Senate bill 180.”
“I don’t feel like I betrayed the community,” said Boyd, who will become the Senate President in the fall of 2026. “I’m sorry you feel that way, Mr. McClash. I never once heard from you on this issue. Happy to talk with you about it. I never once heard from you. I think you’ve heard all of us say, there were some issues with Senate Bill 180 that we’re going to try to fix.”
McClash said the original intent of the bill was good but it had “spiralled” into an anti-local government law that “was really the death blow to governing our local communities.”
He added: “Republicans used to be for the best government is closest to the people,” he said. “We need to get back to that … and stop approving these bills aimed at removing local decisions.”
Commissioner George Kruse, also a Republican, said “95%” of SB 180 was “an amazing” and a “thoughtful bill” law provides “tremendous benefits for the citizens,” but that in fact the legislation as ultimately written was “preventing municipalities from being thoughtful of future growth.”
“We want you to restore the will of the people!” demanded Kevin Wright, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and member of the Manatee County Republican Liberty Caucus. “Right now, in Manatee County, our board of county commissioners cannot do what we the people elected them to do. Why? Because of the vague language contained in SB 180. It’s an easy fix.”
Lawsuits
The commission has joined two dozen local governments in filing a lawsuit in a state trial court in Leon County seeking to block SB 180. The complaint lists allegations of how local governments have been “impacted” and “damaged” by SB 180. In the case of Manatee County, it refers to how local officials received letters from the Florida Department of Commerce earlier this year alleging that certain planning and zoning regulations proposed in the county were in direct conflict of Section 28 of the law.
“The letter states the proposed ordinances may be violative of Section 28 for being a ‘restrictive or burdensome’ procedure for obtaining a development permit after a disaster — without purporting to identify what it was more restrictive or burdensome than, or to whom it was more restrictive or burdensome,” the complaint reads.
A second lawsuit has been filed attempting to block provisions of the bill by the smart-growth group 1000 Friends of Florida on behalf of an Orange County resident.
Haley Busch, communications and outreach director for the group, told lawmakers that sections 18 and 28 of SB 180 “undermine every other local priority that Floridians and Manatee County residents care about.”
“When a region like Manatee is growing so fast, when communities need to tackle flooding, drainage, align new development with existing infrastructure capacity, improve road-based safety or plan for their housing needs, they do it through updates of their comprehensive plan and land development codes,” she said. “Those sections 8 and 28 freezes those updates for three years or more and invite lawsuits over anything deemed ‘more restrictive or burdensome’ is quite vague language.”
DiCeglie has said on several occasions over the past few months that he is prepared to “make some adjustments” to the legislation when lawmakers return to Tallahassee. Boyd said he has spoken with DiCeglie and the bill’s House sponsor, Rep. Fiona McFarland, R-Sarasota, and said they both feel if there’s a way to “tweak” the legislation, “we certainly will.”
But Boyd insisted that the intention of the bill was never to thwart local communities.
“Along the way it was made to look like this was jammed down communities — not just Manatee County, but others around the state — down their throats, intentionally. And it wasn’t,” he said. “It was something to try to protect residents and citizens and more importantly help them get back into their homes and properties after such significant storms now and in the future.”

The lawyer and solar developer at the center of controversial solar plans in Bennington rebuffed the misconduct claims and requested relief from the Vermont Supreme Court.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Solar developer faces Vermont professional misconduct investigation over alleged legal practices.","Thomas Melone, a lawyer and solar developer, is facing a professional misconduct probe and potential disciplinary actions before Vermont’s Professional Responsibility Program due to the alleged legal tactics he used in his attempts to gain approval for two solar projects in Bennington.
In a response last Thursday, Melone rejected the claims, and requested the Vermont Supreme Court cancel the misconduct complaint against him.
Melone has been locked in a legal battle spanning a dozen years to erect adjacent solar field projects on a forested 27-acre plot in Bennington. The solar plans have drawn the ire of residents in the area who have cited concerns with deforestation, noise pollution, increased wind, visual and aesthetic impacts and lack of compliance with the town plan. 
President of Connecticut-based solar firm Allco Renewable Energy, Melone is known for a hawkish legal strategy, suing Vermont regulators, the town of Bennington, local citizens and even Gov. Phil Scott, according to Vermont Public. 
Repeat denials by the Public Utility Commission for approval have not dissuaded Melone from his goal, as he has continued to bring forward the two solar projects with modified plans before the regulatory body since his first attempts in 2013. 
Even after Melone gained approval for one of his projects, the Vermont Supreme Court sent the solar projects back to the commission for approval on appeal in 2019, siding with Bennington residents that both projects needed to comply with the town plan.
But, in June, the town of Bennington entered an agreement with the solar developer, agreeing to consider the location a “preferred site” for the two solar projects and direct the planning commission to consider rezoning the area, among other conditions. 
This came after a suit Melone filed against the town jeopardized the funding timeline and viability of a major revitalization effort called the Bennington High Project.
The Bennington Select Board authorized the town to enter a contract with local developer Zak Hale under Hale Resources LLC, in January to transform the former Bennington High School building into community hub and affordable housing units. The project has also been a source of contention in town due residents’ and some select board members’ concerns with the grant funding model.

The alleged misconduct
In a Sept. 26 petition, White River Junction lawyer Michael Hanley levied eight counts against Melone for violations of the Vermont Rules of Professional Conduct. Hanley declined to comment on the ongoing matter last week. 
In February, Melone appealed the town’s Bennington High School project contract decision to the Vermont Superior Court’s Environmental Division, but the challenge was dismissed due to lack of subject jurisdiction. Melone then appealed the dismissal to the Vermont Supreme Court, even though he “knew, or should have known” the Environmental Division did not hold jurisdiction on the matter, according to the petition. 
The solar developer also filed a civil lawsuit against Bennington, asserting the Bennington High Project contract was “municipal waste,” according to the petition.
Knowing the Bennington High School Project was a priority for the town, Melone, and his son and lawyer Michael Melone, allegedly told town officials they would drop the suits if the town withdrew opposition to one of the solar project proposals before the Public Utility Commission, Hanley wrote.
In January, Melone allegedly also told the Public Utility Commission that five of the seven Bennington select board members were engaged in a “cover-up conspiracy,” forgery, counterfeiting, and had submitted false statements to the commission and state and federal government, according to the petition.
Melone reported to the Public Utility Commission that he planned to file a lawsuit against Bennington for violations of the Racketeer, Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which he never executed, according to the petition. The developer also allegedly told the commission that town attorney Merrill Bent violated Vermont and New York professional conduct rules, but did not inform the Professional Responsibility Program of the allegation, according to the petition. 
In March, Bent submitted another petition alleging Thomas Melone and Michael Melone violated Vermont’s professional misconduct code. The complaint was referred for potential “disciplinary actions,” the petition read.
According to the petition, Melone responded by telling the Professional Responsibility Program’s screening counsel that Bent’s allegations were meritless but “actionable offenses,” asserting falsely she could be liable for a defamation lawsuit. Melone also allegedly asserted without basis that Bent treated at least one employee improperly, but never filed a petition with the Professional Responsibility Program against Bent.
In April, Melone also allegedly emailed town officials and the select board, accusing the town of defamation, and denied Bent’s request to stop direct communication with her clients.
Bent declined to comment last week on behalf of the town or on the petition she filed in her individual professional capacity.
In 2024, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld a Commission imposed $5,000 fine against Melone’s companies for violating a temporary restraining order that barred Melone from starting site cleanup at the proposed solar project location before a Certificate of Public Good could be awarded by the Public Utility Commission, according to the petition.
According to a Vermont Supreme Court ruling cited in the petition, Melone’s failure to observe the commission’s regulatory requirements damaged the “credibility and integrity of the process, resulting in harm to statutory scheme and potential harm to public safety and welfare, the environment and utility customers.” 
Two opponents to the solar projects — identified as ML and DG in the suit — filed for bankruptcy, and Melone allegedly wrote to them in May stating he had found undeclared property in their bankruptcy documents.
In November 2024, Melone wrote that the only way to resolve “lingering issues” was for the ML and DG to write letters of support for the two solar projects to the Public Utility Commission and Bennington’s planning commission and select board, according to the petition. 
After the duo did not send letters, Melone allegedly accused ML and DG of “defrauding the federal government” in comments to the Public Utility Commission. 
In an March email to energy-related legislative committee members, the developer also accused Public Utility Commission Chair Brendan McNamara of weaponizing the “single-plant rule” to the detriment of his application for a Certificate of Public Good for his solar project plans. The two abutting solar fields, if considered together, would exceed the commission’s regulations for a single plant. 
The Commission ruled in June of this year that Melone had engaged in “ex parte communications” in his email communications with McNamara, but no sanctions were imposed. 
In the petition, Hanley wrote that the incidents in which Melone allegedly violated professional conduct shows a “consistent pattern” of intentional misconduct.

Melone’s response
Melone has since filed a complaint on Thursday for extraordinary relief before the Vermont Supreme Court, asserting the professional misconduct petition against him is “fatally flawed.” 
Melone’s complaint comes past the typical timeframe for a response, and a lack of a timely reply means that Melone’s denial of the facts and charges may no longer hold legal sway, according to Hanely’s petition. 
Melone’s original request to extend the 20 day deadline for response to Oct. 16 was accepted. Melone’s second request to extend the response time to Oct. 27 was not responded to before he submitted the complaint for extraordinary relief before the Vermont Supreme Court last Thursday, Oct. 23. 
Melone wrote Hanley was invalidly appointed to the role of disciplinary counsel and extensive allegations were all meritless and are not within the jurisdiction of the Professional Responsibility Board to litigate. 
According to Melone’s complaint, Bent asserted that Melone’s “behavior is not normal” in her original filing with the Vermont Professional Responsibility Program. In response, Melone wrote in his complaint that frequent litigation and criticism may not be “normal” for Vermont’s legal community, but his actions have sound legal backing. 
Melone wrote the petition employed “shotgun or puzzle pleading lacking the clarity required by due process,” which is a legal tactic of extensively quoting defendants and piling on false or misleading arguments. 
The ultimate aim of the professional misconduct petition was to target and “unlawfully chill the future exercise of his First Amendment rights,” Melone wrote.

,DC,2025-10-27 20:06:05+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/upcoming-federal-food-assistance-pause-intensifies-shutdown-fight,,"WASHINGTON — The stakes of the ongoing government shutdown rose Monday as the U.S. Department of Agriculture doubled down on its position that food benefits for November could not be paid and a union for federal workers implored lawmakers to pass a stopgap measure.As the government shutdown entered day 27, President Donald Trump’s administration sought to add pressure on U.S. Senate Democrats to approve the House Republicans’ stopgap government funding bill by refusing to use USDA resources to stretch critical food assistance benefits to the most vulnerable Americans. USDA confirmed over the weekend it will not follow its own contingency plan — which the department has removed from its website — to tap into its multi-year contingency fund to cover food assistance for more than 42 million people for November. The department also pinned a fiery message to its website blaming Democrats for the lapse in benefits and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson called on Democrats to approve a stopgap funding measure to restore food assistance.Democrats have voted against the GOP short-term spending bill to draw attention to and force negotiations on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” according to the banner across USDA’s website. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 1. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.”The banner falsely indicated that Democrats’ sole goal was to provide health insurance to immigrants in the country without legal authorization and transgender patients.Reversal on SNAP contingencyBut the move represents a reversal from the administration's own policy, laid out in a Sept. 30 contingency plan on the eve of the shutdown that States Newsroom reported Friday. The plan detailed how the agency would use the contingency fund provided by Congress to continue benefits. The fund holds roughly $6 billion, about two-thirds of a month of SNAP benefits, meaning USDA would still have to reshuffle an additional $3 billion to cover the remainder for November.Hundreds of Democratic lawmakers, and the top Senate Republican appropriator, Susan Collins of Maine, have pressed USDA to use its contingency fund. Democrats, such as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, have also criticized the Trump administration for refusing to use its resources, despite the contradiction in its own Sept. 30 contingency plan and its shuffling of funds for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC.“We know that Trump has the resources to continue SNAP and other programs like WIC,” Booker said. “Weaponizing food assistance is, simply put, a new and disgusting low.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed that sentiment in a floor speech Monday.“The administration is making an intentional choice not to fund SNAP this weekend,” the New York Democrat said. “The emergency funding is there. The administration is just choosing not to use it.”USDA did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Millions of vulnerable people, such those who have low incomes or are living with disabilities, rely on SNAP. About 40% of SNAP recipients are children 17 and younger.   Union calls for stopgapAnother form of pressure on Democrats arrived Monday with the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, calling for lawmakers to strike a deal to reopen the government.  As the shutdown nears a month, most of the roughly 2 million civilian federal workers have already missed paychecks. The AFGE is typically more politically aligned with Democrats and had held off on publicly weighing in in favor of a stopgap until Monday when Everett Kelley, the union’s president, called for Congress to end the government shutdown and pass a continuing resolution to resume funding.“Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren’t looking for partisan spin,” Kelley said in the statement. “They’re looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they’re being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.” Johnson added that he hopes the recent statement from the union representing 800,000 federal workers pushes Senate Democrats to approve the House’s stopgap.“They understand the reality of this,” he said. Johnson defends USDA moveJohnson defended USDA’s decision not to use its contingency fund for SNAP during a morning press conference.USDA has argued that those funds can only be used for natural disasters or similar emergencies. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, agreed with that reasoning.“It certainly looks legitimate to me,” he said. “The contingency funds are not legally available to cover the benefits right now. The reason is because it's a finite source of funds. It was appropriated by Congress, and if they transfer funds from these other sources, it pulls it away immediately from school meals and infant formula. So … it's a trade off.” USDA earlier this month reshuffled funds to several nutrition programs, including WIC,  the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program. States scramblingStates are demanding answers about why USDA has paused SNAP benefits. On Friday, 23 state attorneys general sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and questioned the legal basis for the agency to pause benefits for SNAP.In the face of disappearing federal funds, states may choose to spend more on food assistance,  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said Monday she would “fast-track” $30 million in state emergency food assistance to supplement SNAP benefits.Johnson said that if Senate Democrats are worried about SNAP benefits not being available for November, they should pass the House’s stopgap government funding bill. “The best way for SNAP benefits to be paid on time is for the Democrats to end their shutdown, and that could happen right now, if they would show some spine,” Johnson said.",,,,2025-10-27 16:20:47.406307

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A national free speech advocacy group sent a letter on Monday to the president of University of Central Oklahoma accusing the state’s third-largest university of censoring student journalists. 
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, alleged that UCO has attempted to control the “content and distribution” of the campus’ student paper, The Vista. The Vista was established in 1903, but a student media advisory board in August voted to end printing physical copies, citing financial constraints. The publication continues to publish digitally. 
FIRE is the second First Amendment advocacy group to send a letter to UCO President Todd Lamb, citing concerns about free speech violations and censorship by administrators. FIRE aims to “defend and promote” free speech in classrooms and courtrooms.
A spokesperson for UCO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. University leaders have previously said that The Vista remains an independent publication and controls its own content. They’ve said that other college newspapers have transitioned to digital only.
But Dominic Coletti, program officer for FIRE’s Student Press Freedom Initiative, wrote that while The Vista is not “entitled” to UCO funding, the decision to end printing followed the administration being unhappy with the student coverage.
“As a public university bound by the First Amendment, UCO simply may not meddle with the editorial choices of an editorially independent newspaper. UCO’s actions impermissibly restrict the right to a free press the First Amendment guarantees all Americans,” Coletti wrote. 
Coletti asked that UCO offer a “substantive” response by Nov. 10 and allow The Vista to print and give students full editorial control.  
“Once a university recognizes a student publication, particularly when it and its predecessors have done so for over a century, it may only regulate the content and mode of distribution of students’ expression when the publication’s content would lead to significant ‘violent disruption,’” Coletti wrote. 
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a journalism legal group, also sent a letter to UCO earlier this month on behalf of six current or former students, accusing the university of ending print publications in an act of retaliation for “rigorous news coverage of university affairs.” 
Several UCO students are set to launch their own independent newsroom, The Independent View, on Tuesday with a website and a bi-weekly print publication. The newsroom has no funding from UCO, but has “significant start-up funding” and support from professional advisors, according to a Facebook post. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education Free Speech Committee has not received any formal complaints of free speech violations, a spokesperson said Monday. The committee, which was created by law in 2022, reviews policies and complaints related to free speech on college campuses. If a complaint is received, the committee will review it and determine next steps, the spokesperson said.

North Carolina faces a dire shortage of affordable housing. One need merely talk to friends and family members – even those with middle class incomes – to understand just how difficult it is to find affordable rental housing, much less homeownership opportunities.
That said, the numbers are bleak. The National Low Income Housing Coalition released a report this past summer entitled “Out of Reach: The High Cost of Housing” which showed how the wages that millions of hourly workers are earning don’t come close to what’s necessary. In North Carolina, a full-time worker must earn a minimum of $27.14 per hour to afford a modest, two-bedroom apartment. So how did we get here, how are policies in Washington deepening the crisis and what should we be doing? Back in August, Newsline got a chance to explore these questions and more in an extended conversation with the executive director of the North Carolina Housing Coalition, Samuel Gunter.
In Part One of our extended conversation with the executive director of the North Carolina Housing Coalition, Samuel Gunter, we dug into some of the details of our state and national affordable housing shortages, why the current market is failing millions, and why the latest budget cuts and policy changes emanating from Washington are not going to help.
In Part Two of our chat we turned to several related matters, including the way in which natural disasters and the Trump administration’s immigrant deportation policies are dramatically worsening the situation and how the recent Trump executive order targeting homeless people for arrest or involuntary commitment represents another significant step in the wrong direction.

Janet Mills and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau speak at a housing event in Brunswick on Oct. 25, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills, who is running to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, criticized her Democratic opponent Graham Platner and his now-covered up tattoo linked to Nazi symbolism.
“I obviously vehemently disagree with the things he’s been quoted as saying and doing,” Mills said at a housing event in Brunswick on Monday when asked by reporters whether the recent controversies should be disqualifying. “I obviously vehemently disagree with anybody having an abhorrent tattoo.”
Platner, a political newcomer, veteran and oysterman from Sullivan, has been making headlines in recent weeks after a slew of controversial past Reddit remarks were made public, including statements dismissing military sexual assaults, questioning Black patrons’ tipping habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans. That was followed by revelations that Platner got a tattoo while serving abroad that’s been associated with Nazi police.
The first public polling on the race that surveyed respondents amid the week of revelations, between Oct. 16 and 21, showed Platner with a wide lead among Democratic primary voters. Another survey from SoCal Strategies conducted Oct. 21-25 showed Mills, the Democratic establishment’s pick, ahead by five points.
The comments were the first Mills made in public about the tattoo. Since Mills launched her campaign and the controversies came to light, two other Democratic candidates have dropped out, criticizing the oysterman’s comments and endorsing Mills for the June 9 Democratic primary.

Platner has said publicly he got the skull and crossbones tattoo in 2007, when he was in the Marine Corps in his 20s during a night of drinking in Croatia. He also said he was unaware until recently that the image has been associated with Nazi police and has since had it covered.
Mills said the tattoo is the symbol that Hilter’s paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, officials “wore on their caps and their epaulets as they murdered 6 million Jewish people, including half a million children. So that is abhorrent.”
She did not clarify whether she thinks the tattoo is reason enough for Platner to drop out of the race. “What he should do in the future is not my business,” she said. “It’s up to the people.”
During the press conference, the governor was also asked about Collins’ role in the ongoing federal government shutdown, particularly whether she should be using her leadership within the Republican caucus to end the stalemate. 
“That’s a question for her,” Mills responded, focusing her criticisms broadly on President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives. The Republicans control the U.S. Senate. Republicans control the White House,” said Mills. “Meanwhile, the president should be at the table right now, solving this problem, before children go without food, before people go without health insurance and health care.”
Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), who was also at the housing event, stopped short of endorsing Mills but applauded her work with the Maine Legislature to pass bills to encourage more affordable housing development.
“A lot of states are pretty envious that we’ve had a governor who’s dug in on this and studied these issues and worked with us to get these issues solved, and we’re making steady progress,” he said. “That’s the kind of leader we need in all branches of government at all levels.”

A New Mexico rulemaking commission will hold hearings through Nov. 7 to consider stricter requirements for the amount of bond money oil and gas operators need to guarantee cleanup costs. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico environmental organizations on Monday submitted a petition with nearly 900 signatures urging a state board to adopt stricter rules for cleaning up oil and gas companies’ “orphaned wells.”
The state faces ballooning costs to clean up such wells, which can pollute groundwater and surrounding air, and also reduce surrounding wells’ efficiency. New Mexico has already spent tens of millions of dollars to plug about 1,000 wells since 2019, with more than 1,400 remaining.
Legislative analysts in June recommended updating the state’s rules around the bonds companies must guarantee to better reflect the costs for cleanup.
The proposed rules, introduced by regulators from the New Mexico State Land Office and the state Oil Conservation Division and backed by over a dozen environmental groups, would do just that.
Current law caps the financial assurance at $250,000 per operator for all active wells; the proposed rules would require oil and gas well owners to certify up to $150,000 per inactive or high-risk wells.
The Oil Conservation Commission, a three-member board that is considering the proposed rules, will hold daily hearings on them until Nov. 7. Members of the public can speak twice per day—between 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 5 p.m—until the end of the hearings.
The proposed rules would also increase the state’s authority during the transfer of well ownership, and ensure the new well owner has the money to clean up newly transferred wells.
Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter Director Camilla Feibelman delivered the petition and additional comments to the commission Monday on behalf of an 11-member coalition of groups from across the state. In an interview with Source NM, Feibelman said the proposed rules will address the high costs of cleanup, but also prevent operators who can’t afford to plug wells or have a record of not following the state’s rules, from inheriting them.
“If there is an operator of oil and gas who cannot afford to properly make a security deposit to the state for eventual harm to the state, then maybe they shouldn’t be operating,” she said.
The bottom line, she noted, is that New Mexicans “are looking for the oil and gas industry to “be better neighbors. “People understand that when private companies are taking a natural resource, in many cases off of our public lands, for private profit, that they should insure against their own cleanups,”
Oil and gas industry groups, including the Independent Petroleum Association and the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, have attempted to dismiss the proposed rules, calling them an “overreach” by regulators that would harm small producers.
In addition to the signatures, the petition included polling from Maryland-based Voss Research and Strategy that surveyed 400 registered New Mexico voters and reported—with a 4.9% margin of error—that 55% of respondents wanted the state to “do more than it currently does to make corporations clean up.”

House Speaker calls Virginia lawmakers back to Richmond as possible redistricting fight brews

The survey — conducted Oct. 21–23 by the Wason Center at Christopher Newport University among 803 likely voters — found Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading Republican Winsome Earle-Sears 50% to 43% in the governor’s race, with 6% undecided.
In the lieutenant governor’s contest, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, holds a slim 47% to 45% edge over Republican John Reid, a conservative talk-show host, while the attorney general’s race remains a virtual toss-up, with incumbent Republican Jason Miyares leading Democrat Jay Jones by a single point, 46%-to-45%. 
The single-point advantage marks a reversal from earlier polling that showed Jones up six points before the emergence of a damaging text-messaging scandal earlier this month.
According to the poll, 75% of likely voters have heard at least some coverage of Jones’ 2022 texts, and nearly half say the revelations could influence their vote. Among those aware of the reports, 56% say the messages make them less likely to support Jones, compared to 3% who say they make them more likely. Thirty-nine percent of polled voters said the scandal would not impact whether they plan to vote for Jones. 
The fallout appears most severe among independents, 68% of whom said the controversy makes them less inclined to back him.
Despite the turmoil, enthusiasm among voters remains strong.

Eighty-five percent of respondents described themselves as enthusiastic about voting, with little gap between parties — 65% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans said they were “very enthusiastic,” along with 47% of independents. 
About 29% of likely voters said they had already cast ballots, including 34% of Republicans, 30% of Democrats, and 23% of independents.
Spanberger’s seven-point advantage mirrors her strength among Democrats (97%) and women (57% to 37%), as well as Black voters (84% to 6%) and college-educated Virginians (58% to 35%). 
Earle-Sears leads among white voters (54% to 33%) and men (51% to 43%) and maintains 95% support from Republicans. The results mark a slight tightening since earlier this month, when Spanberger’s lead was 10 points.
Hashmi’s two-point advantage also reflects deep partisan divides. She draws 94% of Democrats and large margins among Black voters (+71) and women (+13), while Reid commands 97% of Republicans and leads among white voters (+15) and men (+10). 
The two are now tied among independents (44% each) after Hashmi’s earlier 12-point lead with that group evaporated.
In the broader battle for the House of Delegates, where all 100 seats are on the ballot this year, Democrats maintain an 8-point edge on the generic ballot (51% to 43%). That margin has held steady for weeks, underscoring a modest statewide advantage for Democrats as the party seeks to defend its 2023 majority.
Voters remain sharply divided on the issues driving their choices. 
Eighteen percent named threats to democracy as their top concern — matching inflation at 18% — followed by health care (11%) and immigration (9%). For Republicans, immigration (20%) and cost of living (19%) rank highest, while Democrats prioritize democracy (31%) and health care (19%). Independents split most between democracy (19%) and inflation (17%).
The poll, conducted by live interview on landlines and cell phones, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

Maine has the third highest percentage of special education students in the country. According to national data from 2022-23, 20.6% of all students in the state use special education services. 
Under the cover of the ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration has attempted to lay off over 450 employees at the U.S. Department of Education, including 120 within the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which serves millions of students with disabilities. Among the office’s responsibilities is administering federal funding under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, to provide guidance and support to families and states as well as investigate disability-based discrimination complaints.
A federal judge has temporarily blocked the layoffs, but national and local education experts are still concerned about the lapse in services that students in special education are legally entitled to receive.
“Secretary (Linda) McMahon and the Trump administration are turning their backs on 7.5 million children who have disabilities and their families,” National Education Association President Becky Pringle said on a press call earlier this month. “By eliminating experts and gutting the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, they are dismantling the critical supports that students and parents depend on.”
Impact on Maine
Maine special educators — who are already overwhelmed and underfunded — are worried about being able to consistently meet the needs of students amid the changing federal landscape, said Jesse Hargrove, president of the Maine Education Association, which represents most of the state’s teachers.
“Part of what we don’t know is, how this is going to affect educators? How soon will it affect them?” he said, adding that other impacts from the government shutdown are “compounding the situation.”
The pending layoffs and ongoing federal government shutdown, which just entered its fourth week, mean there’s fewer people responsible for ensuring special education students are getting the services they need by guaranteeing that states receive funding, training and technical assistance, according to Sarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine. 
In Maine specifically, the teacher preparation program, which receives federal assistance for recruiting and training special educators, is now at risk, she said. Also, federal grants underpin initiatives like the Maine Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports system, which is used by districts to identify and support all students based on their individual needs.
“Particularly for students with really high support needs, service providers are more specialized, and we already know there’s a shortage of them,” Wilkinson said. “And without that federal oversight and monitoring and technical assistance, it’s going to be really, really difficult for a small state like Maine to be able to continue to provide those services for students.”
The Maine Department of Education’s Office of Special Services and Inclusive Education has not yet experienced any disruption to funding or program operations as a result of these federal changes, according to department spokesperson Chloe Teboe. Also, federal allocations for Maine under the IDEA remain stable, she said. 
“The federal staffing reduction has, however, affected the Maine DOE’s ability to communicate directly with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education Programs (a division of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services), which provides technical assistance and clarification of federal requirements to states,” Teboe said.
Wilkinson said if staffing is not restored at the federal level soon, disruptions in services could start before the end 2025. She also said educators are beginning to notice an impact.
For example, at a national conference about behavioral interventions in Chicago last week, presenters from the Office of Special Education Programs that were scheduled to speak about training and technical assistance did not show up.
“We’re going to see a cascading effect,” Wilkinson added. “I think some of it seems far off now, but I think once it starts, it’s only going to be weeks before it trickles down to the district level.”
State-level support 
National and state level disability rights advocates said that it is important to remember that the IDEA law itself remains unchanged, which means families can still file complaints if they believe their child’s district has violated their right to a public education.
“These are really disorienting and uncertain times, but families just need to know that their children still have the same rights that they had, you know, three weeks ago or three years ago,” said Atlee Reilly, managing attorney for Disability Rights Maine.
“And I hope that that remains true,” he said. 
For families that seek support through The Arc of the United States, a national disability rights advocacy group, it’s a scary time, according to CEO Katy Neas.
“They have not changed the law,” she said. “They’ve just made it harder to implement and, when problems arise, harder to fix those problems.”
In Maine, complaints for IDEA violations are addressed by the Maine Department of Education, which is still required to stick with the same timeline and follow the federal law to address them. Families can also choose to file complaints with the Office for Civil Rights within the federal Department of Education (which enforces a different law, but can investigate allegations of discrimination based on disability), but that office has also faced severe staffing cuts, including the shuttering of the Boston location, where Maine complaints were previously directed.
“Those already took a very, very long time. And now I would imagine that there is not really a meaningful mechanism for resolving those things,” Reilly said.“I haven’t had anyone try to file anything since the shutdown, but I have heard others say that they, you know, get a bounce back from their local civil rights offices.”
Since the closure of the Boston office, Maine DOE had begun referring families with questions about potential violations based on disability status to the Office for Civil Rights with the Office of Special Education Programs, Teboe said. However, it is unclear how the special education staffing cuts will impact federal relief for their complaints.

The East Wing has been torn down to make space for a ballroom that President Donald Trump wanted to add to the building. Trump said it’s needed to accommodate more guests at the White House.
Trump estimated that the project could cost $300 million, all of which would be privately funded. Donors include Apple, Google, Lockheed Martin and T-Mobile, as well as the president himself.
Blumenthal said he wants to know the terms of the donations.
“Many of these corporations and billionaires have matters before the federal government,” Blumenthal said. “Comcast has a merger. Google, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon have federal contracts. Others may have contracts or matters before the federal government in the future.”
“The American public deserves to know whether there was any understanding, even if it was just implicit, that they will be favored as a result, and whether they are currying favor through these donations,” he continued.
Blumenthal sent letters to the 37 donors, requesting that they disclose the terms of their donations.

“Their attitude should be that they have nothing to hide, and if they are concealing something that’s relevant to the public interest, all the more reason to know about it,” Blumenthal said.
Though he is the ranking member of the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has subpoena powers, Blumenthal is a member of the minority. He would have to convince his Republican colleagues to issue the legal order.
“I’ll be very blunt, perfectly clear-eyed. I know that my Republican colleagues are not going to jump at the opportunity of issuing a subpoena,” Blumenthal said. “But I’m hoping that they will have an equal interest in knowing all of the circumstances surrounding these donations.”

(Photo by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The president of the Kansas Senate said Monday a sufficient number of Senate Republicans signed a petition to call a special session of the Legislature to consider new congressional district boundaries to improve odds of defeating Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids.
Senate President Ty Masterson, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, said the minimum 27 signatures, or a two-thirds majority of the Senate, had been achieved. Republicans hold a 31-9 advantage over Democrats in the chamber.
“The Kansas Senate Republican caucus has secured the signatures needed to exceed the constitutional threshold, demonstrating strong support for this call for a special session,” Masterson said. “This threshold having been met marks a critical step toward convening the session, pending the necessary two-thirds approval from the House of Representatives.”
To complete requirements in the Kansas Constitution for calling a special session, GOP leaders in the House need to obtain 84 signatures on its petition. In the House, the GOP possesses an 88-37 edge over Democrats.
Despite sending a letter to House Republicans lobbying for support of a special session, House Speaker Dan Hawkins has not announced he landed commitments from enough GOP peers. A spokesperson for Hawkins didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Masterson’s statement.
President Donald Trump, seeking to maintain GOP control of the U.S. House, urged Republican-led states to engage in mid-decade gerrymandering of U.S. House seats to prevent Democrats from winning a majority in November 2026.
Typically, redistricting in Kansas has been done every decade based on population shifts documented in the Census. In Kansas, that timeline meant mapping wouldn’t ordinarily be done again until 2032.
The objective of redistricting in Kansas in 2025 would be to distribute moderate voters of Johnson County into two or three congressional districts that would more likely be represented by Republicans.
Currently, Davids serves all of Johnson County, the southern half of Wyandotte County and all of Anderson, Franklin and Miami counties.
Davids won reelection to her 3rd District seat in 2022 and 2024 despite previous modification to her district to favor Republican nominees.
In response to debate about a special session, Davids raised the possibility of running for U.S. Senate next year against U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican.
One redistricting prize available to Republicans would be a Trump endorsement in the governor’s race. Former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Masterson and others competing for the nomination and would covet an alliance with the president.
“We’re sending a clear message: We’re ready to get it done. We look forward to working our agenda to make Kansas and America great again,” Masterson said in his statement about the GOP Senate petition.
In addition to redistricting, Republican legislative leaders said a November special session could include consideration of bills on transgender rights and property taxes.
On Oct. 13, the GOP-controlled Legislative Coordinating Council approved spending up to $460,000 on a special session.
“It is clear that Republicans are not focused on the kitchen table issues that Kansans care about,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes.
Gov. Laura Kelly said she was opposed to mid-decade redistricting because that work would rely on outdated population counts from 2020. She urged the Legislature to conduct public hearings before voting on a new congressional map. In addition, she said the Kansas Supreme Court could find new maps unconstitutional.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Masterson-9-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-27 16:01:40.937082

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A new survey shows a gulf between popular opinion and political reality in Kansas, and reveals that few people recognize the name of any candidate for governor in next year’s election.
Most Kansans support unregulated access to abortion, the legalization of recreational marijuana and Medicaid expansion, according to the annual Kansas Speaks survey, in which respondents offered a more favorable view of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly than of Republican President Donald Trump.
About one-third said they knew of former Gov. Jeff Colyer, making him the most recognized candidate for governor.
The survey, conducted by the the Docking Institute of Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University, questioned 525 Kansas adults about their feelings on a wide range of public policy and political issues. The online survey was conducted between Sept. 26 and Oct. 14, and results were released Monday.
Michael Smith, a political science professor at Emporia State University who worked on the survey, said the results show “lots of daylight” on policy issues between Kansans and Trump, and legislative leadership.
“Clearly these voters are not MAGA. MAGA does not constitute a majority of the people of Kansas or the United States,” Smith said. “These are people that have a very low opinion of the Democratic Party as an organization, because on issues a lot of our respondents look like Democrats, but they voted for Trump.”
About 47% said they were satisfied with Kelly, while 27.3% were dissatisfied. For Trump, 43.5% were satisfied while 46.2% were dissatisfied.
“If you just isolate where voters stand on issues, they appear to be a good deal more progressive than if you ask them their party label,” said Alexandra Middlewood, who worked on the survey and is chair of the political science department at Wichita State University. “And Laura Kelly has been able to wiggle out of that. I’m not even sure if she’s perceived as a Democrat. She’s just perceived as Laura Kelly.”
Among the issues, 64.8% favored legalizing recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older so the state could tax it, and 70.4% support legalizing medical marijuana. The was 70.2% support for Medicaid expansion. And 59.5% agreed that state government should not place any regulations on the circumstances under which women can get abortions.
“We only have two parties in the United States,” Middlewood said. “They have their platforms, but all of those issues kind of get washed out by the other issues that are parts of those platforms. And so you could have someone who supports abortion rights but still votes Republican, because maybe abortion rights is not the most important issue to them, and they have all of these other issues that they care about.”
On immigration, about two-thirds said immigrants contribute to the country’s economic growth and the state’s economic vitality. But 43.7% agreed there were too many immigrants coming into the U.S, and 38.1% agreed that “illegal immigrants” should be put in detention camps.
 
Governor’s race
The survey asked about name recognition and positive or negative views on eight Republican and three Democratic candidates for governor.
Kelly is term limited and can’t seek reelection.
Colyer was the best-known candidate with 35.1% recognition, followed by Secretary of State Scott Schwab at 29.1%, Senate President Ty Masterson at 25.3% and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt at 24.4%. All are Republicans.
“Most people have never heard of any of these candidates,” Smith said.
Masterson had the highest negative rating of any candidate at 19.5%, followed by Colyer at 17.9%.
Middlewood attributed the negative view of Colyer to his connection to former Gov. Sam Brownback. Colyer served as lieutenant governor under Brownback, then became governor in 2018 when Brownback joined the Trump administration.
For Masterson, she said, “the hardest thing he’s going to have to overcome is just the abysmal satisfaction rates with the Kansas Legislature.” The survey showed just 34% are satisfied with the Legislature while 31.2% are dissatisfied.
Smith said Schmidt’s best option was to let the other candidates fight over conservative voters while she secures moderates.
“There are so many vying to be the most conservative, if they cancel each other’s votes out, she might have a shot,” Smith said.
Republican Joy Eakins, a former Wichita school board member, recorded the highest positive rating at 53.9%, followed by Schmidt at 46.2% and Colyer at 44.8%.
Among Democrats, just 16.6% recognized Sen. Ethan Corson, 16.2% recognized Marty Tuley, a personal trainer from Lawrence, and 15.7% recognized Sen. Cindy Holscher.
 
Survey methods
The architects of the survey weighted results by age, gender, education and, for the first time, party registration.
The decision to use party registration to fine-tune the results followed scrutiny of last year’s poll, which incorrectly predicted Trump would win the state by just 5 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump ended up with a 16-point advantage.
Brett Zollinger, director of the Docking Institute at Fort Hays State, and assistant director Jian Sun, worked with Smith and Middlewood to craft this year’s survey. They chose questions based on past surveys, issues they see in the legislative session and issues of national interest. They relied on national vendor QualtricsXM to build a panel of survey respondents that would closely mirror state demographics.
Of the respondents, 82.5% said they were registered voters.
“You simply have to weight for partisanship,” Smith said. “In the past, what we’ve done is we’ve looked at demographics. So older white people, for example, are more likely to vote Republican, rural people are more likely to vote Republican, and so on and so forth. All of that is true, but there’s an X factor there, which is Republicans are more likely to vote Republican.
“Any demographic you can name, whether it’s age, gender, urban, rural — it still really comes down to just Republicans are more likely to vote Republican. And so you really have to weight for partisanship in and of itself. It’s not just about the demographics anymore.”
The survey also asked about child care, senior care, water conservation, artificial intelligence, gun ownership and perceived causes of homelessness.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A plan to overhaul statewide testing in Oklahoma public schools is now on hold, with the state’s top education official announcing Monday that spring assessments will continue as usual this year.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields said his administration will consider new approaches to statewide testing, but the process won’t change this year like his predecessor, Ryan Walters, promised. Fields advised school districts to “proceed as normal” with the annual tests, which the state uses to measure student and school performance.
Walters abruptly declared in August that he would do away with traditional state tests this school year and replace them with a wholly different assessment method. But, it appears Walters’ administration never submitted his plan to the federal government to implement the changes, said Tara Thompson, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
The U.S. Department of Education must give approval before a state can alter its testing program. Both state and federal law require testing of public school students.
Before his Sept. 30 resignation, Walters described his testing plan as nearly a done deal, predicting he would receive “very, very quick” approval from the Trump administration. His comments reportedly frustrated federal officials and led U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to exclude Walters from her August visit to Oklahoma.

Currently, Oklahoma students in grades 3-8 take statewide tests in math and reading each spring. Students in grades 5, 8 and 11 take a yearly science test. Eleventh graders also take a statewide U.S. history test and are tested in math and reading by completing the ACT.
Walters proposed eliminating the statewide math and reading tests. He suggested replacing them with benchmark assessments that students would take multiple times a year to give more up-to-date information on their academic progress. 
Rather than having all students take the same incremental benchmark tests, Walters said he would allow districts to choose which assessments to purchase from private vendors. 
Although some states have adopted the benchmark testing method, Oklahoma would have been the first state to use a patchwork of district-selected assessments. The Trump administration rejected a similar proposal from Arizona in 2018.
After collecting public comment for a month on Walters’ plan, his administration would have had to request a waiver from the federal government and be granted permission to make the overhaul. By then, Walters was only a few weeks away from resigning to lead a conservative nonprofit.
Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Fields to finish Walters’ term through January 2027.
Fields hasn’t discarded the idea of updating the assessment process. He said he agrees there is a need for change in state testing, but “meaningful change takes time.”
“We are in discussions with the U.S. Department of Education and in the coming weeks, we will begin to explore innovative assessment options for future years,” Fields said in his announcement.

Tim Walz is giving food banks a $4 million boost as the emergency food system braces for the temporary pause of SNAP benefits due to the federal government shutdown. 
SNAP — Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps — is paid for by the federal government, and funding has run out. Recipients will not receive their benefits — usually in the form of a credit on an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card — in the month of November unless Congress reconvenes and passes a spending bill. 
That means the 440,000 Minnesotans who typically rely on SNAP for food are likely to seek help from food shelves instead. Most SNAP recipients are children, seniors and people with disabilities.
Jason Viana, executive director of The Open Door food shelf in Eagan, said his organization is already seeing heightened demand, and is planning to increase distribution in the coming weeks. 
“All the work and care of our community is not enough to solve an absolutely solvable crisis,” Viana said Monday at a press conference. 
Walz visited The Open Door to discuss the $4 million his administration is sending to food shelves around the state to temporarily boost food supply. 
The $4 million will “absolutely be enough to help for a small period of time, but it won’t make us whole,” Viana said. 
The money comes from the Department of Human Services budget. Most is from the “human services fund,” which is intended for emergency services, said Tikki Brown, commissioner of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. The rest is from the Family First Prevention Services Act, which is meant to support at-risk children and families. 
Walz said members of Congress need to “get back to work,” though he also said that Democrats should continue to refuse to vote for a budget bill that doesn’t include health care subsidies for “as long as it takes.”

SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Although funded by the federal government, SNAP in Florida is administered by DCF’s Office of Economic Self-Sufficiency, which is responsible for determining eligibility.
USDA —  in a notice it posted Friday — put the blame on Democrats for not agreeing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. Democrats are against passing a funding plan that doesn’t extend the enhanced premiums tax credits that lower the costs of so-called Obamacare plans purchased through the federal health exchange (healthcare.gov).
The partisan impasse has resulted in a 27-day government shutdown, which began Oct. 1, the start of the federal fiscal year.
“The best way for SNAP to continue is for the shutdown to end. If not for Congressional Democrats blocking government funding, November SNAP benefits would be paid on-time,” the memo, first reported by Axios, notes.
SNAP has about $6 billion in contingency funds; $9 billion is needed to cover the costs of the program through November. But the federal memo says that SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to float the program during the shutdown.
Contingency funds “are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits. The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,” the memo says.
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities President Sharon Parrott, a former official with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), says that’s not the case.
“Speaking as a former OMB official, I know from experience that the federal government has the authority and the tools it needs during a shutdown to get these SNAP funds to families. Even at this late date, the professionals at the Department of Agriculture and in states can make this happen. And, to state the obvious, benefits that are a couple of days delayed are far more help to families than going without any help at all,” Parrott said in a written statement.
“It would be unconscionable for the Administration to go out of its way to threaten millions of children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, parents, and workers with hunger, rather than taking all legal steps available to provide food assistance to people who need it.”
Florida Policy Institute senior policy analyst Cindy Huddleston told the Florida Phoenix that more than 70% of Florida SNAP beneficiaries are children, seniors, and people with disabilities. But the cuts impact more than families in need.
“But it also affects the bottom line of thousands of small businesses in Florida where SNAP participants shop. USDA, which already has the money to provide assistance to every family participating in SNAP for almost all of November, should release those funds immediately and also transfer other available funds so that those in need do not go hungry and local businesses can stay afloat,”  she said in an email to the Phoenix.
The elimination of SNAP dovetails with the start of 2026 enrollment in the federal health exchange.
Florida leads the nation in Obamacare enrollment with more than 4.6 million residents.
Due to the elimination of the enhanced premium tax credits (and the damage that is expected to cause to enrollment) and increases in costs of prescription drugs, health insurance overall costs are going to increase.
Florida Office of Insurance Regulation Deputy Commissioner for Life and Health Alexis Bakofsy said earlier this month there would be an average 34% increase in premiums effective effect Jan. 1.

The Indiana Department of Health on Monday announced the state’s first flu-related death of the 2025-26 season.
No other additional information about the patient was provided due to privacy laws.
During flu season, which typically runs from October through May, hundreds of people become ill from influenza, according to IDOH. Some cases are fatal. More than 660 Hoosiers died after contracting influenza during the 2024-25 flu season.
“Each year we want to stress the importance of taking steps to prevent influenza, which can quickly become a serious illness for some Hoosiers and can even be life-threatening,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Lindsay Weaver.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone age 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each year. Annual flu vaccines are available and are safe and effective protection against becoming seriously ill, the state health officials said in the news release.
The CDC also recommends early vaccination, as it takes about two weeks for the antibodies — which protect against flu — to develop in the body. The holiday season when families gather indoors is approaching, too.
Practicing the “Three Cs” can help toprevent the spread of flu and other infectious diseases:

Clean: Properly wash hands with warm, soapy water
Cover: Cover your cough and sneeze into your arm or disposable tissue
Contain: Stay home from school or work when you are sick to prevent the spread of germs.

Some Hoosiers are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications such as pneumonia, hospitalization and death. Among the most susceptible are pregnant women, young children (especially those too young to get vaccinated), people who are immunocompromised or who have certain chronic illnesses, and the elderly.
Common signs and symptoms of the flu include:

fever of 100° Fahrenheit or higher
cough
sore throat
headache
fatigue
muscle aches
runny or stuffy nose

Flu season data is reflected on the IDOH influenza dashboard each week and is updated on Mondays. Due to reporting timeframes, the first reported death will be reflected in the Nov. 3 update. The dashboard also contains historical flu surveillance data, broken down by county, region and age group.

Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) presents a package of anti-human trafficking bills to the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety committee. Oct. 23. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. A bipartisan group of state senators presented a package of bills seeking to prevent human trafficking by increasing punishments for perpetrators in a meeting of the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety committee last Thursday. 
State Sens. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs), Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) and Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills) each spoke to the committee on their respective bills. 
“No law can singlehandedly eliminate human trafficking. It’s already illegal, but yet new victims are ensnared every single day,” Damoose said. “But the challenge we put forth in crafting this package was simple: to create laws where, by two years from today, a significant number of women or children or men will wake up and not be trafficked that day, who otherwise would have been without these laws, and that’s what I believe we have here today.”
Michigan has a nationally high rate of human trafficking, with only six states having a higher number of cases in 2024, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. There were 340 cases confirmed in Michigan last year, and 585 victims identified. 
“Human trafficking is a crime of exploitation and using control and submission,” said Melissa Palepu, an Attorney Specialist in Human Trafficking and Child Abuse at the state Attorney General’s office. “Human trafficking, which includes both labor trafficking and sex trafficking, is a thriving enterprise in the world and in Michigan, making an estimated $254 billion a year in profits.”

The bills, introduced as SB 520 through 524, would increase penalties for those found guilty of human trafficking, as well as increasing the age at which a victim is considered a child from 16 to 18 years old. 
“It is important to adjust the sentencing of these crimes so we can better address the root cause of these problems by punishing the individuals who pay for and solicit these acts instead of victimizing the trafficked individual even further,” Webber noted.
Damoose further emphasized that the goal behind the bills was to disincentivize people from in any way involving themselves with trafficking, adding, “Importantly, if these bills pass, the state of Michigan will now be on record telling those who traffic a child that they may be going to prison for the rest of their life.” 
However, some of those testifying raised concerns about those increased penalties being weaponized against trafficking victims themselves — especially regarding bills 522 and 523, which would allow for children to be removed from their parents’ care in the case of a trafficking conviction. 
Megan Reynolds, a family law attorney at Michigan Poverty Law Program, explained an existing statute, which designates a parent as a perpetrator if, she said, “one is suspected of placing their child at an unreasonable risk of harm due to the parents failure to take reasonable steps to intervene to eliminate that risk,” including if they are in a situation where they themselves are being trafficked. 
Under these bills, if passed, that would be grounds to terminate that person’s parental rights, immediately. 
“In a powerless position where you’re being trafficked, you didn’t do enough to protect your child from the real trafficker,” Reynolds explained. “That would create grounds for that parent to not only have a petition to terminate their rights filed, but then to have that accelerated in the definition of aggravated circumstances.”
Meanwhile, Elizabeth Campbell, the director of the Human Trafficking and Immigration Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School cited statistics about how victims and survivors of trafficking themselves can face criminal charges related to their own trafficking. 
“A National Survivor Network survey reported over 90% of survivors have been arrested, almost always for crimes tied directly to their trafficking,” she said. 
Gonzalo Peralta, a Senior Staff Attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said that he wants to “ensure farm worker families, who are often victims of labor, traffic trafficking themselves, are not doubly penalized, and immigrants are not considered acceptable collateral damage.” This is especially important in today’s anti-immigrant climate, he added. 
Chang, who also chairs the committee, acknowledged those concerns, and referenced a meeting between lawmakers and advocates to mitigate the potential harms. 
“I want to ensure that we don’t cause any unintentional harm to parents who are themselves victims of human trafficking,” she said. “So we are going to continue to have more conversations on this topic to address those concerns and ensure that the final product of this bill comes out in the best form that it can to protect minors, other human trafficking victims and survivors, and holds traffic traffickers accountable.”
A package of bills, many regarding the rights of human trafficking victims, has also been introduced in the Michigan House of Representatives. 
“This department believes that in order to eradicate human trafficking in Michigan, we must do the following,” Palepu said. “First, we must keep a victim centered approach and aim to provide survivors with legal protection as well as the ability to help heal and grow and become productive members of society. We do believe that the House package that is a companion package to this will address those. Second, we must strengthen our tools for prevention and increased accountability, which is what we believe the Senate bills will do.”
Bayer also noted in her statements introducing the bills that together they wanted to make sure that any legislation they created would focus on protecting victims first. 
“We will always make sure that this legislation does stop the traffickers and protects those who are victims,” she stated. “Otherwise, it’s not worth our time.”

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, said Oct. 27, 2025, that she voluntarily had her congressional paycheck withheld until resolution of the current federal government shutdown. All five Republican members of the Kansas delegation have done likewise. In this image, Davids speaks during an April 30, 2025, budget hearing in the U.S. House. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. House YouTube channel)TOPEKA — All six members of the Kansas congressional delegation voluntarily put a halt to payment of their federal salaries during the ongoing government shutdown.
The latest to join the group, Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of the 3rd District, said Monday that she sent a letter to the chief administrative officer of the U.S. House requesting her paycheck be withheld until adoption of a bipartisan resolution to the impasse.
“Washington’s dysfunction is unacceptable, and Kansans have had enough,” Davids said. “I continue to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to the table to end this shutdown, and I will refuse to accept a paycheck until this shutdown is resolved.”
Other Kansans, all Republicans, also declined paychecks during the standoff: U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann of the 1st District, U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt of the 2nd District and U.S. Rep. Ron Estes of the 4th District.
Members of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate earn $174,000 in annual salary, which amounts to $14,500 per month.
The U.S. House passed a bill that would keep the federal government open into November, but the Senate hasn’t been able to reach agreement on a funding measure.
Schmidt, who represents much of rural eastern Kansas, said “the whole situation is so unnecessary and very frustrating.”
He said the Senate had two options: One, pass the “clean, bipartisan” bill endorsed more than a month ago by the House. Or, the Senate could approve a different bill that could be voted on by the House.
Estes said failure of Congress to pass a temporary funding bill didn’t stop paychecks from going to lawmakers during a shutdown. He sent a letter weeks ago to U.S. House administrators with instructions to withhold his net pay until an appropriations agreement took effect.
Payton Fuller, a spokesperson for Marshall, said the GOP senator likewise “feels strongly that if federal workers and the military are required to work without pay, then it’s not right for him to be accepting a paycheck.”
In a recent interview, Marshall said a breakthrough could occur Nov. 1 because air traffic controllers and members of the military were due a paycheck. He said political pressure could be “the seminal moment that pushes us forward.”
The federal budget dispute also poses a threat to recipients of SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which delivers food aid to approximately 187,000 people in Kansas. It risks suspension of funding for WIC, the program for Women, Infants and Children that provides healthy food, breastfeeding support and nutrition education to about 50,000 Kansans.
Thousands of Kansans have been placed on furlough in October, but federal employees viewed as essential have been required to stay on the job without pay. Kansas is home to more than 25,000 federal employees and more than 21,000 active-duty members of the military
“My mom, an Army veteran, raised my brothers and me on her own,” Davids said. “If she had missed even one paycheck, it could’ve meant choosing between keeping the lights on or putting food on the table.”
She said an agreement by Congress to reopen the federal government should include a provision protecting families from rising health care costs when insurance tax credits expired later this year.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sharice-Davids-budget-2.png,,,2025-10-27 15:01:48.472476
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 18:21:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: Clouds form over CT’s clean energy plans,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/podcast-ct-clean-energy-plans/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Jan Ellen Spiegel discussed her article about how federal changes are affecting Connecticut's wind and solar energy plans.,"Connecticut had high hopes for wind and solar energy. Changes at the federal level have cast clouds over those plans.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “CT needs to plan for its energy future, but the view is cloudy,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Jan’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Jan. This summer, the Trump administration issued a stop-work order on Revolution Wind, the offshore wind project, which is backed by Connecticut and Rhode Island. Is that what prompted you to explore this issue more?
JES: Actually, no. It was one, certainly one factor. But this was already well underway. There have been a series of moves by Donald Trump in the second administration, starting from day one, that clearly were designed to, shall we say, impede, if not outright kill, certain types of renewable energy, most prominently offshore wind, to some degree, onshore wind and solar. And we were all forewarned. He slow walked this stuff in the first administration, and with a variety of executive orders on day one, you could see he was coming for him again, and he was coming for them much stronger.
The stop-work order on Revolution Wind, which didn’t come until the end of August, and the subsequent stop-work order on another offshore project in New York, are more closely symptoms of all the other things he’d done, and he had done a number of things.
WSHU: Let’s take a step back. What are Connecticut’s plans for its energy future?
JES: Well, what they are and maybe going forward could be very different. First of all, there was a lot of emphasis being put on offshore wind, and certainly getting this project up and running was critical. If you may recall, there was an earlier offshore wind project that eventually got canceled as a result of the pandemic and increased prices and whatnot, and Connecticut had backed off on any additional stuff. Whether there would be more remains to be seen. The state itself, like almost every other state in New England and many other states in the northeast, has clean energy goals, as does Connecticut, and there are different ways that those can be attained. But offshore wind in particular was a huge component, because you can get massive amounts of energy and energy akin to one of the units in the Millstone nuclear power station.
Plus, there were some other things underway designed to get onshore wind down from Maine, which has been a goal now for 15 years; it just hasn’t really materialized. And the transmission line to do that had been seriously delayed for years. That is actually almost done as well. The concern broadly on all this stuff, is that the Trump administration, which does not like renewable power, especially offshore wind, he doesn’t like onshore wind all that much either, but he has a little less control over it, because unless it’s on federal land, offshore wind, because it is in federally controlled waters that he has a lot of control over.
He doesn’t like solar much either. Solar, of course, also would not necessarily end up on federal land, but it has enjoyed some very, very robust energy tax credits, federal tax credits on the order of 30% which is a big tax credit for a number of years now, and that for certain systems, most residential purchase systems, that ends at the end of this year. That was another action by the Trump administration. It came in early July, and for commercial systems and lease systems, it has another year to go. Bottom line, you pile all these together, you’ve got an absolute target on offshore wind. You have a financial target on solar that can make it a lot more expensive. You have the prospect of having to deal with federal permitting on certain things. And if you and the Trump administration don’t like it, they can slow that down or kill that, which is part of what they’ve done with other offshore wind. It’s not the kind of perfect storm you want to see if you’re, if you’re the Department of Energy Environmental protection.
WSHU: Now, the Trump administration has been pushing clean coal. We got rid of all our coal-fired power stations in Connecticut. Is there any future there?
JES: First of all, let’s just be clear, there is no such thing as clean coal. People need to understand that Donald Trump may use that terminology, but what he is loosely referring to is a coal plant that will capture the emissions from it and store them. It’s a technology that has never been perfected. It is barely in use. It is not something that exists. New England has no more coal plants. The last one, which was in New Hampshire, closed recently, which was a year earlier than expected. Coal is worldwide and in the U.S. a dying industry at the moment. I mean, I can’t speak for financial people, but would investors reinvest in coal plants? Hard to say. But if I were a betting person, I would bet not. He has issued permits to extend the use of coal plants in other parts of the country for longer periods. But will that happen in New England? No. I mean, they’re basically shut down. It’s not stuff that is due to shut down. Where New England has to worry about coal is the emissions coming from it, because we are located where we are located, we get all kinds of pollution from that, from greenhouse gases to, you know, standard pollutants that cause all kinds of health problems here.
WSHU: Now, energy prices aren’t coming down. So what is the future? What are regulators and policymakers looking at right now?
JES: What is being looked at right now at the federal level? The feds, yes, they want to keep coal going. They are also doing more oil and gas leasing, which has either been eliminated or tamped down in some ways. Will that impact folks here in Connecticut? Potentially, natural gas plants could stay open longer than had been intended. The likelihood of building another natural gas plant is very expensive, and the materials for them have been in very short supply for years to come. We also don’t know what tariffs are going to do to various materials. We don’t know what is going to happen in terms of needed minerals for that kind of thing. So that’s one bucket. A lot of folks look at the millstone plant, which has a lot of power. It’s 2100 megawatts more or less together, can run 24/7, and it supplies about a little less than a third of the power along with the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. It supplies about a third of the power in New England. It’s already extended its license.
Again, nuclear plants can run for quite a while. There’s a lot of discussion about advanced nuclear plants and whatnot, and there’s a lot of misconceptions and misinformation out there in terms of what is actually available in terms of that advanced nuclear, and the bottom line is, it’s not available. In some cases, the technology doesn’t fully exist yet, and it’s many, it’s, you know, you’re talking 2030, at the earliest. And I will have more details on that in the future.
WSHU: Okay. But basically, can we say that there is a glimmer of a silver lining to the dark clouds for our energy future?
JES: Oh, there are a couple of yin and yangs to them. Look at one of the reasons everybody is scrambling for power; presumably, we’re going to have all this AI. We’re going to have all these data centers, not many of which have ever ended up in New England, for a lot of economic reasons. Land is expensive. There’s not all that much space. And it’s unclear whether it’s going to pan out to the levels that some people think it will, and I’ve heard that from some, you know, pretty high-end economists who are a little skeptical, we’re going to need that much power. Also, if you’re pulling tax credits off things like electric vehicles, which are gone, that was going to be kind of a power suck. Will those tax credits being gone then diminish the demand for EVs so you won’t need as much power as possible?
The flip side of that is, if people aren’t building as much solar, then you are taking away that great hedge of not needing enough power. So it’s hard to say. What people in New England and Connecticut don’t always realize is that power demand in the region for 10-15 years has been flat, if not lower than it was expected. The independent system operator that runs the grid expects that in the next 10 years, it’ll increase by about 11% but that was before all this happened. Will it continue to increase like that? Unclear. In a sense, the biggest issue here is that you have all kinds of entities preparing for future power needs. There are so many wrinkles and so many uncertainties and so many outright hand grenades being thrown into this thing. I keep asking people, well, how do you plan? And it’s hard. These guys just don’t totally know now how to plan for a future where the power plant they were expecting, just like Revolution Wind, might get stopped. And now, what do we do? It’s very, very difficult for that future. We can say what’s out there, you know, maybe more nuclear way down the road, you know, would someone build another gas plant? Unclear. Will people keep investing in solar because it will help their own personal electric rates? It’s possible, but we don’t know. So the trajectory we have been on, the odds of the region, because we are a regional grid staying on. That could be anybody’s guess at this point.
WSHU: So, bottom line, it’s much more difficult for policymakers to try and figure this out.
JES: Yes, if their goal is to keep energy rates low, boy, this is about the biggest wrinkle that could have been thrown at them.
WSHU: Well, it’s a great way to go into the winter when we’re thinking about our energy costs. Thank you so much, Jan.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25125499978507-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 17:01:14.906323
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 18:11:02+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Much of state-funded affordable housing is rehabbed property,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/ct-affordable-housing-rehabilitated-new-units/,It wasn't clear from the Office of Legislative Research report how much the properties actually expanded the state's overall housing stock.,"More than half of the affordable housing units Connecticut funded over the past six years were rehabilitated properties, as opposed to new construction, a report from the state’s Office of Legislative Research found.
The report, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror, examined the number of state-sponsored affordable housing units built during Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration. The report showed that just over 13,700 units of affordable housing have received state funding since 2019, and about 8,000 of those were rehabilitated homes rather than new construction.
It wasn’t clear from the report how much the rehabilitated properties actually expanded the state’s overall housing stock. 
That has raised questions about Gov. Ned Lamont’s claims that under his leadership, the state is building more housing than in past years.
At a Department of Housing conference last week, the governor said, “We built more new housing … over the last three years than we have during any three-year period 10, 20 years ago. We’ve built probably 70% more housing than during that time.”
“We have built more housing in the last three years, in the last six years than we have in the decade before,” he said at a Stamford event earlier this month.
Housing experts say it’s not clear what data Lamont is referring to when he makes claims like these, although he clarified after the housing conference that he was referring to state-sponsored housing.
“I think a lot of the conversation makes it sound like we’re talking about new homes only, and those numbers are generally quite a bit lower than the numbers for preservation,” said Sean Ghio, policy director at the Partnership for Strong Communities. “It’s not a very nuanced conversation, just to take the total number.”
“When I hear, ‘We’re building more housing than we have,’ that’s kind of a general statement. I need to understand better what’s underneath that,” Ghio said.
Housing costs in Connecticut have been rising for the past several years, and multiple estimates show the state lacks upwards of 100,000 units of housing that are affordable and available to its lowest-income renters. During the last legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that aimed to reform zoning and increase housing stock, but Lamont vetoed the measure saying he wanted to get towns on board.
There are myriad ways of measuring Connecticut’s housing progress, like tracking the number of affordable units built or market-rate units built. Each year, the state also tracks the number of units demolished.
Rehabilitating housing to ensure it stays on the market is also important, experts say, because the state’s housing needs include retrofitting units so they work for families, people with disabilities, people with the lowest incomes and seniors.
Still, the legislative research report showed that the last three years have actually seen a slight decline in the number of affordable housing units built or rehabilitated compared to the three years prior. Ghio noted that much of the building completed in the early years of the Lamont administration likely came from funding allocated under Gov. Dannel Malloy’s administration.
From 2019 to 2021, there were 6,677 state-sponsored units completed. From 2022 to 2024, there were 5,277 — not including the units from the Department of Housing’s Build4CT program. The OLR report didn’t analyze that program but noted that there were 484 units of housing built in 2024 and 2025 through Build4CT.
Since Lamont took office in 2019, his administration has invested $713 million in state funding through the Department of Housing, the governor’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement. That has generated nearly $3 billion in “private-public investment,” including resources from the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority.
“Despite this progress, the ripple effect of the pandemic — which is now being felt — along with high interest rates, tariffs, supply chain disruptions and material costs or access, have hampered construction,” Blanchard said.
He added that there are another 7,000 units under construction, paid for with another $400 million in state funds. He didn’t say whether the units were new construction or rehabilitated homes.
New affordable housing is concentrated in a handful of towns
The governor has also commended towns for making progress. But in his speech at the Department of Housing last week, he acknowledged that much of the affordable housing is concentrated in a just a handful of the state’s larger cities.
The 10 municipalities with the most completed units from 2019 to 2025 accounted for more than 60% of the affordable housing built statewide. The five largest cities — Bridgeport, Stamford, New Haven, Hartford and Waterbury accounted for about 43% of all completed units. Ninety-eight towns had completed no affordable housing units.
“It’s true that probably 75% of that housing is in our 20 biggest towns and cities. And I want that widely distributed, no question about it, but I do like the fact that our towns and cities are coming back to life,” Lamont said at the housing conference last week.

Experts say that the data calls into question whether towns are really making progress without state intervention.
“What would be interesting [would be] an analysis of which towns have rezoned for how many units,” said Melissa Kaplan-Macey, chief initiative officer at the Housing Collective. “There’s a lot of conversation about intent, but I think really getting to action is where the rubber meets the road.”
Kaplan-Macey said for many towns, restrictive zoning makes it hard to build apartments. Experts have long pointed to zoning as a key reason for the lack of housing in Connecticut, but many town officials maintain that local control is important for zoning.
Connecticut and New England have also seen “slower and more uneven” growth in housing than the nation over the past decade. Connecticut has seen a decrease in overall housing starts in six of the last eight fiscal years, the OLR report found.

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)More than 163,000 New Jerseyans cast early in-person ballots on Saturday and Sunday, marking a decline from turnout records set for last year’s presidential race.
Statewide, 163,428 voters cast machine ballots in person this weekend, down from the 247,003 that cast ballots in person during the opening weekend of last year’s early-voting period.
The reduction falls in line with expectations for this year’s elections, when the gubernatorial race and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot. Turnout for federal elections, and presidential races in particular, is typically higher than turnout for state races.
The front-runners in the governor’s race are Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D).
[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]More Democrats came out than Republicans. Statewide, 68,665 Democrats cast early in-person votes, compared to 63,178 Republicans.
Turnout among unaffiliated voters was comparatively low: Only 30,943 voters not aligned with any political party cast early votes this weekend. Another 642 votes came from voters registered with a minor party.
The weekend’s turnout represents a fraction of the voters who will likely cast ballots in the top-of-the-ballot race by the time Election Day ends. There are 6.6 million registered voters in New Jersey. Roughly 2.6 million total cast ballots for governor in the last gubernatorial election in 2021.
Monmouth County, where 17,475 cast early votes, saw the greatest early voting turnout this weekend, followed by Bergen (16,112), Ocean (15,204), and Morris (11,900).
Those rankings are similar to the ones seen during last year’s early-voting opening weekend. Then, Bergen reported the highest vote totals, followed closely by Monmouth and Ocean counties.
Essex (10,965), Union (10,552), Hudson (10,459), and Middlesex (10,117) counties also reported receiving more than 10,000 early in-person votes this weekend.
Salem County, by far New Jersey’s least populous county, saw the lowest turnout. Just 886 Salem County residents voted this weekend, down from 1,735 in last year’s opening weekend.
Democrats had an early voting edge in 11 of the state’s 21 counties, with Republicans ahead in the other 10.
New Jersey’s nine-day early voting period runs through Sunday, Nov. 2. Eligible voters can cast ballots at any early polling center in their county. Those centers are open between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
Voters can also cast early votes through the mail, either by sending a vote-by-mail ballot to their county’s Board of Elections, placing it in a secure ballot drop box, or by hand-delivering it to their county’s Board of Elections.
Mail ballots can be cast at a secure drop box or county elections office until 8 p.m. on Election Day, and mail ballots returned through the post will be counted so long as they are postmarked by Election Day and reach officials no later than six days after the election.
Mail-in ballots cannot be cast in person at polling places.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Iowa lawmakers U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, along with U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin, urged a “coordinated action” across the Trump administration to prioritize soybeans in a trade deal with China and to finalize renewable fuel guidelines. 
The GOP lawmakers addressed a letter Monday on behalf of soybean producers and related industries who have been “priced out of the market” due to the impacts of the ongoing trade disputes with China. 
China, a major soybean importer, has not placed an order with U.S. producers this year. Instead, the country has turned to Argentina for several shiploads of soybeans in a move similar to the country’s actions during the trade wars of the first Trump administration when China looked to Brazil for its soybeans.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday, though news reports from the weekend indicated the leaders have established a framework for a trade deal that includes purchases of agricultural materials. 
Resolving the trade dispute with China was a key request in the letter from congressional delegates Monday. 
“The United States should make soybean market access a central priority in trade discussions with China and work toward the suspension or removal of retaliatory duties that are distorting global competition,” the letter said. 
Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in a statement related to the letter that agriculture “prospers” when America can lead in global trade. 
“The longer trade tensions persist, the greater the damage of permanently weakening relationships with key markets—turning the U.S. into a secondary rather than preferred supplier of soybeans,” Adam said. 
Nunn said producers are “flying blind” and asking what the administration’s plan is to fix the situation. 
“Right now, bins are full, prices are underwater, and the ongoing government shutdown is adding even more uncertainty to an already tough situation,” Nunn said. “Iowa farmers deserve to compete on fair terms, and I look forward to hearing back from the administration.”

Calls for renewable fuels guidance 
In addition to a trade deal with China, the letter asks for finalization on 45z tax credit guidelines and renewable volume obligations, or RVOs, that industry leaders say will grow the renewable fuel industry and domestic demand for soybeans. 
“Agencies should work together to identify and expand alternative markets for soybeans and soybean meal, remove unnecessary barriers to trade, and deploy the full suite of tools to help U.S. farmers remain competitive,” the letter said. 
The 45z tax credit, which was initiated during the Biden administration and extended under the Republican-led “one big beautiful” law, encourages the production of low-emission biofuels, like sustainable aviation fuel. 
While the U.S. Department of the Treasury has released initial guidelines on the tax credit, the renewable fuel industry continues to call for finalized guidelines to produce fuels within the eligible emission ranges. 
Devin Mogler, the National Oilseed Processors Association president and CEO, said the soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion to expand capacity by more than 25% by selling into the biofuels industry. 
“But we need certainty on biofuels policy to ensure the industry can run at capacity, particularly coming off a record harvest,” Mogler said in a statement. “We greatly appreciate Congressman Nunn’s leadership in working with the administration to finalize strong RVOs and 45Z so these policies translate into value at the farmgate.”
Renewable volume obligations are part of the renewable fuel standards issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that establish standards for the quantities of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels. 
In June, the agency proposed historic standards for the industry, including a substantial jump in the amounts of biomass-based diesel standards, of which soybeans are a feedstock. 
The letter calls for these proposed rates to be finalized. 
Finally, lawmakers in the letter wrote that farmers need communication and a strategy from the administration in order to plan for the future. 
“We’ve appreciated the openness of the Administration to meet with stakeholders and hear their concerns,” the letter reads. “However, we’ve reached a point where our producers need clear signals, not continued uncertainty, to make informed marketing and planting decisions.”

(Eddie Moore/ABQ Journal)Democratic incumbents in New Mexico have large cash advantages against Republicans seeking to unseat them next year in the United States Congress, according to the latest campaign reports.
With more than a year until the Nov. 3, 2026 election, U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján has reported the most raised and the most left after expenses among the five-member delegation. His filings as of the end of September show $3.16 million on hand. 
No one has announced a run against Luján for his seat. The deadline to do so is Feb. 3, 2026. Fellow Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich is not up for re-election next year.

All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are on the November ballot. Among the three House seats that Democrats now hold in New Mexico, two Republican primaries are already shaping up. The primary will be held June 2, 2026.
In the 3rd Congressional District race, covering most of Northern and Northeast New Mexico, incumbent Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández is running against Republican Martin Zamora, who is currently the lone Republican in the race. He is also a state representative for House District 64. 
Zamora reports raising about $247,000 — the most of any Republican candidate for Congress in New Mexico — and spending a little more than $21,000 of it in the last reporting period. 
Leger Fernández, who is seeking her fourth term in Congress, reports more than $550,000 on hand.
In the 1st Congressional District, which covers the Albuquerque area, incumbent Rep. Melanie Stansbury’s opponent will be decided in the Republican primary. Steve Jones, a businessman, faces Ndidiamaka “Didi” Okpareke, a pharmacist. 
The 2nd Congressional District, which covers most of Southwest New Mexico, also has a Republican primary between Eddy Aragon, Jose Orozco and Greg Cunningham. The winner will face incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasque in a district that has historically been competitive for Democrats.
A Hobbs precinct has a 100% record in NM’s closest congressional race. Will it get it right again?

The 2nd Congressional District has flipped parties three times in the last decade and often draws millions in outside spending from both parties. Vasquez won 52% of the vote in the 2024 election against Republican challenger Yvette Herrell, in a race that election transparency website OpenSecrets tallied more than $15 million in outside spending. 
Herrell was elected to the seat in 2020, then lost it twice in subsequent races against Vasquez. She is currently Assistant Secretary of the Office of Congressional Relations at the United States Agriculture Department. 
  At the moment, Vasquez has almost $990,000 on hand. Among the three Republicans vying to face Vasquez in the primary, Aragon has raised the most, reporting about $4,300 on-hand, which is only a fraction of the warchest of the Democrat he hopes to face in the general election next November.

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)No National Guard troops can be sent to Portland before Tuesday evening, until all active judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decide whether to review a 2-1 decision made earlier this week that greenlit Trump’s ability to federalize the Oregon National Guard and deploy 200 troops to Portland.
The court late Friday afternoon paused any order allowing troop deployment until the 29 judges of the 9th Circuit — representing nine states and two territories — have finished voting on whether an “en banc” or “full court” review is warranted of a decision made Monday by two Trump appointed appellate judges.
In their majority opinion issued Monday, appellate judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade in essence handed the president unlimited power to call up National Guard troops whenever there is interference with federal functions, ruling that courts must defer to the president’s judgement and that it’s not up for judicial review.
The news that the Guard deployment would be administratively blocked by the 9th Circuit came hours after a U.S. District Court in Portland, Judge Karin Immergut, held a hearing to decide whether that 9th Circuit ruling on Monday voided one or both of the temporary restraining orders she has issued since early October barring National Guard deployment to Portland.
Immergut said Friday afternoon that she would have a decision “by Monday, if not before.” It’s likely the late Friday announcement from the higher court will delay any decision she makes.
Willamette University professor Norman Williams, a constitutional law expert, said the 9th Circuit rarely grants such fuller reviews, but Oregon has made a compelling case that the decision by Bade and Nelson was inconsistent with other court precedent. Granting a review would set off what would likely be several weeks of hearings and decision-making that would delay Oregon’s trial against the federal government that is scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court in Portland on Wednesday.
If the majority of the 29 agree to grant the review, they’ll immediately void Nelson and Bade’s decision and 11 judges of the court would be assigned to the review case. Ten would be selected at random and one would be the chief judge on the 9th Circuit, Mary Helen Murguia, previously a U.S. District Court Judge in Arizona appointed by former President Bill Clinton. Former President Barack Obama appointed Murguia to the 9th Circuit.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A district court judge in southwest Nebraska will let the state move forward with Gov. Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng, in a 17-page ruling Monday, ruled that Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, did not violate the Nebraska Constitution or state law by entering into a Sept. 30 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to convert the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook into a regional ICE detention center.
ICE certified the facility last week, Pillen announced Thursday. State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week. A hearing on the motion was held Friday, and the lawsuit will continue.
“It is clear that the current situation with the department and ICE detainees was never contemplated when the statutes were created, but the language utilized by the Legislature is broad enough to allow the defendants to take the action they have chosen,” Heng wrote.
Pillen and federal officials announced the Nebraska-ICE partnership Aug. 19. Jeffreys signed the contract on Sept. 30, which was released to the public Oct. 17, two days after the lawsuit was filed. 
A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office referred questions to the Governor’s Office, and Pillen’s office had no immediate comment. 
Nebraska Appleseed attorneys who filed the lawsuit Oct. 15 on behalf of 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, expressed disappointment that the court did not stop the changes.
In a statement, Robert McEwen, Appleseed’s legal director, said he was pleased that Heng had let the case keep moving forward.
“The case will carry forward from here, and we will continue to represent the interests of our clients in halting the activities of the defendants as they relate to the large-scale detainment camp in McCook.”
Schimek was one of the original lawmakers who authorized the creation of the state’s Work Ethic Camp in 1997. It opened in 2001. 
She and the taxpayers argued Pillen and Jeffreys were trying to “usurp” legislative authority by converting the McCook facility’s legislatively directed usage without first receiving legislative approval.
Heng overruled a state motion to dismiss the lawsuit — saying the taxpayers had a legal right to challenge the matter — but he denied a request to pause the state-federal partnership.
Heng also ruled that the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden of having the standing to sue, even as state attorneys for Pillen and Jeffreys had argued others might be better suited to challenge the action, such as the Legislature, displaced state inmates from the McCook facility or future federal detainees., he said the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden.
In denying the request for a temporary injunction, Heng pointed to the Nebraska Constitution’s requirement that the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions is done by the Legislature. His major question was whether the Legislature had delegated that authority.
“The answer is obviously, ‘yes,’” Heng wrote.
He pointed to the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and the authority of the governor to appoint a director, who then has general oversight of corrections oversight. Heng also ruled that Pillen and the executive branch have broad authority to enter contracts with the federal government.
“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued. “It has not done so here.”
To pause the Nebraska-ICE deal, Heng said the 14 taxpayers would have needed to show “irreparable harm,” probable success of succeeding on the merits and a balance of hardships in favor of the taxpayers over the government. Heng wrote that he was not yet convinced the plaintiffs were likely to succeed.
Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.
Heng said that while state law requires a work ethic camp, it doesn’t require one in McCook or Red Willow County. He said the location is a decision left to the corrections director, who has signed a sworn statement saying the rehabilitation offerings at the former McCook facility would be available at other state facilities.
“If there is not such a facility for qualified inmates,” Heng said, “that is not the subject matter of this lawsuit.”

(Photo provided by NOAA)As food prices rise and federal leaders revisit trade and nutrition policies, one solution has quietly been working for decades: Alaska’s commercial seafood industry. It is not only a pillar of our state’s economy, but also a strategic asset in strengthening America’s food security, trade competitiveness, and public health.
I’ve spent nearly 30 years working on Alaska’s waters. Today, as president of United Fishermen of Alaska, I represent thousands of harvesters and shore-based businesspeople whose livelihoods depend on clean, healthy oceans and fair access to markets. We know how much Alaska seafood contributes to this country—and how often it’s overlooked. While I speak mostly about Alaska seafood in this piece, most seafood from anywhere else in the United States is similarly beneficial, while being well-managed and held to stringent regulatory standards.
Alaska’s seafood industry generates more than $15 billion in annual economic output and supports over 81,000 U.S. jobs across fishing, processing, shipbuilding, logistics and more, including more than 23,000 captains and crew in Alaska alone. Alaska harvests nearly 5 billion pounds of wild seafood annually, producing more than all other U.S. states combined. It is the foundation of local economies in communities like Homer, Kodiak and Dillingham. Across the Lower 48, it fuels supply chains from grocery stores to restaurants to international exporters.
But while Americans eat more seafood than ever, up to 85% of it is imported according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—often from countries with weaker labor, environmental and food safety standards. Buying Alaska seafood is a direct investment in American jobs, values, and resource stewardship. Yet, at the same time, about two-thirds of Alaska’s wild seafood is exported internationally, rather than feeding Americans.
Beyond economics, Alaska seafood is one of the healthiest foods available. It’s high in protein, naturally low in saturated fat and free from additives or preservatives. Species like salmon, pollock, sablefish and sole are rich in vitamin D, B12, selenium and the powerful antioxidant astaxanthin.
Most notably, Alaska seafood is one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients support heart and brain health and are more bioavailable from seafood than from plant sources.  Yet 90% of Americans aren’t eating the recommended two servings of seafood per week, missing out on these essential nutrients. The FDA and EPA recommend pregnant and breastfeeding women consume seafood two to three times per week. All wild Alaska species such as salmon and pollock are listed among their “best” and “good” choices for low mercury contaminant levels.
America manages its fisheries better than any country in the world and Alaska takes it even a step further. Alaska was the first state to embed sustainable fisheries management into its constitution. Our stocks are managed using science-based strategies, annual quotas, ecosystem protections and strong enforcement. That means when people choose America and Alaska seafood, they’re not only choosing healthy protein but they are also supporting the long-term health of the ocean.
As policymakers debate how to strengthen domestic food security and improve public health, Alaska seafood must remain a priority. This means supporting trade access and public nutrition guidelines that reflect the health benefits of fish.  Supporting promotional and marketing programs at home and abroad would help educate Americans and those across the globe about Alaska seafood’s many benefits. For Alaska, it also means recognizing and protecting the working families and small businesses that make this industry possible.
Supporting Alaska seafood is not just about what’s on the dinner table. It’s about keeping American dollars in American communities, reducing reliance on imports, and preserving a resource that sustains our fishermen, our oceans and our bodies. For our economy, our health and our future, Alaska seafood is the smart choice.

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)The University of Northern Iowa is working to fast-track elementary teacher training through a new three-year degree program, with the goal of getting qualified educators out of college classrooms and into their own more quickly.
UNI announced in a news release it will launch a “Degree in 3” program in fall 2026 that will allow students to earn a bachelor of arts degree in elementary education in three years.
Provost José Herrera said in the release the new initiative “extends the reach” of the elementary education program — the largest major at the university — and upholds directives from the Iowa Legislature for each state university to offer at least one three-year degree program.

“UNI’s three-year degree is a bold response to the state’s demand for teachers and aligns very well with Iowa’s legislative objectives,” Herrera said in the release. “This builds on our legacy in teacher education while providing an alternative for today’s high school students seeking an accelerated path to elementary teaching.”
According to the release, the university expects between 25 and 30 incoming freshmen to make up the first cohort next fall. Of the nearly 2,000 students studying teaching at UNI, close to half choose to pursue elementary education.
Like the full, four-year degree program, the release stated students in the new track will take 120 credit hours to complete their degree, but spread across fall, winter, spring and summer semesters. They will also participate in “an array of in-depth clinical experiences and student teaching.”
Students ready for the more intense program will save time and tuition money compared to going through the traditional degree path, UNI College of Education Dean Colleen Mulholland said in the release. Fast-tracked students will be eligible for scholarships totaling $5,600, the release stated, for summer school tuition and student teaching stipends.
“The combination of less time on campus and added financial opportunities puts students an estimated $70,000 ahead in contrast to a traditional four-year path,” Mulholland said in the release. “We understand the commitment being made by these students, and pledge as well to offer dedicated year-around support in terms of academics, advising, career and wellness support.”

The Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) said Monday that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits will be suspended on Saturday. The suspension of the 100% federally-funded program comes on the 26th day of the government shutdown. Alabama DHR was notified of the suspension on Friday evening. 
“We know SNAP benefits are vitally important to the more than 750,000 Alabamians who depend on the more than $140 million in support each month. Alabama DHR, along with many others, hopes Congress will come to a quick resolution on the federal government shutdown,” Commissioner Nancy Buckner said.

The 750,000 Alabamians affected represent nearly 15% of the state population. Of that number, 330,000 (44%) are children, according to DHR.
DHR said in its Monday statement that Alabamians can still apply for SNAP, even though DHR will not be able to administer any benefits. Buckner also said the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) told her on Friday that it plans to reimburse state administrative costs for November. 
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Alabama, joined other House Democrats on Friday in urging Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to release SNAP contingency funds that Congress made available for situations like this, according to a release. Sewell said nearly a quarter of households in her district, which covers the western side of the Black Belt and parts of Birmingham, rely on SNAP.
“For so many, SNAP means the difference between a hot meal and going to bed hungry. The fact that President Trump and congressional Republicans would rather take food away from hungry families than work with Democrats to end this shutdown is shameful but not surprising,” Sewell said in a statement. “These are the same people responsible for making the largest cut to SNAP in American history less than four months ago.”
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Alabama officials were aware that federal funding for SNAP would reduce in fiscal year 2027, increasing the state’s share. According to estimates in August, the federal cuts to the program would increase DHR’s budget request by $35 million in FY27 and $208 million in FY28 when the state is responsible for 10% of SNAP benefits. 
The federal government shutdown is a dispute over health care. Republicans in Congress lack the votes to overcome a budget filibuster. Democrats say they want a bipartisan agreement to extend looming cuts in subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. Republicans said they won’t negotiate that until a stopgap spending bill is passed.

The rates for health care coverage purchased on HealthCare.gov in Wisconsin will rise by anywhere from 45% to 800% for 2026, depending on where a person lives, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday.
The increased rates will be made worse with the end of enhanced federal subsidies, provided in the form of tax credits, that have lowered insurance costs through the marketplace since 2021. The enhanced subsidies expire at the end of December, Evers and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) said during a virtual press conference Monday morning.
Clockwise from upper left, Reps. Gwen Moore and Mark Pocan, Gov. Tony Evers and Sen. Tammy Baldwin joined a virtual news conference Monday morning to discuss premium increases for policies purchased on HealthCare.gov under the Affordable Care Act. (Zoom Screenshot)
“In 2025, 88% of Wisconsinites [who] enrolled in coverage on HealthCare.gov qualify for tax credits, saving an average of $664 a month,” Evers said. “And without these enhanced tax credits, health care premiums for Wisconsinites are going to skyrocket, period. Many Wisconsinites will see their premiums double, and some of them will see staggering increases.”
Evers’ office distributed a press release Monday listing sample rate increases provided by the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance under a variety of scenarios that span different age groups, family sizes and incomes. Evers said a statewide average increase wasn’t available “because it’s going to impact lots of people in a lot of different ways.”
HealthCare.gov is the federal insurance marketplace, created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance access for people without health coverage from an employer or from government programs.
More than 310,000 Wisconsinites purchased health insurance through the marketplace for 2025, according to the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance.
Wisconsin residents looking to buy health insurance through the marketplace for 2026 will begin signing up Nov. 1 when open enrollment at HealthCare.gov begins.
Nationwide, some 22 million Americans will see their premiums double on average, Baldwin said. She cited projections that 4 million Americans “will look at that price tag and decide to drop their insurance altogether because it’s simply too expensive. It’s more than they can afford.”
KFF, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health policy news and analysis organization, reported Oct. 3 that seven out of 10 people nationally who buy health coverage through the federal marketplace said they would not be able to afford insurance without the enhanced subsidies.

Ned Lamont announced Monday the nomination of Christina Ghio as Connecticut’s new Child Advocate. 
Ghio has been serving as Acting Child Advocate since September 2024, when Sarah Eagan resigned from the position after serving in the role since 2013. Ghio joined Eagan in the Office of the Child Advocate as her deputy in 2022.
Ghio’s nomination for Child Advocate, a position charged with investigating state agencies that handle the care of Connecticut’s most vulnerable children as well as the deaths of children, comes at a time when the state is grappling with the shocking death of Jacqueline ‘Mimi’ Torres-Garcia, a child whose family was previously investigated by the Department of Children and Families.

The previous head of DCF, Jodi Hill-Lilly, announced that she was leaving the agency in August, and Lamont has yet to announce a nomination to permanently fill her post.
In a press release, Ghio said that she is grateful for the opportunity to serve as Child Advocate.
“So many children in Connecticut depend upon state systems to ensure that they are safe, receive an appropriate education and have access to the mental health care they need. It is the responsibility of the Office of the Child Advocate to shine a light on those systems, to constantly seek to improve them, and to give voice to our most vulnerable children,” Ghio said.
Lamont praised Ghio’s work and said she was “extraordinarily qualified” to take on the job. 
“I make this appointment at a time when we are all reminded by recent tragedies involving young people in our state of the vital role of this independent office, including its current investigation into the unconscionable circumstances surrounding the untimely death of Jacqueline ‘Mimi’ Torres-Garcia,” Lamont said in the press release. “As always, in addition to their own internal reviews, our state agencies are committed to providing information that will assist the child advocate in identifying recommended changes to laws, policies, and practices that will help prevent such tragedies from occurring again.”

Secretary of State Denny Hoskins must only correct a drafting error for his description of the initiative petition to be “concise, neutral and sufficient,” Judge Cotton Walker wrote.
The lawsuit, filed by attorney Duane Martin of the public education law firm EdCounsel, says the amendment seeks to “prohibit the use of state and local public funds for nonpublic schools for nondisabled students.”
Martin argued that Hoskins’ ballot summary contained several statements “that are unfair, insufficient or misleading.” Specifically, he pointed to the summary’s statement that the initiative petition would “eliminate existing programs that provide direct aid to students with special education needs by prohibiting the use of public funds for educational services provided by nonpublic schools.”
This is “misleading at best,” Martin wrote, since the amendment states that “public funds or public aid may be used to pay private individuals or entities for educational or other services to be provided to individuals with disabilities.”
Hoskins argues that the amendment is likely to upend MOScholars, the state’s K-12 scholarship program, which benefits nondisabled and disabled students.
“Even if the State could find workable statutory amendments or regulations to restrict the MOScholars program to comply with the proposed amendment, the program would be eliminated in its current form and need substantial alterations to comply with the proposed language,” wrote Andrew Crane, the deputy chief counsel for the attorney general’s office. 
Martin also disputes the characterization that the proposed amendment would “limit parental choice.” He wrote that the amendment wouldn’t eliminate nonpublic schools, so private education would continue to be available — though it wouldn’t be subsidized by the state.
“The only thing that would change is that public funds would not be used to pay the tuition of a nondisabled student, if the parent chooses to send their child to an in-person, private school,” he wrote.
Hoskins argues that limiting education to what parents can afford is indeed “limiting parental choice.”
“Limiting parental choice programs is a central aim of the proposed amendment and the first bullet point is necessary to properly inform voters on that point,” Crane wrote.
Walker didn’t get into the details of the debate over private school funding, but he wrote that Hoskins’ description “fairly and impartially states the purpose and probable effect of the proposed constitutional amendment.”
“Courts do not ask whether the secretary chose the best possible wording, only whether the language fairly and impartially summarizes the measure’s central purpose,” he continued in his five-page decision.
The only issue is a bullet point that says the amendment would “define most charter schools as nonpublic unless approved by voters or school boards before June 30, 2025.”
The proposed amendment would not change the status of charter schools operating prior to June 30. Only new charters would be considered nonpublic.
Walker’s ruling directs Hoskins to fix the “drafting error,” but otherwise upholds the other two contested bullet points.
Martin plans to appeal the decision, he told The Independent.
“We are disappointed in the decision, particularly in light of the plain language of the proposed amendment creating an exception for students with disabilities,” he said.
A court challenge of a separate pro-public-education petition is still pending.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Saving lives beyond the Heimlich,Krista Schultz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/saving-lives-beyond-the-heimlich/,When the conventional method for choking emergencies fails there is an opportunity for a life-saving backup intervention.,"In Trumbull, Connecticut a 10-month-old baby was saved by local police officer James Sota with the use of an anti-choking device. With the baby’s lips turning blue due to a blocked airway, the officer quickly retrieved a LifeVac kit. 
Officer Sota and the child’s parents were able to successfully clear part of the blockage from the child’s airway. By training and equipping officers with anti-choking devices, the Trumbull Police Department demonstrates what is possible. It also highlights why statewide policy is essential and every community deserves this life-saving option. 
According to the National Safety Council, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States. Among infants younger than one year, mechanical suffocation is the leading cause of preventable-injury death. 
The recommended response for children and adults has been the Heimlich maneuver which is a series of abdominal thrusts designed to dislodge the obstruction and prevent suffocation. In the event that the Heimlich maneuver is ineffective, what happens next? Many times it becomes a waiting game of continuing abdominal thrusts until medical personnel are able to assess the situation. 
What if there was another option for bystanders to a choking incident? When the conventional method fails there is an opportunity for a backup intervention such as an anti-choking suction device. 
The Heimlich works by pressing hard on the stomach and chest to push air out, while LifeVac uses suction to pull the blockage free. That difference gives rescuers another option, especially for babies, seniors, or anyone who can’t tolerate the force of abdominal thrusts. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made it clear that anti-choking devices such as the Dechoker and LifeVac are not FDA-approved and their effectiveness has not been fully established. The FDA cautions that using these devices first could even delay proven rescue techniques, since they often require unpacking and assembly before use. But with proper policies, training, and oversight the integration of these devices can be successfully implemented. 
Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are already required in many Connecticut schools, athletic facilities, and other community spaces. AEDs are a trusted standard for cardiac emergencies, and their mandate shows that Connecticut values life saving measures. Anti-choking devices should follow the same path. 
Texas recently enacted the Westyn Bryan Mandrell Act (HB 549), which requires every public school campus to keep at least one anti-choking device on hand. This would provide equipment in priority areas such as cafeterias and other areas where students eat. The law also ensures that staff receive training, that the devices are properly maintained, and that schools are able to use either state funding or community donations to cover costs. 
With successful implementation, Texas has offered a clear blueprint for how to bring these devices into schools statewide. Connecticut should take note and begin moving in the same direction to adapt policy ensuring these lifesaving anti-choking devices are available as a backup tool in emergency situations. 
In one controlled trial in a simulated environment, LifeVac was able to successfully remove the obstruction in 99% of attempts compared to abdominal thrust at 71%. The LifeVac was the most effective intervention when the Heimlich maneuver fails. Over 4,000 lives have been saved with the non-invasive airway clearance device LifeVac. 
It is known that choking is one of the leading causes of accidental death, and we already have the tools to prevent it. LifeVac devices are affordable, simple to use, and they work. Texas has already taken the step to put them in every school. Connecticut should do the same and go further by requiring them in nursing homes, restaurants, gyms, and other care facilities where people are most at risk. 
For the cost of a couple hundred dollars, schools and communities can be prepared to save a life. It’s a small investment with a huge return for a child, a parent, or a grandparent who gets to go home at the end of the day.

More than 275 North Carolinians have participated in the program since it was created last year, according to the governor’s office. Workers may be eligible if they have been “temporarily or permanently laid off” as a result of Helene.
A division within the North Carolina Department of Commerce will administer the money, partnering with five workforce development boards that span the entire western region of the state.
Stein has asked the federal government to send an additional $38 million for workforce support as part of a larger funding request to continue recovering from Helene.

(Photo by Getty Images)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined 22 other state attorneys general in sending a letter on Friday to Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pressing for answers on the lapse in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, coming at the end of the month. 
The state’s Department of Health and Human Services announced Thursday morning that they had been instructed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pause benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing federal shutdown. 
The letter “request[s] further clarification and information from USDA about (1) how it determined this action was necessary, and (2) its “contingency plan” to ensure benefits are issued to the maximum extent possible during the federal government shutdown.”
Specifically, it questions the legal basis of the benefits pause, as well as the implications of it — especially the federal government’s plan not to use contingency funds or to reallocate other funding sources to partially subsidize SNAP for November. 
“The Trump Administration should use all available funds to ensure SNAP benefits are not paused and be upfront about how they plan to move forward so Americans continue receiving the support they need during this time of uncertainty,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. 
The letter cited a $6 billion appropriation of emergency funds for SNAP funding — by most estimates, around two-thirds of what would be required to fully fund the program for November — and argues “USDA should surely use those funds to continue providing SNAP benefits, rather than effectively suspending all SNAP benefits by summarily ordering States to ‘hold’ already calculated November allotments.”
It also questioned the legality of the way that the department went about pausing the benefits, in that they did not cite their reasons for the pause beyond the federal shutdown — and whether it is a “cancellation” or a “suspension” of the November benefits, an important distinction under the law. 
“USDA does have some authority to reduce SNAP benefits, or even suspend or cancel them under certain circumstances,” the release from Nessel’s office said. “However, USDA’s October 10 letter does not indicate that any of the legal requirements to do so have been met.”
“In particular, rather than reducing November allotments consistent with statutory criteria, and requiring States to recalculate their files accordingly, USDA directed States to simply ignore the already-calculated November files altogether and effectively suspend SNAP benefits indefinitely,” the letter added.
The attorneys general also sent Rollins and the department a series of questions about the availability of contingency funds and whether or not the department intended to use them. However, the Department of Agriculture has said in a memo released Friday that they cannot legally use these contingency funds while the government is not funded — a rollback of previous statements from the department. 
Responses to those questions from Rollins were requested by the end of the day on Monday.

Free.,"Congressional Dems, Alaska’s Murkowski tell high court to nix emergency tariffs",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congressional-dems-alaskas-murkowski-tell-high-court-nix-emergency-tariffs,,"WASHINGTON — More than 200 Democratic lawmakers and one Republican are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down President Donald Trump’s sweeping global emergency tariffs.The 207 members of the U.S. House and Senate argued in an amicus brief late Friday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, does not authorize the president to unilaterally impose tariffs. The lawmakers urged the justices to agree with a lower court finding that Trump’s wide reaching import taxes triggered under IEEPA violate the Constitution, which grants duty powers to Congress.“IEEPA contains none of the hallmarks of legislation delegating tariff power to the executive, such as limitations tied to specific products or countries, caps on the amount of tariff increases, procedural safeguards, public input, collaboration with Congress, or time limitations,” the lawmakers wrote. “In the five decades since IEEPA’s enactment, no President from either party, until now, has ever invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs.” Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking members of the Senate committees on Foreign Relations and Finance, led the signatures of 36 members of the upper chamber. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, was the single GOP co-signer on the brief. A majority of House Democrats, 171 in total, also joined.The lawmakers filed the friend-of-the-court brief ahead of oral arguments scheduled before the Supreme Court next week on the question of whether Trump’s emergency tariffs are legal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in late August upheld a lower court ruling striking down the administration’s IEEPA tariffs.The Senate is expected to vote on three bills this week that aim to terminate Trump’s import taxes on products from Canada, Brazil and any other country subject to emergency duties.Fentanyl, trade deficits as emergenciesTrump began imposing tariffs under IEEPA in February and March on China, Canada and Mexico, declaring these countries responsible for illegal fentanyl smuggling into the U.S. The president escalated the emergency tariffs over the following months on goods from around the globe, declaring trade deficits a national emergency. A trade deficit means the U.S. imports more goods from a country than that nation purchases from U.S. suppliers.Domestic businesses and purchasers now pay the U.S. government anywhere from 10% to 50% in tariffs on most imported products. The government had collected $195 billion this year in customs duties at the end of September, according to a U.S. Treasury monthly statement.State AGs and businesses launched court challengeSeveral private businesses and a dozen states sued Trump over the use of the emergency statute to trigger the steep import taxes.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states, led by Democratic state attorneys general, that brought the suit.Businesses that sued the Trump administration include the lead plaintiff, V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, according to its website. Other plaintiffs include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled Trump’s tariffs under IEEPA illegal in late May.",,,,2025-10-27 12:04:26.562239

Matt Maddock (R-Milford) testify before the House Economic Competitiveness Committee. Oct. 23, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMembers of the Michigan House Economic Competitiveness Committee filed into their meeting room last Thursday to examine a widespread package of policies that proponents say would help cut down on red tape in various fields, including architecture, health, engineering, surveying, barbering and personnel. 
While the bills discussed tweaking or eliminating licensure requirements for certain fields and relaxed ownership requirements for engineering, architecture and professional surveying firms, state Rep. Matt Maddock’s (R-Milford) House Bill 4915 stood out in seeking to bar the state from requiring health professionals to undergo implicit bias training as a condition for receiving or renewing their license. 
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 issued an executive directive, instructing the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs to develop these requirements for health professionals following recommendations from the Michigan Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities, which advised the state on how to address the higher rate of COVID-19 deaths among Black Michiganders.
The directive calls out the health disparities Black, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans experience compared to white and Asian Americans, as well as the disparities between women and men, noting that women are more likely to receive a delayed diagnosis of heart disease than men, as well as inferior treatment for heart attacks. 
The directive acknowledges these disparities are numerous and complex, and can be tied to other determinants of health like education, employment and environmental factors, pointing to implicit bias – or thoughts and feelings that exist outside of conscious awareness – as another potential contributor to these disparities.

While the institution of these requirements was intended to help eliminate unconscious biases, misconceptions and stereotypes that may impact health professionals’ behavior, members of Do No Harm – a national organization which opposed diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in health care, as well as gender-affirming care for minors – argued the training requirements are divisive and encourage bias. 
“Implicit bias trainings teach participants to focus on another person’s immutable characteristics in order to counter their own presumed unconscious feelings and use these observations to make decisions,” said Aida Cerundolo, an emergency medicine physician and senior fellow at Do No Harm. “In the medical context this means doctors must judge patients on their superficial attributes and make clinical decisions not solely on objective facts and data, but also on skin color and other immutable characteristics. This is called discrimination. It is dangerous, it is unethical and it is wrong.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Kurt Miceli, the organization’s medical director, argued the training requirements also diverts time and resources away from continued medical education, suggesting health professionals’ time would be better spent reviewing medical literature on how to treat comorbid medical conditions. 
Miceli further argued that the training requirement places an undue burden on health providers and will only frustrate Michigan’s shortage of health care providers. 
Miceli’s testimony was greeted warmly by Republicans with state Rep. Pat Outman (R-Six Lakes) saying he’d had several health providers ask him to remove the implicit bias training requirements, and that other providers were walking away at the tail end of their career because of these additional licensing requirements.
According to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, health professionals applying for a new license must complete two hours of implicit bias training, while applicants who are renewing must complete one hour of training for each year in their licensing or registration cycle.
Democratic members of the committee had questions about the bill, with the committee’s minority vice chair, Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids) asking Miceli whether he believed racial disparities were present in health care, and how they should be addressed. 
“There are disparities in health care, and we can always continue to do better,” Miceli said. “And I think our emphasis would be better focused on, what can we do to address things like diabetes or hypertension or different sorts of illnesses that are impacting folks in negative ways? And if we direct our attention towards those, I think we’ll be doing a much better job in educating our workforce.”
Danielle Atkinson, the executive director of Mothering Justice, a multi-state organization focused on supporting mothers of color, submitted a card in opposition to the bill, but did not speak at Thursday’s hearing. 
While Miceli pushed for a focus on clinical issues to resolve disparities in health care, Atkinson told the Michigan Advance Friday that health professionals need to look at this issue holistically, incorporating psychological and social perspectives.
“I think our physicians are well trained around the physiological aspects of health disparities, but what we are lacking is a complete whole body, whole mind and whole community approach, which includes understanding implicit bias,” Atkinson said.

While Miceli and Cerundolo questioned the validity of studies into implicit bias, Atkinson noted that in study after study, people of color are treated differently in medical settings. 
“They’re prescribed differently. Their drug treatment is different. They are perceived to be more tolerant of pain, and they’re not believed as frequently as their white counterparts,” Atkinson said. 
Atkinson also shared her own experience, noting that communicating with health care providers differs depending on whether she’s speaking with someone who shares her cultural background. 
She also pointed to the disparity in maternal mortality rates, with Black women dying from maternal health complications at three times the rate of white women. 
“We know that our bodies are not different. So there’s other things. There’s sociological factors at play that we have to be really curious about,” She said. “And when scientists are pointing to this implicit bias, we need to pay attention.”

(Jill Hummels for the Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Blueberries unpicked and dropping from plants in New Jersey, crops left to dry up in North Carolina fields and understaffed rural Kansas cattle operations are becoming more and more common, and food in the United States is going to waste, according to farmers and agriculture professionals.
It is happening in large part because of a labor shortage crisis, they said during a Thursday press call hosted by a coalition called Grow It Here that brought together the topics immigration, government and farming.
“It is clear to me that we can either import our workers or import our food, and that’s a key question, a key issue we need to answer,” said Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, representing around 5,000 members involved in Kansas’ multi-billion dollar cattle industry.
Farmers from North Carolina, Wisconsin, California and New Jersey also weighed in, expressing their frustrations with labor challenges and describing their reliance on a federal guest worker visa program that can act as a band-aid to larger issues. The program is often framed as a win-win for employers and workers, but that isn’t always the case.
Brandon Batten of Triple B Farms in Four Oaks, North Carolina, said his farm began using the federal government’s H-2A visa program about a year ago. The program allows employers who meet certain requirements to hire foreign workers for temporary jobs while providing a mandated base wage and housing. Recent changes to the program increased application and processing fees and stripped worker protections.
Labor has been Batten’s biggest challenge, he said, and while H2A provides a safety net, it isn’t always efficient.
“As expensive and onerous as the program is, it’s more expensive to plant a crop and not get it harvested,” he said.
Cattle operations often cannot use the visa program. The jobs aren’t seasonal, so Teagarden said rural Kansas employers are trying to take a holistic approach by recruiting locally, sometimes visiting high schools to encourage fulfilling careers in agriculture and trying to retain existing workers.
John Rosenow owns a 700-cow dairy farm in western Wisconsin that employs 18 people. Thirteen of them are from Mexico, he said. But he cannot use the H-2A program.
“The dairy industry has been asking Congress and asking the federal government for years to modernize the immigration system because dairy is specifically excluded from having H-2A employees,” he said. “We rely on immigrants.”
He said 90% of dairy harvested from Wisconsin cows is done so by immigrants.
Brandon Raso, a fourth-generation blueberry farmer in New Jersey, started using the H-2A program more than a decade ago.
“Aside from its challenges, logistically, and its costs, it’s been a program that has helped us stay afloat,” Raso said. “But I do have to admit, due to the rising costs and increasing challenges that the program has provided, we have dramatically decreased the number of workers we utilize through that program.”
The farm used to have 250 workers through the H-2A program to help offset local labor shortages, Raso said. This season, the farm had 30 workers.
Historically, New Jersey farmers could produce about 60 million pounds of blueberries each season, or about $140 million, Raso said. This year, it was around 36 million pounds. Raso attributes the primary cause of the decrease to labor shortages.
“I know, myself, we left about two million pounds on our farm on our plants to fall off and hit the ground because there was just no one to get that fruit,” he said.
About 70% of crop farm workers in the U.S. are foreign-born, said Zach Rutledge, a professor and economist at Michigan State University. Most of those workers are from Mexico, and about 41% are not authorized to work in the U.S.
About half of farmers say they don’t have the labor they need, Rutledge said, and they gauge their shortage at lacking 21% of needed workers. He said that labor reductions result in production and revenue reductions for farmers. Current trends could lead to billions in lost revenue, an increase in food prices and a heavier reliance on imports, he said.
He added that if immigration enforcement targets agriculture, “there could be major problems.”
“Including the direct effects of having arrests and deportations of workers on the farm and what we call chilling effects, which are when workers get scared because they hear about immigration enforcement and don’t go to work because of fear of being deported,” Rutledge said.
Employers face significant burdens under the federal H-2A program.
So do l employees.
“On top of increased immigration enforcement, which is already exacerbating a chilling effect among workers facing abuse, from the start of the Trump administration, we’ve seen sustained efforts to roll back hard-earned worker protections,” said Jimena de Haro of the Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, a binational workers’ rights organization.
The Trump administration has reversed Biden-era protections for workers under H-2A rules and proposed at least $17.29 billion in wage cuts for H-2A workers over 10 years.
The administration’s deportations and efforts to strip people in the U.S. of their immigration and work authorization statuses exacerbate labor shortages, de Haro said.
“In response, we are seeing growers and lawmakers coming up with ‘Band-Aid solutions’ to increase the number of available workers — mainly focused on expanding guest worker programs— without taking into account workers’ wellbeing or rights,” de Haro said.
Recent proposals, also mentioned on the Grow It Here call, include pushes to make H-2A year-round and make it available to other industries, she said.
“But in a program rife with abuse, expanding it would just cause more abuse and exploitation of migrant farmworkers, especially when calls for expansion are accompanied by the rollback of important worker protections,” she said.
A report by Centro called “Ripe for Reform” and a September investigation by ProPublica showed the H-2A program as prone to worker abuse and exploitation.
Kristi Boswell, a former agriculture labor advisor during the first Trump administration and advisor to Grow It Here, said the campaign was created to educate policymakers and the public about labor shortage struggles and the repercussions that come as a result.
The word “crisis” was used several times by the group.
“I’ve been working on this issue for 15 years,” Boswell said. “The situations, the circumstances, have worsened. Labor costs have increased. We’ve seen a trade deficit in specialty crops and fruits and vegetables. I think it is going to continue to elevate.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cattle-feedlot-scaled-edit-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-27 11:17:07.437014

Carolyn Ann Berry Dermody, age 89, of Addison, Vermont, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, October 22, 2025.
She was born on September 28, 1936, in Burlington, Vermont, to James and Constance Berry. Ann grew up in Vergennes, where she attended Vergennes High School and later graduated from Trinity College in Burlington. She went on to earn her master’s degree from National Louis University later in life.
Ann cherished her Vermont upbringing — from skating between fish shanties in the winter to endless summer days on Lake Champlain. She often shared joyful stories of outdoor adventures with her father and fun times with her mother.
In her adult life, Ann dedicated herself to educating and empowering women through her career in adult education. She developed and led programs in Washington, D.C., Alaska, Oklahoma, and ultimately spearheaded the CETA Job Training Program, which became part of Waubonsee Community College in Aurora, Illinois. Her program was later recognized as a national “Point of Light” under the Bush Administration. In 1991, Ann was honored as Trinity College’s Alumna of the Year, receiving the Distinguished Alumna Achievement Award. Her lifelong dedication to helping others changed countless lives — a truth reflected in the letters she continued to receive from former students well into her 80s. She was a compassionate and determined leader who loved making a difference in the world around her.
While attending Trinity College, Ann met an airman named Jim — and together they built a remarkable life. They enjoyed successful careers, adventures across the country and abroad, and a joyful family life raising their two children, Kim and Kevin. Ann and Jim spent nearly three decades of retirement traveling between her favorite place on earth, Lake Champlain, and their warm-weather home in Flagler Beach, Florida. She loved hosting family at the lake, baking Fourth of July cupcakes for her grandsons, and enjoying time surrounded by loved ones. Ann also found great joy in her bridge clubs, reading, and taking in the beauty of her beloved lake and ocean views. A lifelong dog lover, she leaves behind her faithful companion, Micky.
Ann is survived by her daughter, Kim (Joe) Butzen, her son, Kevin (Colleen) Dermody, and her grandsons: Sean, Ryan, Kevin, and Connor. She was preceded in death by her parents, James and Constance Berry, and her husband, James Dermody.

Larry Rhoden, points toward the property line of land in rural Lincoln County that had been surveyed for the purpose of constructing a men's prison. (Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s governor and lawmakers put more than two years of debate behind them recently with a decision to build a prison, but there’s more than rhetoric in the rearview. 
They’re also leaving behind more than $20 million.
That’s how much unrecoverable money the state spent on a rural Lincoln County prison site before the Legislature rejected it in February over concerns about the location and the project’s $825 million cost. Those concerns — and opposition that included a lawsuit from neighboring Lincoln County landowners — led the Legislature and governor to approve a different plan last month for a $650 million prison in Sioux Falls.
South Dakota lawmakers approve $650 million prison construction project in Sioux Falls

By that time, the executive branch under the leadership of former Gov. Kristi Noem and her successor Gov. Larry Rhoden had already spent or obligated $52.7 million on the Lincoln County plan, from an incarceration construction fund lawmakers had been filling up for several years. The expenditures covered an array of costs, ranging from design work and contracts for infrastructure installation to everyday expenses such as herbicide application and travel. 
In the process of working out an alternative plan, Rhoden’s office said it was able to claw back more than half of that money for use in the prison project on Benson Avenue in Sioux Falls.
South Dakota Searchlight used an itemized spreadsheet from Rhoden’s office and searched the state’s database of contracts to piece together where the sunk costs landed at the Lincoln County site. 
The figures listed below account for around $20.4 million in wasted money, but not an additional $10 million in federal funding the state directed to the city of Lennox for wastewater treatment plant upgrades to service the Lincoln County site. That money had to be used for infrastructure under federal rules, and spent by the end of 2024. The upgrades will still happen, and although the state Department of Corrections won’t benefit from them, the growing city of Lennox will, so the Rhoden administration argues that’s not wasted money.
Partial losses
Nelco: $10.2 million
Nelco, a Minneapolis architecture firm, produced designs for the Lincoln County facility, at a cost of $24.7 million. The state was able to reuse $14.5 million worth of those designs for the Benson Road site. 
Land swap: $3.4 million
The state valued the Lincoln County land at $7.9 million as a prison site. It transferred that amount from its incarceration construction fund to the school trust fund managed by the Office of School and Public Lands to obtain the 320 acres on which the Lincoln County prison would’ve sat. The land had passed into the office’s possession years ago when the owners died without heirs or a will.
After abandoning its plan to put a prison on the site, the state valued the land at $4.5 million for agricultural purposes. The difference — $3.4 million — is considered a loss. 
But the Rhoden administration considers the $4.5 million of ag value to be recovered, because the land was swapped at that value for the Sioux Falls site, in a deal that also included the state paying $12.5 million. 
JE Dunn/Henry Carlson: $1.5 million
These two companies, headquartered in Kansas City and Sioux Falls, respectively, are partnered as the state’s construction manager at-risk, which acts as a consultant before building and the general contractor once building begins. By the time lawmakers voted to endorse the Benson Road site, the state had paid the team a total of $3.14 million. Of that, $1.5 million was work specific to the Lincoln County site.
Tegra: $340,000
This Twin Cities-area company was hired as an owner’s representative. Its job is to oversee a construction project with an eye to the best interests of the client. It worked with the Office of the State Engineer to coordinate the project, doing things like overseeing project milestones and deliverables, investigating how long it might take to get construction materials, and reviewing and delivering proposals and estimates for various tasks. Of the $540,000 of work the company completed for the Lincoln County site, the state was able to reuse $200,200 for Benson Road.

Soukup Construction: $212,340
The state hired Soukup, of Sioux Falls, to prepare the Lincoln County land for construction and the sewer piping that would have connected the Lincoln County prison to Lennox. The contract for that work, signed Dec. 2, 2024, was for $3.7 million. 
Between payments and pending invoices, Soukup did $503,380 worth of that contract’s work in Lincoln County before a stop work order was issued.
Rhoden’s office said $291,040 of the sewer piping and casings, now being stored in Sioux Falls, can be used for the Benson Road prison.
Office of State Engineer: $147,722
The office of Stacy Watters, state engineer, did about $352,000 of work on the Lincoln County site. Of that, the state will reuse about $204,000. Gov. Rhoden’s office told South Dakota Searchlight that a majority of that money represented labor costs paid to engineers within the state office working on the project.
Bureau of Information and Telecommunications: $41,036
This line item is listed as IT Development Services. Rhoden’s office said much of that expense is tied to an information technology project manager for the new prison’s security systems. “Much of that will be reused,” Rhoden’s office said, but the exact amount hasn’t been calculated.
Total losses
South Lincoln Rural Water: $1.58 million
The state paid $1.58 million of what was to be a $3.15 million agreement for South Lincoln Rural Water to deliver water to a tower that would’ve served the Lincoln County prison through 2044. The water system would’ve owned and maintained the tower.
The purchase agreement from Aug. 27, 2024, required half the money to be paid upfront. Rhoden’s office told Searchlight the payment was meant to get the system moving on the upgrades it needed to have done in order to service the prison on the state’s construction schedule (the prison was meant to open in 2029).
As with the federal money paid to Lennox, the money will be used for upgrades that will benefit local customers.
Sayre Associates: $738,905
Governor announces $17 million deal for Sioux Falls prison site, subject to legislative approval

The state paid this Sioux Falls firm to design the wastewater infrastructure that would’ve been used to connect the Lincoln County prison to Lennox.
East River Electric: $250,000
The state paid a quarter million dollars to this cooperative for a stake in a new electric substation meant to allow for the delivery of electricity to the Lincoln County site. The total estimated cost of the state’s stake in the substation was $4 million, according to a purchase agreement signed on Aug. 6, 2024. The $250,000 payment was the amount payable “upon execution of this agreement.” The state has released its stake in the substation, according to Rhoden’s office.
Southeastern Electric: $153,000
Southeastern was meant to provide power to the Lincoln County prison. To secure access to electricity, the state paid Southeastern $153,000. It’s unclear how much the state was set to pay the cooperative for power. The rate schedule is blacked out in the publicly available contract between the state and the co-op, dated Nov. 22, 2024.
Burns & McDonnell: $173,200
This Kansas City firm was used to commission the prison’s mechanical, electrical, lighting, security and other systems. Commissioning is meant to verify that such systems are designed as ordered prior to construction, and installed as designed afterward. Because the mechanical system is changing for the new building, this work will need to be redone, Rhoden’s office said.
Geotek: $100,300
The state paid Geotek, of Stewartville, Minnesota, $100,300 to prepare the Lincoln County site for dirt moving, testing and monitoring. It also did preparatory testing work for the land where the sewer line from the Lincoln County site to Lennox would’ve been built.
Steffl Drilling and Pump: $82,500
Steffl’s contract asked the Willmar, Minnesota, company to “install three 500-foot deep wells with 1.25 inch piping and thermally enhanced grout” by Aug. 30, 2024. The wells were installed in May 2024, Rhoden’s office said.
Geothermal Resource Technologies: $12,000
This Elkton company was meant to use the three wells dug by Steffl to test the viability of geothermal heating and cooling at the prison site.
Lincoln County Title Company: $13,680
This company sold the state title insurance on the Lincoln County land, plus title reporting fees.
State lost $21 million on failed Lincoln County prison site, governor’s office says

Property taxes: $11,973
The 320 acres in Lincoln County cost the state $11,973 in property taxes across two years, 2024 and 2025. The land was taxed as agricultural. The state typically doesn’t pay property taxes, but the Lincoln County land was operated under a unique, decades-old crop sharing agreement, which had been leased for agricultural use. The land has not been in production since 2023, but the Department of Corrections paid the property tax bills after it obtained the land. The property now belongs to the family that sold South Dakota the Benson Road land on which the new Sioux Falls prison will be built.
Travel reimbursement: $12,206
The state Department of Transportation spent $12,206 to reimburse its employees for travel-related expenses tied to work done to prepare the Lincoln County prison project. The largest travel expense, according to Rhoden’s office, was a trip to Utah to tour a correctional facility in that state.

In July, the state paid this company to spray herbicides on the Lincoln County land, which had been rented to farmers but had gone unplanted for two seasons.
Project Prison Reset costs
After the Legislature shot down the $825 million Lincoln County prison plan, Rhoden convened a task force to study the state’s prison needs, and to decide on the appropriate size and site for any new prisons it deemed necessary. The group landed on the Benson Road site approved by lawmakers during the special session in September. Task force costs were paid out of the state’s incarceration construction fund.
Arrington Watkins: $872,194
This Arizona-based consulting firm did an assessment of Department of Corrections facilities, population trends, and future needs on behalf of the Project Prison Reset task force. The firm essentially redid and updated the work performed by a consultant group called DLR three years ago, but did so in a few months. The firm also looked at proposed prison sites that emerged during the task force process, which added another $140,000 to the cost of its consulting work. 
Travel cost reimbursements: $30,730
The Department of Corrections paid $27,155 to cover the travel of the 22 members of the Project Prison Reset task force. There were two meetings in Sioux Falls, where a dozen of the group’s members live, and two others, in Pierre and Springfield. The Department of Transportation paid $3,575 to pay for the travel of the state employees involved in the task force.
South Dakota Veterans Alliance: $4,494
The task force’s first and last meetings were held at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance facility in Sioux Falls, located on Russell Street near Howard Wood Field and the Denny Sanford Premier Center. The money paid for use of the facility and food for task force members.
TKOs Custom Catering: $350

Greenwich, Connecticut
Died May 7, 2025
East Hardwick, Vermont
Details of services
A memorial was held at Bread & Puppet on July 6 where hundreds of friends, colleagues and family gathered from near and far to celebrate a life well-lived, but far too short.

Meredith Holch, 64, died suddenly while working in her yard in East Hardwick, VT on May 7, 2025. The cause of death was complications from polycythemia vera, a rare blood disorder.
Born and raised in Greenwich, CT she was a daughter of the late Arthur and Ellen Holch, and the sixth of seven siblings. A graduate of Greenwich High School, she earned a BA in French and Public Policy from Duke University (Magna Cum Laude), and received a MFA in Film/Video from Bard College.
An award-winning film maker specializing in stop-motion animation and video, Meredith’s work, which has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC and PBS TV, centers on socially and politically relevant themes and local Vermont history. She was the recipient of two MacDowell artists colony resident fellowships in 2004 and 2009, and one at Millay Arts in 2011.

In early 2025, Meredith completed her final film “Brother Bird,” a moving trilogy about death and reincarnation symbolized through birds and nature, with a segment inspired by her late brother Chris. It was named Best Animated Film at the Made Here Film Festival (MHFF) co-produced by the Vermont International Film Festival and Vermont Public just weeks before her death.
In her 20s and throughout her life, Meredith performed and toured with Bread & Puppet Theater in Glover, VT, thriving on its community of artists, musicians and performers, many of whom became lifelong friends and collaborators. She later settled in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, and was an active and charismatic presence in her community.
Channeling her boundless energy into a variety of jobs and projects in the area over the years, Meredith served as Executive Director of Hardwick Community Public Access TV, worked at the Vermont Council on Aging, organized and taught animation workshops for kids and started a house painting business—to name a few. One of her many creative claims to fame among her vast network of friends was entering the annual Pumpkin Carving Contest in Barton, VT every year and invariably winning with her imaginative creations.
A doer, motivator, creator and adventurer, Meredith will be best remembered as upbeat, outspoken and confident, with a remarkable drive to excel at anything she did—from planting vegetables or learning the fiddle, to writing a novel or being there for family and friends when they needed her—she tackled everything with tenacity.
Predeceased by her parents, brother, a brother-in-law and niece, she is survived by her siblings and their spouses: Gregory, Hilary O’Neill, Milissa (Rick) Laurence, Jeremy (Tanya), and Allegra as well as 3 nieces and 3 nephews.

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)More senior staff changes are coming to Gov. Wes Moore’s team.
Moore will announce Monday that Maryland Department of Service and Civic Innovation Secretary Paul Monteiro will leave the position he has held since 2023. He will be replaced by Jonny Dorsey, who takes over as the second secretary of the department created under Moore.
The department and the service year program were signature programs for Moore during his first year in office. Details about Monteiro’s departure were limited Monday.
Dorsey, who has served as one of Moore’s deputy chiefs of staff since 2023, will take over as acting secretary on Nov. 12. He will also continue to serve as a senior adviser to Moore.
“Jonny has been the driving force behind many of my most important initiatives,” said Moore said in a statement. “He helped design and launch four new executive offices and departments, including the Department of Service and Civic Innovation, which he will now lead. He forged partnerships that delivered more than $100 million in new resources to Maryland, and guided key policy efforts making a difference for our communities.

“Throughout, he has stewarded impact, innovation, and improvement across eleven agencies and issues representing two-thirds of the state budget,” Moore’s statement said. “Jonny’s leadership, creativity, and commitment have been central to our progress, and I am confident he will advance this department’s mission. I am also grateful he will continue to lead cross-government partnerships, strategic initiatives, and other crucial efforts as a Senior Advisor.”
The moves are the latest in a series that has seen more than a half dozen Cabinet secretaries leave Moore’s administration in advance of his 2026 reelection bid.
The changes also come as Lester Davis begins his tenure as Moore’s second chief of staff. He replaced Fagan Harris, who continues as an advisor to Moore but is set to join the Abell Foundation as the next president and CEO of the Baltimore philanthropic organization. Fagan takes the new position after the first of the year.

Photo courtesy of Lynn Blasey.Lynn Blasey, a two-time city council candidate for Hamtramck, is now running to be the city’s mayor as a write-in. 
After coming in fourth in 2023, an election marred by scandal after two sitting councilmembers were charged with election fraud felonies, Blasey had said she would not run again — until she was approached by some fellow residents who urged her to seek the mayoral seat instead. 
“There’s a lot of people who are just frustrated with all of the fraud happening in Hamtramck, and many people didn’t intend to vote. I was on the fence about voting,” she said. “I’ve talked to people that said they were going to do a protest vote and send in a blank ballot.”
“So after talking it over with some residents, I chose to run as a write-in candidate for mayor to keep people engaged in politics,” she added, noting statistics that show after skipping one election, they often continue to not vote. 
Running as a write-in candidate is an uphill battle, Blasey noted. Some voters are not aware of how to properly fill out a ballot for a write-in — having to both write the name and fill in the circle on the ballot. 
“You have to let people know that you’re a choice,” she said. “They need to know how to spell your name and where to put your name. So it’s definitely a lot more challenging.”
With two write-in candidates for city council — Joe Strzalka and Diane Elizabeth Frkan — Blasey said she does not think that this many write-ins have ever run in multiple elections before. That’s why, for Blasey, her main goal in the campaign is to keep people engaged.

“If I can convince 300-500 people to write my name on the ballot and to stay engaged, that would be a huge victory for me, because otherwise most of the people voting for me weren’t going to vote at all,” she said. 
Candidates whose names will appear on the ballot include Adam Alharbi and Muhith Mahmood, who are seeking to become Hamtramck’s next mayor, as well as Nayeem L. Choudhury, Motahar Fadhel, Abdulmalik Kassim, Abu A. Musa, Yousuf Saed and Luqman Saleh, who are competing for the three open council seats.
Blasey is also the only woman in the race, as well as an openly queer candidate in a Muslim-majority city that has previously banned pride flags on city property. While her family has lived in Michigan for generations, for Blasey it’s more important to show her dedication to the city. 
“I feel like people who know me and have seen my engagement in the city over the years believe I’m a strong candidate no matter what,” she said.
However, if she were to win, one of her main areas of focus is making the city’s various boards and commissions more effective. 
“Over the years, going to city council meetings, observing the nomination process under two different mayors, it seems like it’s often political favors and not necessarily identifying people who even understand what boards and commissions are and what their responsibilities and expectations are,” she noted. 
Blasey, the vice chair of the Hamtramck arts and culture commission, said that many of the boards and commissions are ineffective or even inactive because meetings are cancelled or underattended. 
“Really getting people engaged, identifying those people, helping them understand what they’re signing up for before they sign up for it,” she said of her goal. “I think we can be a lot more efficient as a city if we get the right people in those spots.”

Brandywine Reading Specialist Jenna DiEleuterio earns the 2026 Teacher of the Year award.
By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Journalist Delaware Live | October 2025
A middle school reading specialist from the Brandywine School District has earned Delaware’s 2026 State Teacher of the Year, receiving the state’s highest honor for classroom excellence. Jenna DiEleuterio of Talley Middle School was named the 2026 State Teacher of the Year during a ceremony in Dover, where Secretary of Education Cindy Marten made the announcement. DiEleuterio now serves as Delaware’s nominee for National Teacher of the Year.
With 15 years of teaching experience, DiEleuterio has dedicated her career to helping students build a positive relationship with literacy by providing meaningful learning experiences that promote deep thinking, build knowledge, and equip them to succeed in life.
Middle school, DiEleuterio explained, is a uniquely formative time in a student’s life. “Students at this age start to realize their opportunities and their responsibilities, and become more curious about the world, and there is a different level of engagement,” she said. “It is also a very vulnerable and sometimes awkward time, and I truly appreciate the opportunity to be part of that process. The middle school years can be hard, and it is an honor to walk alongside students during that stage of their lives.”
As a reading specialist, DiEleuterio said that connection always comes first because it is essential to learning. “When my students walk into the classroom, I can often tell if something is going on,” she said. “I take the time to talk with them, help them problem solve or process what they are feeling, and meet them where they are so we can get them to where the learning happens.”
DiEleuterio is also known for her leadership beyond the classroom. She serves as the facilitator and pioneer of the Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) team at Talley Middle School and throughout Brandywine’s secondary schools, bringing educators together to analyze data, evaluate interventions, and ensure instruction is tailored to meet the needs of every student.
“By leveraging additional data and progress monitoring systems, Dr. DiEleuterio has implemented highly targeted interventions not only in her classroom but across all intervention groups in the building,” said Brandywine Supervisor of Special Education Katherine Siegel. “She personally collects data when needed and provides instructional materials and professional development sessions to staff implementing interventions.”
DiEleuterio said her ability to lead and support others is grounded in meaningful relationships and intentional self-care. “I rely on strong relationships at school and on colleagues I can talk with and bounce ideas off of for both professional and emotional support,” she said. “I also take care of myself physically and mentally. I am intentional about resting, taking walks, spending time in nature, and going to therapy to stay grounded and balanced.”
By action of the General Assembly, DiEleuterio will receive a five thousand dollar grant to use for the educational benefit of her students, as well as two personal grants totaling an additional five thousand dollars. The remaining nineteen district and charter honorees each will receive a personal grant of two thousand dollars. All twenty teachers also received gifts from Wilmington University, Advantech Incorporated, and their district superintendents or the Delaware Charter Network. DiEleuterio also received gifts from the Delaware School Boards Association, Delaware State Education Association, and Delaware State Teachers of the Year Association; State of Delaware Teacher of the Year commemorative plates from the Division of Motor Vehicles; a full doctorate program from University of Delaware and Wilmington University; and a ten karat gold ring from Jostens. This year’s celebration was sponsored by Voya Financial.
DiEleuterio earned her Bachelor of Science in elementary and special education from Elizabethtown College before graduating from Wilmington University with a Master of Education in reading and a Doctor of Education in teacher leadership. The award of a full doctorate program builds on her professional journey and reflects her commitment to advancing literacy and leadership at the highest level. That commitment to both students and the profession is what DiEleuterio will now carry forward on a statewide stage.
As the new State Teacher of the Year, DiEleuterio will represent Delaware educators statewide and address community groups, business leaders, legislators, and educational organizations to inform the public about the status of Delaware schools. She also becomes Delaware’s candidate in the National Teacher of the Year Program, a project of the Council of Chief State School Officers.
Reflecting on the honor, DiEleuterio said her greatest hope is to leave a lasting impact on both students and educators. “It is such an honor, and I am humbled by it,” she said. “What I want, more than anything, is for every person to feel connected and valued and to have the tools to create the life they want. As a reading specialist, I use literacy to give students voice and agency. When they build a strong relationship with reading, they can access content, make informed decisions, and express themselves with confidence. I want every student to feel seen and heard, and to know that I care and our school community cares. Their voices matter. I also want fellow educators to feel valued and respected because what they bring to this work is important. We build support systems together that help everyone succeed.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DiEleuterio_Jenna_TOY2025_0080-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-27 10:57:43.451616

Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) rolled out a new website last week that seeks to document ICE activity across New Mexico. (Courtesy DHS)
A New Mexico lawmaker this week launched a new website her office created that aims to compile and verify reports of federal immigration arrests across the state.
Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) told Source New Mexico that a volunteer in her office spent the last several months creating AGUAS-NM.com in response to widespread—but hard-to-verify—reports of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting people across the state. 
“Our community is held to the rule of law, so why shouldn’t law enforcement…be documented in hopes that they will follow the law as well?” she told Source on Thursday in a phone interview. “It was born of frustration and hope that when we shine a little bit of light that hopefully transparency wins.”
The website greets visitors with a disclaimer about the potential inaccuracy of individual arrest reports, and it warns that the website should not be used to interfere with law enforcement operations, which Anaya also stressed in the interview. 
Resentment against Albuquerque ‘deliveristas’ may have sparked viral Walmart ICE arrest

Users can anonymously submit photos, videos or summaries of potential ICE arrests to the website, which will then appear on the map as “unverified” until representatives of community groups visit the site in person and talk to witnesses, Anaya said. 
Adding a layer of verification should help instill trust in the website while also aiming to stop the spread of misinformation, she said. 
“Often people will think that a private security guard is ICE when really they may not be,” she said. “And I think that’s why we’re focusing so heavily on making sure that we have validated and unvalidated check marks.”
Spokespersons for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and El Centro de Igualdad and Derechos, two immigrant advocacy organizations, declined to comment Friday on the new website.
Data about how many ICE arrests have occurred in New Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push is hard to come by, though national data suggests arrests are increasing. The number of people ICE has detained in the state’s three detention centers has steadily increased, as well.
Some statewide elected officials are trying to collect information about ICE arrests to distribute to the public, including in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. That’s another potential source of “verified” reports for the AGUAS-NM website, Anaya said. 
“When it comes to other areas of the state, clearly, that’ll work a little bit differently,” she said. “But for us, it’s more about transparency. I think the video and photo option also just really helps the community to be able to make up their own mind about whether or not it is a valid documentation or not.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ICE-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-27 10:17:13.847471

In Missouri — where the product faces attacks from law enforcement, state legislators and local governments who say it’s part of a public health crisis — that potential is $75.4 million annually.
“That’s the potential if you normalize this and provide consumers with access nationally,” said economic analyst Beau Whitney, whose study titled “The U.S. THC Beverage Report” was released last month.
Whitney is talking about products like the cans of low-dose THC seltzers that Missouri companies including Mighty Kind, Triple and URLit are producing. They’re currently found in bars, restaurants and stores like Randall’s and Total Wine. 
Whitney estimates that in 2024, actual sales nationwide were between $1 billion and $1.3 billion – with 76% of that being hemp-derived THC beverages and 24% being products sold in marijuana dispensaries.
For the marijuana industry, the estimated $270 million in THC beverage sales in dispensaries only represented about 1% of the industry’s total sales in 2024. 
Most brands average $2 million per year, the study found, while top brands can easily exceed $10 million or more in annual sales. 
Beau Whitney’s economic analysis forecasts overall growth of THC beverages in 2025 of 25% (Screenshot of Whitney’s report).
Joshua Grigaitis, owner of St. Louis-based Mighty Kind Co., which makes various kinds of hemp seltzers, says Whitney’s numbers are in line with what he’s seeing in the market.
Mighty Kind was among the first THC beverage products in Missouri, and Grigaitis has seen many brands pop up over the last year. Now, he said the competition to get products in bars and restaurants is “full on.” 
“It’s a great sign of growth for the whole space,” Grigaitis said. “It’s bringing awareness and credibility. Lots of brands are paying their lawyers to lobby for this. It’s not just us and a couple of the brands anymore.”
In Missouri, THC beverages are legal but completely unregulated by any government agency — which means there’s no age restriction on who can buy them. Distributors and retailers have self-imposed the same regulations they use on alcohol products, by requiring testing certification and that buyers have to show ID that they’re 21 or older. 
While the Missouri legislature attempted to pass regulations for THC beverages in the spring, the proposal drew heavy opposition – and ultimately failed – because it would have prohibited THC edibles, vapes and other products from being sold outside of dispensaries. 
Catherine Hanaway, who was sworn in as Missouri’s new attorney general this month, has vowed to make it a top priority to “utilize all vested authority in this office to attack the problem head on,” said James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff. 
“Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,” Lawson said. “This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it’s particularly detrimental.”
 Potential Missouri regulations

Whitney’s report forecasts overall growth of THC beverages in 2025 to be 25%. 
“This would be more aggressive given the trajectory of the market, however, there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty at both the federal and state levels that could inhibit the growth potential of the industry,” it states. 
Many are watching the debate in the U.S. Senate to potentially ban hemp THC products. By the end of this year, Whitney anticipates there will be “greater clarity” on a regulatory framework for hemp-derived THC, and in 2026, there will be an acceleration of the growth.
Currently, THC beverages are legal in 28 states and legal but restricted in another nine, according to the report. They can only be sold in marijuana stores in seven states, and they’re illegal in six states.
This spring, Steven Busch, owner of Krey Distributing in the St. Louis area, was a key player in trying to get Missouri regulations passed for not only beverages but also edibles and vapes. Nowadays THC liquor, a national brand, is a major item for his company, he said. 
Hemp THC beverages can be sold legally in 28 states outside of the marijuana dispensary system. Nine states restrict the sale of THC beverages by limiting the amount of THC in the beverages, and seven allow them only to be sold in dispensaries. They’re illegal in six states (Screenshot of The U.S. Beverage Report by Whitney Economics).
However, Busch ultimately opposed a bill he initially backed because the amended proposal would’ve allowed for the continued sales of THCA flower. 
THCA flower looks and delivers the same high as marijuana buds, but the main difference is that it’s harvested in a way that allows it to be classified as hemp. Since hemp is not a federally controlled substance, it’s being sold in some smoke shops and hemp stores in Missouri.
However in June, former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sent several cease-and-desist letters to companies selling THCA flower, threatening legal action if the companies continue to sell it. 
Busch said state lawmakers need to either pass legislation that regulates hemp-derived THC products this year or enact a total ban. 
“That would impact me in a negative way, but I think we have to think in terms of consumer safety and kids getting hold of these products,” Busch said. “So, yeah, if we can’t figure it out, then I think we need to ban it all. And I hope it doesn’t come to that.”
Brian Riegel, owner of URLit beverage company, has a hemp farm nearWashington, Mo., that will soon be able to produce enough harvest to sustain his two THC businesses, he said. He believes Whitney’s numbers are promising. 
For the past four years, Riegel has been involved in stopping legislation that would require his beverages and edibles to only be sold in marijuana dispensaries. That would ban his products because only items that come from licensed marijuana cultivators can be sold in dispensaries. 
This year, Riegel said he’s excited about initiative petitions that would ask voters next year to allow marijuana and intoxicating hemp products to be sold in the same stores as alcohol and tobacco.
He also hopes lawmakers at a minimum will pass requirements on age gating, childproof packaging and making sure every package identifies who is the manufacturer and distributor. 
“Those are three very minimalistic things that should be a no-brainer thing to get done,” said Riegel, who is also a leader with the Missouri Hemp Trade Association, “and will cost nobody anything, but could give law enforcement the proper channels to penalize somebody if they’re misbehaving.”
Grigaitis agrees with Riegel.
“If they were just to start labeling and regulating the packaging, you would start holding people accountable,” he said. “Right now, it’s the wild west. As soon as there’s even five rules on a piece of paper that everybody can see, everybody’s going to fall into place with those because you don’t want to be left out.” 
And he also agrees with Busch that THCA flower shouldn’t be included in the regulation conversation yet. The biggest reason, Grigaitis said, is that there’s no real consensus on the definition of THCA flower, and that needs to be agreed upon before it can be regulated.
“There needs to be a solution to that one before it’s allowed,” he said. “I’m not saying close the door, but that I could say that about a lot of things. If the drinks have something figured out, then let them through.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Karen--scaled-e1761337496824-1024x846.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 10:17:13.847471

On Oct. 3, Malone filed paperwork with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska asking for permission to take majority ownership of GCI Liberty Inc., the parent company of GCI Communications, Alaska’s largest internet company.
Malone already owns a majority of GCI Liberty’s voting shares, according to RCA filings, but until now has been limited by agreements that hold his voting power below 50%.
According to the filings, Malone is asking for authority to increase his voting power to “a level that would constitute control of GCI Liberty and its certificated subsidiary GCICC.”
The filings also state that both GCI Liberty and Malone have asked for a waiver that would allow them to keep their financial documents confidential.
Under state law and regulation, those documents would ordinarily be available for public inspection as part of regulators’ approval process.
Public comments on the request for secrecy are due to RCA by Tuesday, Oct. 28, and the state regulator is expected to review the takeover request after that date.
The takeover would also affect United Utilities, which provides telephone and internet service in rural Alaska, including much of the Yukon-Kuskokwim river delta region, filings show.

Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, speaking to Rep. Charles Owen in the House Chamber. (Allison Allsop/ Louisiana Illuminator)State Rep. Julie Emerson of Carencro announced Monday she will challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, adding an interesting element to the state’s first Republican party primary in 50 years.
“I’m running for the United States Senate because Louisiana deserves a senator who can lead, deliver, and help rebuild America’s confidence,” Emerson said in a statement from her campaign. “For the first time in years, the future feels brighter than the past.” 
In a polished 4-minute online video, Emerson, 37, declared her intention to join a crowded GOP field, touting her 10 years experience in the legislature. As chairman to the House Ways and Means Committee, she authored the extensive state tax overhaul lawmakers approved last year. It included the adoption of a flat individual and corporate income tax, and the state sales tax was increased to 5% and expanded to cover more items.
Emerson also championed Gov. Jeff Landry’s effort to expand the use of public dollars for private school vouchers, though the LA GATOR program has not been funded to the extent the governor wishes.  
She also led the move to end the open “jungle” primaries that Louisiana has used since 1975,  putting her in the party primary field with announced candidates state Treasurer John Flemming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of New Iberia, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta and St. Tammany Parish Council member Kathy Seiden. 
Each one hopes to capture the conservative Louisiana electorate that propelled Landry to an outright primary win in the 2023 governor’s race, and all are attacking Cassidy’s vulnerability for voting to impeach President Donald Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun on Monday called a special session to take up congressional redistricting, a politically charged move that follows months of mounting pressure from national Republicans to redraw Indiana’s map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Braun’s order says the session will begin Monday, Nov. 3 and will focus primarily on revising the state’s congressional boundaries — lines that were last redrawn in 2021 following the U.S. Census.
Braun’s office said lawmakers will use the special session to “consider altering the boundaries of Indiana’s congressional districts,” but also to “consider resolving an important issue regarding federal and state tax compliance that must be addressed.”
“I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” the governor said in a Monday morning statement. “I am also asking the legislature to conform Indiana’s tax code with new federal tax provisions to ensure stability and certainty for taxpayers and tax preparers for 2026 filings.”

The news release from the governor’s office noted that Indiana uses federal tax law as the starting point for the Indiana tax return, and the recent changes to federal tax law in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act include provisions “that impact Indiana state tax filings.”
Addressing that “discrepancy” through a special session “will provide taxpayers, accountants and businesses the confidence and clarity ahead of filing season, avoid amended returns and filing delays, and continue the Indiana Department of Revenue’s strong record of fiscal management,” according to Braun’s office.
The state’s most recent special session in 2022 — which lasted two weeks and centered on abortion-related legislations — cost taxpayers about $240,000 in per-diem and travel expenses.
Legislative leaders don’t have to convene the exact day that Braun suggested. By law, the only rule is it can’t last for more than 30 session days or 40 calendar days. That clock will begin Nov 3.
In 2022, then-Gov. Eric Holcomb’s order began the session on July 6 but lawmakers didn’t convene until July 25, and it ended Aug. 5.
The announcement comes after weeks of speculation in the Statehouse, fueled by a series of meetings between Hoosier GOP leaders and top figures in President Donald Trump’s orbit, including Vice President JD Vance. Trump spoke with Indiana Senate Republicans by phone on Oct. 17.











I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


Discussions have centered on ways to strengthen the party’s position in the U.S. House — where Republicans hold a narrow majority — by encouraging  states with GOP-strongholds to redraw districts before 2026.
During the leadup, House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray have refuse to publicly say where they stand.
It’s unclear how long the special session will last. Lawmakers could suspend rules to pass a map in just a day or two, but it’s unlikely there are enough votes to do that. A bill must be heard three times in each chamber, meaning a likely minimum of six days.
Legislative leaders are expected to outline their next steps in the coming days.
The last time Indiana redrew its congressional lines, the process stretched over several months and included statewide public hearings. This time, lawmakers will be under greater pressure to move quickly.
Candidate filing for the 2026 primary opens Jan. 7, leaving a narrow window for debate, map approval and potential legal challenges.
The next regularly scheduled legislative session will kick off in January.
 Special session just weeks away
Braun has maintained that his goal is to “let the Legislature lead,” emphasizing that he wants the process to unfold through normal legislative channels rather than by executive dictate.
The Republican governor had previously said he would wait to call lawmakers back until they signaled readiness, telling reporters in August, “You’re going to hear individual representatives and senators speak up … that process will take a while to play out.”
But Braun also warned that “if we try to drag our feet as a state on it, probably, we’ll have consequences of not working with the Trump administration as tightly as we should.”
Indiana’s GOP legislative leaders have met at least three times with Vance in recent weeks. Bray described the latest conversation as “productive,” though he stopped short of confirming whether Senate Republicans were fully united behind an early redraw.
Before Braun’s decision, opposition had been building among both Democrats and some Republicans.
Indiana Senate GOP says redistricting votes ‘aren’t there,’ stalling mid-decade push

Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, said in August that there is “no justification” for revisiting maps drawn less than four years ago, arguing that redistricting should occur only after the decennial census. And Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, separately told the Indiana Capital Chronicle earlier this month that most lawmakers she’s spoken with aren’t eager to reopen the maps.
Democrats have likewise accused the governor and GOP leaders of orchestrating a “partisan power grab” meant to benefit Trump-aligned candidates. Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder of Bloomington said following Vance’s October visit to Indiana that Republicans “don’t have the votes, currently” to pass new maps without dissent within their own ranks.
That skepticism appears to mirror public sentiment.
Multiple polls — including one released in August and one earlier this month — have found that the majority of Hoosiers oppose early redistricting.
One statewide survey found that a majority of Hoosiers — about 53% — oppose early redistricting, compared to just 34% who support it. Another survey showed waning trust in both parties, with growing numbers of voters saying they feel disconnected from state political leadership.
But in recent days, a flurry of Senate Republicans have announced their support.
The Capital Chronicle has been tracking public statements on the proposal. As of Monday, 11 Senate Republicans have come out in support while five are against. The rest of the 40-member caucus is undecided or haven’t commented publicly.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)When Donald Trump returned to the presidency, he restarted the trade war he had initiated during his first term. The major buyer for U.S. soybeans has been China, but the country has bought none this year. Prices for the commodity are so low that some farmers told PBS News they’re storing their product in hopes of an economic recovery — repeating what happened during Trump’s first foray into tariffs.
With farmers strapped, Trump is reportedly considering another bailout, this time for $10 billion.
During his last trade war, the Trump administration paid farmers through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, often referred to as a “credit card” that helps address farmers’ shortfalls. It has typically been used for relatively small amounts of assistance, but the first Trump administration used it to provide more than $20 billion in subsidies, the largest chunk of change in the corporation’s history.

Congress has the power of the purse, but the move bypassed congressional approval, and the administration appears to be attempting the same maneuver this time. The corporation’s fund only has $4 billion left, so officials could tap money from tariffs — which American consumers pay — to make up the difference, according to Politico.
Beyond that, it’s unclear how the payments will be made or who will benefit.
It’s also become unclear in recent days if the bailout is coming. Politico reported this month that the government shutdown could mean no money is available.
The first bailout, known as the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), was criticized for not evenly distributing its assistance, as InvestigateTV and Investigate Midwest found in 2022. For instance, farmers producing the same crop received different payments.
Also, beginning farmers and historically underserved farmers received paltry sums. High-income farms, on the other hand, received massive assistance.
An analysis by U.S. Senate Democrats found MFP payments were concentrated in Southern states, despite soybeans — which are primarily grown in the Midwest — being the original commodity in dispute. “The Administration’s trade assistance continues to pick winners and losers,” Democrats charged.
A legal architect of the first bailout was Stephen Vaden, who served as the USDA’s general counsel in Trump’s first term. He’s currently serving as the USDA’s deputy secretary, the No. 2 to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
In 2019, the Senate asked Vaden about the discrepancies: “Since MFP was established to address the China trade dispute, how do you explain to soybean growers why cotton growers should receive more financial help than them?”
Vaden defended the MFP by saying it was intended to include “commodities both directly and indirectly affected by the trade dispute, in order to minimize potential distortions. … Soybean farmers are receiving assistance according to the trade damage they have faced.”
Farm groups have repeatedly said they want free trade with the rest of the world, but after the MFP, experts predicted the massive infusion of subsidies would train farmers to expect assistance during rough financial times.
“I think, without a doubt, this has set an expectation that whenever there are bumps — or perceived bumps — in the road, that the USDA will automatically trigger out payments in one form or another,” Johnathan Coppess, an agricultural policy expert at the University of Illinois, told InvestigateTV and Investigate Midwest in 2022.

At a planned rally today at UCLA, the faculty associations of UCLA and the wider University of California are taking a victory lap and urging Gov. Gavin Newsom to join their fight against President Donald Trump’s demands for a $1.2-billion settlement with the renowned public university.
The federal administration’s 27-page settlement proposal was made public Friday after the UCLA Faculty Association and the Council of University of California Faculty Associations sued the public university to disclose the information under the California Public Records Act. The proposal outlines the administration’s vision for higher education that is free from efforts to promote diversity and transgender inclusion.
The university system argued that making the proposal public would cause it “irreparable harm” during ongoing negotiations with the administration, but released the information after a California superior court judge ordered it to do so, and the state Supreme Court rejected its appeal.
UCLA is currently grappling with the administration’s bid to force it to pay $1.2 billion after the U.S. Department of Justice in July accused the university of not doing enough to combat antisemitism during last year’s pro-Palestine protests, and for allegedly violating federal civil rights law. Newsom has characterized the fine as “extortion,” and UC President James Milliken said that paying the settlement would “completely devastate” the university system.
In issuing the demands, the Trump administration initially withheld more than $500 million in research grants to UCLA. But its leverage remains unclear now after a federal judge ordered the administration to restore nearly all those grants in August and September.
Some of the administration’s demands requires UCLA to:

Hire a senior administrator to review UCLA’s policies related to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and eliminate “identity-based preferences” in faculty hiring and scholarship programs.
Prohibit the use of “personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discrimination” in its admissions process. (A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling already prohibits race-based admissions, though students are free to submit essays that detail how race affected their lives.)
Prohibit the UCLA School of Medicine and its affiliated hospitals from performing gender affirming surgeries or hormone therapy for patients under 18.
Issue a public statement saying that it will comply with Trump’s executive order that recognizes male and female as the only two sexes. 
Ban female transgender student athletes from participating in women’s sports.
Establish a process so that “foreign students likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American, or antisemitic disruptions or harassment” are not admitted to UCLA. (That seems to be at odds with the letter’s goal of protecting UCLA “faculty and students from retaliation for expressing minority opinions or engaging in free expression.”)
Develop training materials to “socialize international students to the norms of a campus dedicated to free inquiry and open debate.”

Some of the administration’s demands are already UC policy, including the elimination of diversity statements in faculty hiring, which the UC banned earlier this year, and banning overnight demonstrations at university locations.

Anna Markowitz, president of the UCLA Faculty Association: If UCLA goes through with the demands, “It is not just today’s students and workers who will be harmed by this gross federal overreach — but generations of Californians.” 

More than 600 UC Jewish students, faculty and alumni also publicly opposed the settlement in an open letter posted in August.

Proposing a wealth tax on CA billionaires

As California faces a potentially tough budget year, labor and health care groups are pushing for a 2026 ballot measure that would levy a one-time tax on California billionaires, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
The Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West and St. John’s Community Health in Los Angeles are proposing a 5% wealth tax on the roughly 200 billionaires who live in the state. Unlike an income tax on someone’s earnings, a wealth tax — which Newsom has historically opposed — levies a tax on a person’s net worth, including assets such property value, pensions and owned artwork. Proponents say the tax would generate about $100 billion in revenue, which would go into a special fund for health care and K-12 education spending.
But Susan Shelley, the vice president of communications for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association — a nonprofit that lobbies for lower taxes — said the proposal could set a troubling precedent if passed. Over time, the tax “could come all the way down to the middle class” by going after home equity wealth, said Shelley.

With early in-person voting already underway in some counties, let’s dive into some election news:

ICE at the polls?: The possibility that immigration enforcement agents would show up at polling places during California’s Nov. 4 special election is a growing concern among some state officials and voters. Without providing evidence, Newsom earlier this month said he expected ICE and Border Patrol agents at voting places as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress Democratic voters. In a September survey of registered Latino voters by the Latino Community Foundation, 53% said they planned to vote in person, and two-thirds said they were at least somewhat worried that ICE or Border Patrol agents could show up at polling places. Read more from CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.


Trump sends election monitors to CA: Prompted by a request from the California Republican Party, the U.S. Department of Justice said it will deploy election monitors to five California counties on Election Day to “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.” Both parties regularly deploy poll watchers, and Bryan Watkins, a former senior adviser to the state GOP party argues the request is “entirely normal.” But some California Democrats criticized the request as a weaponization of the Justice Department.

Newsom had the chance to pass landmark legislation to protect Californians from transnational repression — a type of violence in which countries reach into the U.S. to intimidate or harm members of their diaspora — but his veto sends a troubling message about the state’s commitment to safety, writes Mohammed Jawad, national president of the Indian American Muslim Council.

(File photo by Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)$10,474 — that stunning sum represents the average cost of child care for a single infant at a licensed center in South Carolina, according to Child Care Aware of America.
For many families, especially families with multiple children, child care is not just expensive, it is unaffordable.
This growing burden is pushing parents out of the workforce and discouraging family growth. Yet, while policymakers express alarm over declining birth rates and looming labor shortages, they aren’t investing in the very child care resources that make raising children feasible.
This contradiction has real consequences.
A 2023 report by ReadyNation estimates that the infant-toddler child care crisis costs the U.S. economy a staggering $122 billion annually in lost earnings, productivity, and tax revenue. It’s based on a December 2022 national survey commissioned by ReadyNation. Nearly one in four parents of children under 3 reported being fired for work interruptions due to child care struggles. Slightly more parents reported quitting a job due to child care problems.
The child care system’s collapse is much bigger than a burden on individual families. It is an economic and social failure that threatens long-term growth.
Yet, instead of addressing this crisis, federal leaders proposed a federal budget for the 2026 fiscal year which did not prioritize Head Start funding and did not increase it to meet inflationary demands.
Head Start is a long-standing federal program that serves over 750,000 low-income children up to 5 years old with early education, nutrition, and health services.
Funding freezes and layoffs at Head Start and similar programs don’t just affect low-income families; they significantly increase the strain on the broader child care network by increasing demand in a system already bordering on collapse. Reductions to early intervention services for babies with disabilities, services proven to improve educational outcomes, would compound the damage.
Meanwhile, amid Congress’ inability to agree on any funding, the federal government shutdown threatens Head Start programs nationwide.
It is tempting to frame this as a low-income issue, but middle-class and upper-middle-class families are feeling the pinch as well. Long waitlists, staffing shortages, and high turnover — in addition to affordability — make access to high quality child care difficult.
The consequences are more than financial.
When families cannot afford care, children miss out on critical early learning that sets the foundation for future academic success.
Research done over a decade ago shows that children who attend high-quality early childhood programs are more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and stay out of the criminal justice system. Investing in early childhood programs is not charity; it is smart public policy with long-term returns.
We are also seeing the cracks in safety and oversight. In June 2024, two toddlers were found wandering a busy road in Greer, South Carolina, after leaving a daycare facility unsupervised.
While this may seem like an isolated incident, underfunded, understaffed programs cause alarming incidents like this to occur throughout the country. When facilities are forced to operate on thin margins with underpaid staff, the quality and safety of children suffer.
Acknowledging the problem is not enough. We must take meaningful action to support children and the caregivers who nurture them.
Fundamentally, child care must be recognized as economic infrastructure. Policymakers cannot claim to promote “self-reliance” while dismantling the systems that allow parents to work and families to thrive.
Affordable child care is not a handout. It is an important investment in our workforce, our economy, and our children’s futures.
We cannot ask families to have more children while making it harder and more expensive to care for them.
The child care crisis affects everyone: parents, children, employers, and taxpayers.
Until we treat it like the national emergency it is, no amount of concern about birth rates or labor shortages will change our course. If we want a better future, we must build it, starting with the youngest among us.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/preschool-shapes.jpg,,,2025-10-27 08:57:24.271489

CART High offers work experience, academics tailored to students’ interests, stronger personal connections with staff and multidisciplinary courses that link directly to careers and community needs


At CART High near Fresno, there is no gum stuck to the floor. The saffron-yellow walls are unmarred by graffiti. Toting laptops, students file calmly down spacious, light-filled hallways to classes like biotechnology and digital marketing. There’s no fighting, no shouting, no bells. No one even cuts class.
It’s hard to believe CART High is a public high school. But in the future, this may be a model for every high school in California.
“We can see from the data that the big, old-fashioned factory model of high school – where students run from class to class with a locker as their only stable point of contact – is not succeeding,” said Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the State Board of Education. “We need to overhaul the whole idea of what high school can be, and right now we have an opportunity to do so.”
The California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, a state agency, is launching a pilot program to redesign high school and middle school. Groups of districts already working on escaping the factory model applied for grant money, and winners will meet, brainstorm, work through challenges and share their experiences statewide, in hopes of inspiring other districts to create innovative high school options. The money will come from $10 million recently allotted in the state budget, as well as state programs promoting career pathways and dual enrollment in high school. 
The idea is to move beyond the traditional high school — with its rigid 50-minute periods and stand-alone classes — and replace it with a new type of school that offers work experience, academics tailored to students’ interests, stronger personal connections with staff and multidisciplinary courses that link directly to careers and community needs.

“It should be a joy to go to school every day,” Darling-Hammond said. “That’s what we’re looking for.”
Countless schools in California use elements of this idea, with schools-within-schools that offer career academies or other specialized programs. But very few high schools are devoted completely to it.
How high school came to be
Public high schools have only existed for about a century in the U.S. Education for younger children has existed for hundreds of years, but the idea of school for teenagers only came about in the early 20th century. The original high schools were based loosely on a factory model of efficiency, with learning measured in Carnegie units — 120 hours spent over a year studying a particular topic. Promulgated by the Carnegie Foundation at the time in an effort to standardize education, the measure is still used at nearly all high schools and colleges.
But advances in adolescent neuroscience have shown that teenagers learn more in a flexible environment with plenty of hand-on projects and teamwork. Instead of sitting quietly at desks and listening to a teacher, students are more likely to be engaged if they’re allowed some autonomy to pursue topics they’re interested in, with their peers.
Alternative schools — typically, schools for students who aren’t succeeding in traditional school — have been experimenting with this approach for decades. The state’s top alternative schools aim to not only help students graduate, but also pair them with internships, teach them practical life skills and address their emotional well-being. They often have flexible schedules and small classes, with teachers getting to know students and their families personally.
There’s plenty of evidence that traditional high schools may be outdated. In the most recent state student survey, nearly half of 11th graders said school “is really boring.” Almost 25% of 11th graders were chronically absent last year.
Academically, the numbers were equally dismal. Just 30% of California 11th graders performed at or above grade level in math last year, with some student groups faring much worse. Although the graduation rate was 87%, fewer than half of those students had finished a college or career preparation track.

“The data speaks for itself,” said Russlynn Ali, head of XQ Institute, which advocates for high school reform, and a former head of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights under President Barack Obama. “There are young people today who’ve graduated from high school but can’t calculate the tip on a split bill, grasp the main idea in an op-ed piece. The case for change is unmistakeable.”
Transcripts and units
There are a few obstacles to transforming high schools statewide to look like CART. One is higher education. The University of California and California State University require high school students to pass a series of classes, known as A-G, to qualify for admission. Advocates for high school redesign say those requirements are too rigid, and high schools need some flexibility in creating new classes that are more interesting to students and more connected to life outside the classroom. They also say that traditional letter grades, which colleges rely on to admit students, are too limiting and that colleges need to consider a new kind of transcript that more accurately reflects students’ abilities.
Another obstacle is the Carnegie unit, which is an integral part of the way high schools and colleges are structured. Even the Carnegie Foundation has been lobbying for changes, arguing that schools should measure students’ progress based on what they know, rather than how much time they’ve spent in a classroom. But so far, colleges have shown little interest in dropping the Carnegie unit.
A school for ‘the C kid’
CART High, which stands for Center for Advanced Research and Technology, opened about 25 years ago in a renovated water pump facility in Clovis. A joint initiative between Clovis Unified and Fresno Unified, the idea was to reach students who were floundering in school and give them some career experience that could also boost the local economy. It wasn’t quite an alternative school, but it wasn’t an honors program, either.
“We weren’t looking for the top students. We were looking for the disengaged kids,” said Staci Bynum, CART’s dean of curriculum and instruction who’s been at the school since its inception. “The C kid is going to excel here.”
CART is open to 11th and 12th graders from both districts, with students selected through a lottery. Last year, more than 2,200 students applied and 1,000 were accepted. Nearly 80% of CART’s enrollment is low-income.

Students spend half their day at their regular high school taking math, foreign language, art and other classes, and half their day at CART, where they choose an area of focus. Options include law and policy, business, forensics and psychology, among other topics. 
Classes, which the school calls labs, are three hours long, and are taught by a trio of teachers who weave in literature and other academic subjects that are relevant to the subject. In biotechnology, for example, students read “The Andromeda Strain” and “The Martian,” and write their own science fiction stories based on concepts they’re learning in class. In the law class, students read Othello or Hamlet then subject characters to a mock trial.
“We work really hard to get kids to see the bigger picture of why they’re learning what they’re learning,” said English teacher Emily Saeteurn. “We want them to have that ‘aha!’ moment.”

Attendance is nearly 100% and discipline problems are almost unheard of, said principal Rick Watson. More than 90% of students scored at least “proficient” on the English portion of the Smarter Balanced test. Students take the math portion at their other high school.
When he’s not running the school, Watson is giving tours. Education officials from around the world often visit, in hopes of replicating the CART model. Numerous CART-inspired schools have opened around California.
“You have kids in comprehensive high schools everywhere who are falling through the cracks,” Watson said. “Comprehensive high schools don’t work for some B, C, D students. The students  have potential but they’re disconnected.They’re desperate for a different model of education.”
Senior Madelyn Quiroga, who’s in the biotechnology class, said she has mediocre grades at her regular high school, but all A’s at CART.

“At my other school, they just throw stuff at you and never really explain it. Here, they actually teach us,” she said. “And it’s all stuff we actually want to know, so it sticks in your brain. Like when I hear someone talk about CRISPR (gene editing technology), it’s like, ‘Oh, I know something about that.’”
Audrey Riede, an 11th grader in the law class, said she’s so inspired she wants to be a defense attorney.
“CART is way better than normal school,” she said. “The teachers aren’t just trying to get you to pass, they really want to make you think. It’s just a totally different environment.”

Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would've trained police to respond to transnational oppression, such as when foreign governments like India oppress expats living in California.","Guest Commentary written by

Mohammed Jawad is national president of the Indian American Muslim Council


Gov. Gavin Newsom recently vetoed what would have been landmark legislation aimed at protecting Californians from transnational repression, when foreign governments target diaspora communities and expatriates living in other countries. 
Newsom’s decision is a missed opportunity to help Californians feel safer, especially the state’s sizable South Asian community, which for years has faced intimidation and violence orchestrated by India’s Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The FBI defines transnational repression as when foreign governments “reach beyond their borders to … harm members of their diaspora and exile communities in the United States.” It can include stalking, harassment, abusive legal practices, online disinformation campaigns, assault and even assassinations. 
A quarter of the world’s governments use repressive tactics to silence critics living outside their borders, according to the human rights group Freedom House. While countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and China are notable culprits, India is becoming notorious as one of the only democracies engaging in acts of aggression against Indian expats. 
Last year a bipartisan group of U.S. Congress members co-sponsored a resolution that listed India among the major perpetrators of foreign maltreatment. 
India’s Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party, which seeks to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu majoritarian state, has long relied on intimidation and violence to silence dissent within its borders. In recent years, assassination attempts have been attributed to it and have extended beyond India’s borders. The most striking examples occurred in 2023 with the fatal shooting in Canada of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, founder of Sikhs for Justice, and the attempted assassination of Sikh American activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York.
Members of the Indian diaspora in the U.S. — particularly Sikhs, Muslims and Dalits — have faced international restrictions for years. Many have been denied visas or had their Overseas Citizen of India cards revoked as political retaliation. (The card allows foreign nationals of Indian origin to visit India without a visa.)
Others who have criticized India’s government have endured coordinated disinformation and hate campaigns driven by Indian intelligence-linked networks, as well as the targeting of family members back home, threats of violence and the suspension of their social media accounts and websites in India. 
Even U.S. Rep Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat representing Seattle and a vocal critic of the Modi regime, has publicly worried she could be barred from visiting her parents in India due to her outspoken positions.
All of this affects California, because it is home to the nation’s largest Indian population. Last year, for instance, several Sikh Americans in Fremont reported an assassination attempt when someone shot at them from unmarked vehicles on a highway. 
The Indian government also has produced disinformation to target and smear civil rights groups fighting to protect Californians from caste discrimination. Indian consulates, including one in San Francisco, reportedly sought to restrict travel rights of critics of the Modi government, at times ordering the deportation of American citizens from India and sharing intelligence gathered on U.S.-based individuals with Indian authorities.
These are precisely the safety risks that Senate Bill 509 was designed to address. But Newsom’s veto will deny prosecutors tools they need to hold perpetrators of these global attacks on Californians accountable. By rejecting the bill’s mandate for training, Newsom has left law enforcement ill-equipped to identify and respond to such attacks, especially when they are abetted by U.S.-based groups. 
California had the chance to take an historic stand against foreign repression. Instead, Newsom’s decision sends a troubling message about the state’s commitment to safety and accountability. The fight against transnational repression is only beginning, but his veto will be remembered as a setback, a missed moment for Californians affected by this rising danger.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070523_SB-403-Caste_SN_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 08:57:24.271489

Gavin Newsom has repeatedly asserted that the Trump administration could send immigration agents to polling places in an attempt to intimidate voters and depress turnout. 
The governor’s warnings, while unspecific, speak to what community leaders call real, palpable fears within some Latino communities that immigration agents could show up on Election Day. And ever since the Supreme Court greenlit using racial profiling in immigration stops, even U.S. citizens are scared they could be detained simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
“You’re going to likely see members of our military in and around polling booths and voting places all across this country,” Newsom warned last week during a virtual event with former President Barack Obama in support of Proposition 50. “I would say the same about ICE and Border Patrol, and I say that soberly.”
Newsom has not provided any evidence to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will deploy immigration agents to polling sites. But he pointed to the Los Angeles campaign launch event for Prop. 50, his plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats, where federal immigration agents blocked supporters from entering the area and detained a nearby strawberry vendor. 
A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrote in a statement that the agency “is not planning operations targeting polling locations,” but that if agents are tracking “a dangerous criminal alien” who goes near a voting site they could be arrested there. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol did not respond to emailed questions.
The governor argues that the Trump administration’s indiscriminate immigration raids, military and National Guard deployments are intended to suppress Democratic voters and keep Republicans in control of Congress for the duration of Trump’s presidency. 
“We know the intention of this administration — to rig next year’s midterms,” Newsom told reporters recently. “It’s absolutely predictable. It’s a script that’s been written for centuries. It’s the authoritarian playbook.”

The Trump administration’s Justice Department announced on Friday that it will deploy personnel to monitor polling sites in five counties: Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside on Election Day. Fresno, Kern and Riverside counties are majority Latino. 
The poll monitors will “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law,” according to the department. The administration has not said whether the agents will be stationed at polling sites in addition to county election offices where ballots are counted.
Democrats denounced the plan.
“Deploying federal forces to ‘monitor’ elections is nothing more than an intimidation tactic meant to suppress the vote,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party. “What Republicans are really afraid of is record voter participation and a clear verdict from the people of California in support of Prop 50.”
‘Alarming’ number of Latinos fear ICE at polls
The vast majority of Californians vote by mail, especially since the state adopted universal mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just over 80% of votes cast in the 2024 presidential election were mail-in ballots. 
But casting a ballot in-person on Election Day is a point of pride for many American immigrants, especially Latinos, said Yvette Martinez, executive director of the California Democratic Party. 
“It’s a cultural thing,” said Martinez. “People want to show up and say, ‘I’m patriotic, here’s my civic duty. I’m here to vote, I’m here to make my voice heard. And when you quell that, it’s dangerous. And it’s actually sad.”
In a September survey of 1,200 registered Latino voters conducted by the Latino Community Foundation, a nonprofit that funds Latino advocacy, 53% said they planned to vote in person. Of those, more than half said they would vote on Election Day. 
The same survey also found that two-thirds of the Latino voters surveyed said they were at least somewhat worried that ICE or Border Patrol agents could show up at polling places. The poll had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. 
“These are citizens of this country. And if they are concerned about immigration or any type of federal presence at in-person voting sites, that is alarming,” said Christian Arana, who leads policy strategy for the foundation.
“If people want to vote in person, it is their fundamental right,” Arana said. “I never want us to buy into the fear that you can’t participate in democracy because immigration enforcement may show up.”

So far in the race for Prop. 50, only 9% of registered Latino voters have returned their ballots, according to the most recent data available from Political Data Inc., compared to 19% of white voters and 13% of Black voters. California pollster Ben Tulchin, who recently surveyed Latino voters about Prop. 50, said those numbers “are not unusual” since Latino voters tend to lag other ethnic and racial groups in casting ballots. 
Sen. Anna Caballero, Democrat of Merced, said U.S. citizens told her they’re afraid to go outside, especially when there have been reports of ICE sightings in the region. Many of her constituents come from mixed-status families in which some family members are citizens and others aren’t. She blames the Trump administration for terrifying those families so much that they don’t want to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. 
“This idea that all you have to do is pull out your driver’s license, or pull out some kind of documentation, that’s a fantasy,” said Caballero. “U.S. citizens have been detained and taken into custody.”
A recent investigation by ProPublica found that at least 170 U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by ICE since the second Trump administration took office, prompting intense criticism from opponents. Top Democrats on the House and Senate government oversight committees, Rep. Robert Garcia of California and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, have opened an investigation.
Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria, another Merced Democrat and the daughter of Mexican immigrants, said ever since the Supreme Court issued its racial profiling ruling earlier this summer, she keeps her passport in her bag at all times.
“Just because you may look like an immigrant — which I don’t even know what that really means — you know, I could also be targeted,” Soria said. 
‘My voice will be heard’
Opponents of Newsom’s redistricting plan say the governor’s warnings about Election Day intimidation and interference from federal agents are exaggerated. 
“People see it for what it is. It’s politics, it’s headline-grabbing,” said Hector Barajas, a spokesperson for the No on 50 campaign. 
Barajas denounced Democrats for what he said was intentional disenfranchisement of nonwhite voters, since white college-educated voters are historically far more likely to turn out during off-year elections.
“This is what happens with special elections, is people don’t turn out to vote, especially Hispanics, which is a sad tragedy in itself,” Barajas said.
Martinez said Democratic Party volunteers are for the first time urging voters to return their ballots early via mail or drop-off when they go door to door and handing out pamphlets with instructions for how to report any suspicious activity near polling sites. 
The party has also trained hundreds of volunteers as poll watchers who will monitor polling sites for signs of intimidation or federal interference starting the weekend before Election Day. 
Arana, with the Latino Community Foundation, said he’s choosing to vote in person as an act of defiance. 
“I’m seeing this as a form of a declaration that I am a Latino man in the state,” he said. “My voice will be heard on this issue, and no one is ever gonna take that right away from me.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/060722-Sac-County-Voter-Registrar-MG-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 08:57:24.271489

Thanks to an amendment adopted at the Democrats’ state convention, the official party platform explicitly supports providing legislative aides with “the compensation, support, and collective bargaining rights they deserve.” It marked the latest sign of unionization backing from a party that regularly pitches itself as pro-labor, following endorsements from most of the state’s all Democratic congressional delegation and then-gubernatorial candidate Maura Healey. 
There’s just one hitch: the seemingly widespread support for legislative staff unionization makes little difference if, as continues to be the case, the two Democrats who control the Legislature aren’t on board.  
Years after staff went public with their demands, the two people who call the shots in the Legislature show no interest in allowing them to organize. Meanwhile, supporters who have sway on Beacon Hill are not expending much political capital — if any — on the effort. 
That leaves State House aides in a mostly powerless position, with the most obvious routes forward both blocked by legislative leaders.  
Senate President Karen Spilka has declined to recognize the staff union, saying the chamber’s attorney concluded that legislative staff under statute do not receive the same collective bargaining rights afforded to most other public employees. In the House, where organizing aides have not yet achieved a majority of staff with signed union cards, Speaker Ron Mariano has not weighed in. 
Some lawmakers proposed legislation that would clear up the legal concern raised by the Senate president’s team and award those rights, but House and Senate bosses who decide which bills get votes have so far kept the measures on ice. 
To frustrated legislative staff members leading the union drive, the commitment of Democratic leaders to organized labor should begin at home.   
“This is a test of the Legislature’s commitment to collective bargaining rights and our pro-union rhetoric,” said Ravi Simon, a House employee and one of the organizers of the unionization effort. “I would hope that legislators that consider themselves pro-union would approach this issue with real thoughtfulness and from a perspective of trying to figure out how to make collective bargaining and unionization work in the State House.”
‘Intense burnout’ common in legislative offices, staffers say
Staffers play an integral role in the function of the Legislature. Their jobs cover a wide range of titles and responsibilities, from connecting constituents with services to researching legal frameworks in other states and drafting legislation.  
“We rely on them day in and day out to ensure that are we prepared, we are informed, we are on time, and to meet our obligations as elected officials,” said Rep. Rodney Elliott, a Lowell Democrat who supports staff unionization efforts. “They’re in the district, they’re in the State House. Sometimes they have to work nights. More often than not, they certainly work more than 40 hours [a week].” 
Union organizers argue that jobs in the House and Senate are “not financially, emotionally, or professionally sustainable,” pointing to modest pay, uneven schedules for raises, and a lackluster career ladder. 
Typical pay for legislative staff is not quite paltry, but neither is it particularly generous, especially in a state with such a notoriously high cost of living. 
This year, the median annual salary rate is $65,550 for full-time House staff and $84,299 for full-time Senate staff, according to a CommonWealth Beacon analysis of state payroll data. That analysis included legislative employees who do not work for an individual lawmaker, such as House and Senate counsel and clerks. 
MIT’s Living Wage calculator estimates a single adult with no children would need to earn an hourly wage of $28.88, or about $60,070 per year, to “cover the costs of their family’s basic needs” in Massachusetts. About 31 percent of full-time House staff and 6 percent of full-time Senate staff earn an annual rate less than that, payroll data show. 
The “living wage” threshold increases significantly once dependents are in the mix. If two adults with two children are both working, they would each need to make at least $78,436 to cover the cost of living in Massachusetts, according to the Living Wage calculator.  One adult with no children who must care for another adult would need to earn $80,600. A single parent of one child would need to earn $114,712. 
Those projections cover the state as a whole, including lower-cost areas hours away from Boston. Residents who live closer to the State House need to make even more to achieve a comfortable quality of life. 
Organizers say pay is one of the top issues weighing on staff. 
The unionization campaign surveyed more than 200 aides in late 2023 and early 2024, and found that 87 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with their salary and compensation — by far the most common pain point. 
Nearly seven in 10 staff said they are worried about their current financial situation, and nearly eight in 10 said they would not be able to support dependents on their State House salary alone, according to the survey. 
More than half of the aides surveyed planned to leave the Legislature within two years, a high rate of churn that organizers say deprives the House and Senate of institutional knowledge.  Many aides like their jobs and enjoy working in the public sector, according to Simon, who said his colleagues want more training to hone their skills and sufficient pay to live in the area. 
“When they don’t have that, I think there’s intense burnout,” he said. “People come in really excited and eager, and after a year, they’re thinking about what they need to do in order to pay rent or have reasonable work-life balance. So people start to job hunt, and I think it’s a real shame.” 
“For the most part, people really enjoy their jobs and they like the work that they’re doing,” added Will Woodring, another House staffer and union organizer. “But they’re frustrated with working conditions. They’re frustrated that there’s no schedule for raises.” 
The campaign conducted another survey in recent months and plans to publish updated results soon. 
Senate president still ‘does not see a path forward’ 
A majority of Senate employees have signed union cards signaling an interest in collective bargaining. Organizers have not yet won support from a majority of House aides, though they say the number on board is growing. 
They are working with IBEW Local 2222, a union that represents thousands of workers in other industries across the region. 
Legislative leaders have awarded several sizable pay raises since the unionization effort broke into public view, most recently in 2024 for the House and in August of this year for the Senate. With an eye on the complaints organizing staff made, the Senate updated its compensation structure, and the House launched new harassment prevention trainings. 
As for collective bargaining, however, legislative leaders today hold exactly the same position they did when the issue first erupted more than three years ago. 
Spilka in 2022 told senators and staff that “the Senate does not at this time see a path forward for a traditional employer-union relationship in the Senate as we are currently structured.” Union organizers say Senate counsel determined the state law governing public worker collective bargaining does not extend to legislative staff. 
“I remain committed to making the Senate a great place to serve the people of the Commonwealth while building a career,” Spilka wrote in a memo at the time. “We will continue our efforts to improve working conditions, benefits, and salaries, and we will incorporate staff input as we have done throughout my tenure.” 
A Spilka spokesperson told CommonWealth Beacon that her position today “remains consistent with the stance she took following Senate counsel’s review in 2022.”  
Mariano declined to comment.

The history of public worker collective bargaining stretches back nearly a century, and the legal barrier Senate counsel has identified stems from a law first enacted in 1973. 
That law as originally drafted expanded collective bargaining rights to “any person employed by a public employer” with some exceptions, such as elected and appointed officials, administrative heads of departments and offices, and National Guard members. 
In 1977, lawmakers amended the law to define a public employee as “any person in the executive or judicial branch of a government unit,” with similar exceptions still in place —effectively covering workers in two of the three branches of state government, but not legislative staff. 
The omission created what Spilka called a “complex legal area.”  
Supporters say the solution is simple: update the law again to make explicit that legislative staff have the same collective bargaining rights as their peers in executive offices and the judiciary.  
A handful of lawmakers who support the unionization effort have been pressing that idea to no avail. Last term, the Legislature’s State Administration and Regulatory Oversight Committee issued a study order for a bill seeking that change, a move lawmakers often take to kill a measure quietly without a formal vote. 
Former rep. Carol Doherty and Sen. John Keenan filed similar legislation again this term. Their proposals have drawn about 20 cosponsors so far, and will go before a different panel, the Labor and Workforce Development Committee, for a hearing on October 28. 
“We are a union Legislature in a union state,” Keenan said. “In the Legislature, many members seek and obtain union endorsements. We work with unions closely on a lot of different things, and we had our employees asked to form a union. Why wouldn’t we?”  
Doherty died in February, and Elliott stepped in as the chief supporter behind the House version of the bill. 
Pointing to raises and policy changes since the unionization campaign began, Keenan said staff “appreciate” recent improvements but still feel “frustration with things that occur that they don’t have a say in.” 
“When your working conditions, when your wages, when your benefits are being discussed, where there are decisions being made relative to all those, I think it’s fair to be at the table, and I think they’re frustrated that they are not,” he said. 
Some lawmakers have suggested the calculus is not so easy. 
Sen. Will Brownsberger, a member of Spilka’s leadership team, said in 2022 that “a traditional union model does not make sense in the context of the legislative structure in Massachusetts,” where all 40 senators (and all 160 representatives) hire and manage their own aides. 
“In this Legislature, we have Senate offices where Senate staff work for individual senators and they work in small teams,” Brownsberger told the State House News Service after Spilka first detailed her doubts.  
Even if the Labor Committee favorably advances the bill, several larger hurdles would still loom. Legislative leaders could once again keep the measure in limbo until it dies at the end of the two-year term.   
Now in support: the Massachusetts Democratic Party 
The latest boost to the effort came last month, when Massachusetts Democrats gathered for their annual convention.  
While working to put forward language supporting State House staff collective bargaining rights, Simon, who co-chairs the Sudbury Democratic Town Committee, said organizers “heard a lot of shock from people that we didn’t already have collective bargaining rights.” 
No one voiced concerns about the measure during convention debate. The amendment was adopted on a voice vote. 
“It’s a significant political victory. I also think it’s a major moral victory for the party that dominates politics in Massachusetts to say that this is something that is important enough to it to include in the platform,” Simon said. “This issue tests our commitment to collective bargaining rights and whether we are really comfortable saying that all workers deserve those rights.” 
While organizers feel buoyed, the convention’s support might not move the needle. 
Party conventions have long been dominated by progressive activists whose policy stands are regarded as little more than suggestions on Beacon Hill, where actual power is wielded and decisions are made.  
The Massachusetts Democratic Party platform is littered with proposals that have a cloudy future on Beacon Hill. Some are so broad that they would not fit into a single bill, and several others endorse more specific changes that have little to no support among legislative leaders, such as “an end to the state’s punitive use of high-stakes testing” and “a fair and effective economy-wide price on carbon pollution.” 
That points at a broader dynamic: few figures with political power have expended significant capital backing the staff unionization effort. 
As a candidate for governor, Healey signaled her support. A campaign spokesperson told The Boston Globe in 2022 that “Maura continues to support the right of workers, including Senate staff, to organize and collectively bargain.” 
But Healey has said little about the topic in the three and a half years since then. 
Asked about the governor’s current view on the legislative staff unionization effort, a Healey spokesperson declined to comment.

The Massachusetts AFL-CIO supports the staffers who are trying to unionize, and the organization endorsed the Doherty-Keenan bill among dozens of others this cycle. 
“We stand with the rights of every worker to organize a union, whether we’re talking about baristas, State House staff, doctors and custodians, [or] construction workers,” said Mass. AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Kevin Brousseau. “As we look around, we see organizing in every type of workplace right now, because folks really want to make sure they’re having that voice on the job.” 
But the AFL-CIO’s support for legislative aides so far has not extended to direct criticism of the top Democrats who continue to block the effort. 
Brousseau pivoted away from a direct answer when asked if he’s frustrated with the stance Mariano and Spilka have taken toward staff unionization. “I think that workers just want to have a chance,” he replied. “There’s an interest across the board with working people to join a union and have that opportunity, so I think folks really just want to get to the table and have that discussion.” 
The Labor Committee hearing on the latest version of the bill Tuesday could shed more light on the scope of support among legislators and activists. 
Legislative staff in several other jurisdictions have made significant progress on their own collective bargaining efforts in the years since the Massachusetts campaign launched publicly. 
Aides in the Oregon state Legislature similarly joined IBEW, and went on to win a contract in 2023, more than two years after they first voted to unionize. In Washington State, Republican and Democratic staffers ratified separate contracts over the past year after winning the right to organize in 2022. Hundreds of aides who work for the 51-member New York City Council agreed to their first union contract last year. 
And in Washington, DC, Ed Markey became the first senator to voluntarily recognize his aides’ collective bargaining unit, then agreed to “ground rules” for contract negotiations. 
“This has absolutely happened before. It can happen here in Massachusetts,” Woodring said. “We’re not trying to do something new here.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SH-staff-union-sign-at-NCSL-scaled.webp?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

Numerous Democratic lawmakers, including members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation, had written to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins contending the agency could use such funds.
Moreover, the USDA sent a memo to regional SNAP directors instructing them to “take immediate action to implement [the] suspension” of SNAP benefits and notify households that receive them.
“The federal government’s refusal to pay for SNAP benefits in November is unconscionable,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement, “and the absurdity doesn’t end there.”
The governor noted that 460,000 New Mexico residents rely on SNAP, giving the state the highest participation rate in the nation. “The federal government has abandoned its responsibility to feed families.”
The governor reiterated, as her office had on Friday, that her administration is evaluating “every available legal and administrative option under this guidance, working closely with our Health Care Authority, food banks, and community partners to protect vulnerable families — including children, seniors, and people with disabilities.” She also said the state would be expediting $8 million that had for food banks, “though that’s only a fraction of the $80 to $90 million in monthly SNAP benefits New Mexicans rely on.”
New Mexico officials weighing options in advance of lost SNAP benefits

Ending the shutdown, she noted would be “the best way to solve this crisis.”
The pending SNAP shutdown also weighed on the minds of farmers selling over the weekend at Albuquerque’s Downtown Growers’ Market.
Seth Matlick, 41, a north valley farmer, described the stoppage as “definitely bad news — not so much for me, but people need to eat.” He noted that he would be at the market on Nov. 8 with food “and if people lose their benefits, we’ll figure out IOUs or some such.”

(Getty)The Alabama Justice Information Commission said Thursday that dozens of jurisdictions in the state have not yet reported incidents of crime, and plan to pressure local law enforcement agencies for the numbers.
Members of the Alabama Justice Information Commission Thursday voted to summon police departments, sheriffs’ offices and other law enforcement agencies before the commission to explain why they have not electronically submitted their monthly crime data to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, at the risk losing access to a criminal justice information database used to review the information of people they detain as part of their operations.
“You all told us we need to do something to start reminding agencies that they have to report crime to us, so we came up with a letter,” said Maury Mitchell, the state crime information director. “Here is the letter that says, ‘You have not reported to us. You need to start reporting.’”

The formal process to try and compel agencies to comply with the crime reporting requirements comes after the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of ALEA sent out notices to 114 law enforcement jurisdictions throughout the state who did not report their crime figures for at least one of the months in 2025.
A message was left with the Alabama Sheriffs Association seeking comment.
Since the notices were sent, 35 jurisdictions submitted their numbers and another 11 are attempting to submit the information to ALEA. That leaves 68 that have yet to submit their crime numbers to fully comply with the rule, representing about 15% of law enforcement agencies in the state.
The lack of reporting has made it difficult to determine the scope and geography of criminal activity in Alabama, according to the commission. In the summer, the commission directed staff to begin reviewing the logs to look for agencies that did not submit crime data and offer suggestions for gaining compliance. In response, staff developed a letter and sent them to the jurisdictions.
One example was the Columbiana Police Department in Shelby County, which the commission said had not reported their monthly statistics for June, July or August.
“Your agency must comply with the rule or appear before the Alabama Justice Commission in January to show cause for failing to submit as required,” the letter states.
A message was left with the Columbiana Police Department seeking comment.
The letters hinted at consequences for noncompliance, but staff had not obtained an official authorization from the commission that outlined potential consequences. The meeting Thursday formally authorized the process for securing compliance.
Moving forward, agencies that continue to have missing information will be asked to appear before the commission to explain the situation. And those who do not appear will then lose access to the Law Enforcement Tactical System, the database they use to get background information for people they detain.
Agencies may lose their eligibility to receive federal dollars through grants that are administered by the Alabama Department of Community and Economic Affairs.
“To be fair, there are seven regions in the state,” Mitchell said. “We started with ‘A’, then went to ‘B’ and then ‘C’. Each of these folks represent a different region. The last two regions, they just got their notices in the last three days. They have not had a lot of time.”
The commission used a similar tactic for the law enforcement agencies that use LETS, a system that law enforcement to determine the histories and backgrounds of those at traffic stops, such as any outstanding warrants. The commission increased oversight of agencies using LETS that failed privacy protection audits.
The increased pressure comes as the Criminal Justice Information Service division plans to update its administrative rules to compel timelier criminal data reporting.
The rules for reporting crime were established in the 1980s, but Mitchell said that agencies are not following the rules and that the process is outdated. The law states that law enforcement agencies must collect information on reported crimes. The process would ideally start when people first reach out to law enforcement.
“In this case, police are no longer doing that,” Mitchell said. “They are waiting until they send an officer out to the alleged crime scene and then fill this out. The law says, ‘No, it is when somebody reported a crime to a law enforcement agency.’ It has to be documented and notated.The followup is completing the rest of the report.”
Mitchell also said it was not an issue in the past, but that some agencies will take months to report a criminal incident. Members of the commission also authorized the creation of a subcommittee that will recruit law enforcement agencies to review the matter further.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/police-sirens-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

(Photo: Cara Nadler/U.S. Geological Survey)Nevada’s growing reliance on groundwater for irrigation and drinking water has led to significant declines in thousands of wells across the state, according to a recent study.
The study, published in Hydrological Process, analyzed data from about 6,500 wells across Nevada and found that about 40% had significant declines over the last three decades amid intensifying drought and rising water demand – a decline that is expected to put groundwater dependent ecosystems in the state at serious risk.
“That was a little surprising, we didn’t realize it was to that extent,” said Laurel Saito, water strategy director for The Nature Conservancy in Nevada and lead author of the study.
Only about 15% of wells analyzed had increasing water level trends over that same time period. 
In Nevada about half of the state’s counties rely on groundwater for more than 80% of their water supply, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Nevada Division of Water Resources estimates that about 20% of Nevada’s groundwater basins are also being overpumped, meaning more groundwater is extracted than returned each year.
That overuse of groundwater can create a major issue for Nevada’s groundwater-dependent springs, wetlands and riparian habitats which sustain rare plants and wildlife in the state. There are 242 wetland-dependent species recorded by Nevada Division of Natural Heritage – 143 of which can only be found in Nevada.
Researchers warned that declining groundwater could eliminate entire ecosystems and harm struggling species — as seen with the only fish native to Pahrump Valley, the Pahrump poolfish. In the 1970’s, the Pahrump poolfish was removed from its native habitat in Manse Spring when it became clear the spring would go dry due to groundwater pumping. 
Using public data, researchers created a statewide database of groundwater-dependent ecosystems which revealed that at least 40% of them were in basins that had more water rights committed than estimated available groundwater. 
Overall, about 20% of Nevada’s groundwater-dependent habitats were at moderate to high risk for groundwater pumping stress due to excessive groundwater pumping. In habitats that relied on shallow groundwater, like wetlands and playas, about 70% of them were at risk from groundwater pumping due to their location near wells.
A large portion of groundwater-dependent plants, about 40%, were less than half a mile away from wells with significantly declining groundwater. 
“Generally, where you have shallow groundwater, somebody starts pumping there. It is going to affect groundwater-dependent ecosystems, because that’s the groundwater that those ecosystems are usually accessing,” Saito said. 
The study also emphasized that as climate change drives drought in the state, groundwater recharge will dwindle and put further stress on groundwater-dependent ecosystems. 
“We’re likely to have more drought and more intense drought in the future, with Southern Nevada being especially at risk for that,” Saito said. 
More than 40% of springs and 32% of groundwater-depent rivers and streams in Nevada were at high risk of reduced flows in the near-term because they were in areas where groundwater is depleted more quickly. 
“We don’t have a lot of surface water compared to other states, but we have a lot of these groundwater systems, and most of our surface waters are dependent on groundwater. If a stream is flowing year round, it is most likely groundwater dependent,” Saito said. 
Study authors warn that declining groundwater will harm struggling species and increase habitat displacement — as seen with the Pahrump poolfish, which biologists have relocated from drying springs more than once. 
The Pahrump poolfish was removed from its native habitat Manse Spring in the 1970s after it became clear the spring would dry up due to groundwater pumping. The species rebound after being relocated, but remains endangered.
The report outlines several strategies that could help stabilize groundwater levels and provide a roadmap for neighboring Mountain West states. Among them: better well -monitoring, smarter water management, and stronger policies to limit overuse. 
“We found that monitoring springs and groundwater levels was not happening very often, and we really need to be monitoring that so we can have early warnings if flows are declining,” Saito said.
The study also recommends water managers take groundwater-dependent ecosystems into consideration when approving water rights applications or permitting new mines, which use about 10% of groundwater in the state. 
In Nevada the largest use of groundwater is for irrigation, which accounts for about 67% of groundwater use. Municipal use accounts for about 9%.
Saito pointed to Nevada’s Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program – which allows landowners to sell their water rights back to the state – as a good example of conservation policy. The policy, passed by lawmakers last year, allows the state to permanently retire water rights from future allocation to address Nevada’s dwindling groundwater supply.
“That gives us another tool for addressing groundwater overuse,” said Saito. “We’d like to see other ways for people to transition to using less groundwater that gives them time to adjust economically and sustain their livelihoods.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-10-26-25-at-7.26 AM-1024x675.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)It’s hard to listen to former Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley without thinking about what we’ve lost.
Earlier this month, Baxley, who served in the office from 1971 to 1979, spoke at an Southern Poverty Law Center-sponsored event in Birmingham, where he discussed his prosecution of Robert “Dynamite Bob” Chambliss for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church.
It was nothing new for Baxley. He’s discussed the prosecution on TV shows, on National Public Radio and in a Spike Lee documentary.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This time with the death of four children in the house of worship, I thought that exceeded all the bad deeds,” he said at the event.
As anyone with a conscience would. But we should remember the difficult work between the murders and the conviction.
Baxley requested the FBI files on the bombing in 1971, shortly after he took office. He had to wait four years to get them. After the files arrived, it took another year for an investigator to find a reference to Chambliss’ wife’s niece in the original 1963 notes, which opened a path to conviction.
The KKK threatened Baxley, who accused him of prosecuting “Alabama patriots.”  (This provoked the most famous reply in state history: “My response to your letter of February 19, 1976 is – kiss my ass.”) And when he took the case to a jury in 1977, he knew that Chambliss didn’t act alone.
“Don’t you believe this was the only man involved,” Baxley told the jury shortly before they convicted Chambliss of first-degree murder. “We’re not saying he’s the only one. But you’ve got to start somewhere.”
It was hard work. It was incomplete. The prosecution may have hurt Baxley’s gubernatorial campaign in 1978. And yet it was a step toward justice, which Alabama’s Jim Crow regime had done all in its sneering, cynical power to stop.
Baxley was a politician, not a saint. But he channeled his political ambition toward making Alabama a better place. Which you can’t say about current Attorney General Steve Marshall.
The attorney general signed a letter last week addressing the Trump administration’s military strikes on boats in the Caribbean. The White House claims they’re attacking drug traffickers. It has provided zero evidence of that. Even if it did, blowing up boats will do little to stop the flow of drugs. And even if these boats were carrying drugs, those claims must be dealt with in a court of law. Not through high seas lynchings.
So what does Alabama’s chief law enforcement officer think of Trump’s actions?
“I am extremely proud of the President for taking a strong stand and targeting cartel operations,” Marshall said in a statement. “This is exactly the kind of strategic reforms our country deserves.”
The “reform,” in this case, is a thorough abrogation of international law and the possible, even likely killing of innocent people.
But Marshall treats this lawless, bloodthirsty policy — a stain on our character that alienates countries around the world — as a positive step.
That’s consistent with Marshall’s eight years as attorney general. He often shows aversion to the execution of the law. At least as applied to white men.
He took it upon himself to free former Montgomery Police Officer Cody Smith, convicted of manslaughter in the death of Greg Gunn, even taking the case away from the Republican district attorney in Montgomery.
He attended Donald Trump’s trial on charges of fraud in order to denounce the entire process. When the state was ordered to draw two new congressional districts to give Black Alabamians a voice equal to their numbers, Marshall issued a statement comparing proper representation of Alabama citizens to the authoritarian mechanics of Jim Crow, showing either profound historical illiteracy or willful ignorance. You pick.
I don’t expect attorneys general to spend all their time righting historical injustices. Baxley did a lot besides take on the Klan. He forced U.S. Steel to abide by pollution controls, leading to a major improvement in Birmingham’s air quality. He even got a conviction in 1975 against the president of the Public Service Commission, a man whose candidacy he once touted.
You can’t envision Marshall doing any of that. His focus keeps drifting away from Alabama. Marshall would rather go to New York to defend Trump, or file a brief arguing that children in the Empire State should be needlessly exposed to measles. He’s fighting in court right now to stop several states and Boulder, Colorado from suing Exxon over climate change.
Marshall seems to view his office as a platform for conservative fever dreams and a launchpad for his hopes for higher office. President Trump is the rocket fuel. So if the president violates basic legal standards, Marshall will not only cheer; he’ll grab the pom-poms.
It’s quite a change from the 1970s. Bill Baxley pursued the rule of law even when it led to political difficulties. To Steve Marshall, there’s no greater political difficulty than the rule of law.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0331-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

Here’s what you need to know.","At the start of a new school year, the number of children reporting severe mental health needs increases. Many face anxiety and stress as they transition back to a daily school schedule. 
For Connecticut families with children in need of mental health care, urgent crisis centers offer emergency treatment. UCCs aim to support children experiencing mental health crises by providing access to treatment and support.
Here’s what you need to know about these centers and what they can do for kids. 
What is an urgent crisis center?
Urgent crisis centers are state funded, privately operated facilities that offer treatment for children with emergency mental health needs. They function as an alternative to hospital emergency departments, enabling children to stay in their homes during treatment as opposed to inpatient hospital care.
They are equipped to handle crises such as thoughts of suicide or self-harm, feelings of depression or anxiety, substance misuse and more. However, they are not emergency departments equipped to provide immediate medical attention. For medical emergencies, the centers direct families to call 911 or visit the nearest hospital. 
For children and teens aged 18 and under, the centers’ trained staff work to deescalate mental health crises, complete evaluations and connect youth to services. Most forms of insurance are accepted across the centers. Around half of the children treated at UCCs in Connecticut have Medicaid insurance.
To serve residents of more rural areas of Connecticut, the urgent crisis centers also work with emergency mobile crisis intervention services, also referred to by providers as mobile crisis centers, which bring similar services to children’s homes, to ensure that immediate mental health needs are addressed. 
How do you access them?
There are four locations in Connecticut: Hartford, New Haven, New London and Waterbury. They operate as walk-ins and provide immediate access to mental health resources. There are 72 daily slots at each center and no appointments are needed. 
In Hartford, families can visit The Village for Families and Children. On Monday through Friday, they are open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.. On Saturday and Sunday, they are open from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. 
In New Haven, families can visit Yale New Haven Hospital. Emergency medical care for children is also offered at all times at each Emergency Department and urgent care facility across the Yale New Haven Health System.
In New London, families can visit The Child and Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut. They are open Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.. 
In Waterbury, families can visit the Wellmore Behavioral Health, a nonprofit that operates the crisis center. To make a referral or get help, the center advises families to call 1-855-WELLMORE. 
How successful have they been?
In 2022, state legislation established UCCs in response to increased demand for mental health care, citing a spike in youth suicides since the pandemic. They began operating the following year. Since opening, thousands of children have visited these centers, and over 95% of visitors have been able to return home after their visit without going to the emergency room. 
“That is a phenomenal success rate. It’s a success rate we don’t see in most other services that we provide,” said Hector Glynn, chief executive officer at The Village for Families & Children.
Parents whose children have received treatment at the centers have said they were pleased with the support the UCCs offer. “They will take care of your child. It’s become our safe haven,” Lisa Paradis, a parent whose daughter has received treatment at the crisis centers, said last month.
How are they sustained?
Despite favorable outcomes, the future of UCCs and mobile crisis centers is threatened by a lack of funding. 
Funding for UCCs mainly relies on allocations in the state budget through Medicaid. But about half of the clients the centers see aren’t covered under Medicaid, meaning the centers can’t access much of that money. Plus, private insurance typically has lower reimbursement rates than Medicaid. Many privately insured patients also have high-deductible health care plans and can’t pay fees. When they can’t pay, the nonprofits write off the debt.
The mobile crisis program got about $8.6 million in fiscal year 2027, but nothing in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1. This summer, state officials were considering looking for unspent COVID relief money to carry the centers through the end of the year and “braid any other additional funding that may be needed” to sustain their operations through 2027.
The centers are looking to explore policy changes with lawmakers to alleviate the financial burden.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/UCC_Monk-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-27 07:56:54.921101

Sign up for their newsletter here.
At the eastern edge of America’s “breadbasket” region, Michigan’s Saline Township is a quintessential agricultural community. The township is home to 2,200 residents, several family-owned farms and a small historic district—and a hyperscale data center will soon join the list.
The Saline Township Board voted earlier this month to settle a lawsuit in which development firm Related Digital and the landowners of the proposed construction site accused the township of exclusionary zoning, or of unfairly limiting what property owners can do and build on their land. This lawsuit, filed Sept. 12, came just two days after the board voted 4–1 against rezoning the site’s 575 acres of farmland for the company’s data center project.
A county judge certified the settlement last week, bringing a sudden end to the dispute amid intense opposition from Saline Township residents and elected officials, who expressed concern at public meetings regarding traffic, noise, and water and energy resources.
“We’re a farming rural township, and that’s what we want to stay,” said James Marion, supervisor of the Township Board.
Alongside the rest of the board, Marion attended several public meetings about the data center and lawsuit, and says most of the township is opposed to the project. However, much of the board ultimately bowed to the legal pressure from Related Digital.
“I still voted against it,” Marion said. “I said, ‘Well, if we lose in court, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.’”
Marion’s vote against the settlement ended up standing alone. This month, after a two-hour closed-door meeting, the township’s board voted 4–1 to settle, avoiding a lawsuit that Marion said the township’s attorneys painted as difficult to win. The settlement includes provisions to restore the land if the data center goes unused, preserve existing wild spaces, and invest several million dollars in the community annually.
“We are pleased by the Board’s vote and that we were able to reach a resolution that allows this important project to move forward in a responsible way,” Natalie Ravitz, Related Digital’s executive vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement.





While the developer won out in Saline Township, versions of this fight are playing out across the country. There are currently 4,080 data centers in the United States, up over 30 percent from 3,059 in December 2023. As artificial intelligence continues to drive the data center industry’s growth, many of the companies behind these developments are choosing to build in rural areas where land is cheaper.
In rural communities as close to Saline as nearby Howell Township—where the township’s board similarly voted against rezoning a tract of land for data center development—and as far away as Texas, community members are railing against data center projects popping up in their backyards.


Data Center Watch, a research firm that tracks opposition to data center projects, estimates that $64 billion worth of data center projects have been blocked or delayed due to community opposition as of March 2025, and that number is still growing.
Last month, this fight reached Congress. U.S. Reps. Jim Costa, D-Calif., and Blake Moore, R-Utah, introduced H.R.5227, or the “Unleashing Low-Cost Rural AI Act,” which would require the federal departments of Energy, Interior and Agriculture to collaborate on a study of how data centers are impacting rural America.
“My legislation ensures we take a hard look at how this growth impacts rural communities that are powering the AI industry, and make sure families aren’t left paying the price,” Costa said in a statement. “But at the same time, it’s important that rural communities are not left behind in the new opportunities that AI data centers will provide for agricultural sciences and an improved ability to compete in this modern era.”
The concern, for many experts, is that communities may end up with depleted resources or surging energy costs that aren’t proportional to the benefit the data center brings to the area. Because rural communities often lack a robust local staff equipped to fully analyze data centers’ long-term impacts, these adverse outcomes are common, said Tim Cywinski, communications director of the Sierra Club’s chapter in Virginia, where 35 percent of all hyperscale data centers globally are located, mostly in rural counties within the state. He considers the extension of data center development into rural areas “a justice issue” with outsized impacts on communities’ quality of life.
“It’s kind of a bait and switch for people who bought into the peaceful, rural lifestyle,” Cywinski said. “Then, next thing you know, they’re going to build giant AI data centers … right by their homes.”
One of the difficulties for local leaders and community members analyzing data centers’ impacts is that—like any large-scale industrial activity—data centers vary significantly from project to project. Currently, there are few “standard answers” about how a data center will impact the community around it, said Sarah Mills, manager of the University of Michigan’s Office of Climate and Energy, which helps communities plan for energy development.
Mills said the lack of standardization is why it’s so helpful to take a proactive approach, reevaluating land uses and deciding what the community can handle before large projects come to town.
“I think this [shift] is an invitation, an opportunity for rural communities to really assess what it is that they care about and want to be in the future,” she said.
In Saline Township, this assessment happened at a breakneck pace, as residents filed into jam-packed town hall meetings, determined to ask the right questions about the lawsuit and the project’s long-term impacts even as Related Digital turned up the heat on the township’s decision-making, advising the township’s lawyers they planned to amend their complaint to include a claim for monetary damages if a settlement was not reached.
The company’s complaint rested on the claim that not having any plots of land zoned to allow data centers constitutes exclusionary zoning.
Laws prohibiting exclusionary zoning started appearing in the early 1900s, aiming to combat zoning practices that kept lower-income or minority populations out of wealthier areas. These practices often prevented affordable housing development, keeping costs high and reinforcing segregation.
In Michigan, however, zoning can also be considered exclusionary if a zoning classification—such as one allowing for certain types of industrial buildings—exists in a given township, but no land is actually designated for that use. Related Digital argues this reinterpretation of exclusionary zoning applies to Saline Township.
“Although the Township has a rezoning classification that would permit such a [data center] development (the ‘I-1’ zoning), it is mere window dressing,” Related Digital’s attorneys wrote in the complaint, noting that no property is currently zoned for I-1 uses, and the township’s future land use map doesn’t identify any properties they plan to rezone.
In hopes of assuaging residents’ concerns and urging them to accept the rezoning, Related Digital was on the ground in Saline Township, meeting with residents and clarifying misconceptions about the project’s water use and noise.
“The biggest misunderstanding, frankly, is that people have heard about other data center projects, many of which have hundreds of generators,” said Related Digital’s Ravitz. “That’s not the case with this project.”
Despite being large enough to accommodate an unnamed “large American publicly-traded technology company” as a client, the data center will not rely on noisy generators and will use an air-cooling system to limit water use, Ravitz explained. In fact, the only water used on-site, she said, will be for employee restrooms and fire suppression tanks outside, which the local fire department will also have access to for other fires within the township.
Beyond these conditions, the settlement also ensures the project will be developed on only 250 acres of the property; will preserve remaining acreage as undeveloped or agricultural lands; will never be sold to a tax-exempt entity; and, if decommissioned, the developer will restore the lands as a natural area. While the facility is in use, the company will also annually contribute at least $1.6 million to the township and $8 million to local schools and will make one-time donations of $14 million to the township’s fire services, farmland preservation trust, and community investment fund.
With these concessions in place, the company hopes to break ground on the data center as early as next year, with the goal of having it up and running as early as 2027. Some residents, meanwhile, are still reeling from the quick end to the dispute.

With the federal shutdown entering its fourth week, spurred by a stalemate over the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans on Affordable Care Act plans, a new report shows that over 154 million people with coverage through an employer also face steep price hikes — and that the situation is likely to get worse.
Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
It’s the first time in two decades that the cost of covering a family of four has risen by 6% or more for three consecutive years, data from KFF shows.
Over the last five years, the average premium for family coverage has increased by 26%, compared with a 29% increase in workers’ wages and nearly 24% growth in inflation. The average cost for family coverage is now about the same as a new Toyota Corolla hybrid.
The average annual premium for an individual health plan provided by employers increased by 5% to $9,325 — nearly $3,000 higher than in 2016, according to the survey.
“It’s a concern as health costs just keep going up,” said Eric Trump, controller at Steve Reiff Inc., a small company in South Whitley, Indiana, that specializes in sandblasting and painting heavy equipment.
Trump, who is not related to President Donald Trump, said his company’s health insurance costs rose 8% for the 2026 fiscal year — roughly the same as they have in the last few years.
Workers at Reiff pay about half the cost of their health coverage. About half of its 20 current employees decline the insurance because they get coverage through a family member or choose to go uninsured, he said. “There’s not a lot we can do as we don’t have enough employees to spread out the costs.”
Most people with job-based insurance contribute to the cost of their premiums, with the average worker this year contributing $1,440 for individual coverage or $6,850 for family coverage.
Over time, more workers have paid increasingly higher deductibles, the amount they must spend out-of-pocket on medical services before their insurer pitches in. More than one‑third of covered workers are enrolled in a plan with a deductible of $2,000 or more for an individual. The share of workers with such a plan has increased 32% over the last five years and 77% over the last 10 years, the report said.
Rising drug and hospital costs are often cited as major culprits for rising health insurance costs, and neither shows signs of ebbing.
“Early reports suggest that cost trends will be higher for 2026, potentially leading to higher premium increases unless employers and plans find ways to offset higher costs through changes to benefits, cost sharing, or plan design,” the KFF survey said.
One big concern among employers is the high price of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, which a growing number of companies cover. Their high prices, combined with strong demand, have led some workplaces to tighten or eliminate coverage for weight loss.
“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” study author Gary Claxton, a KFF senior vice president, said in a press release. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
Employers typically respond to higher health costs by shifting costs to their workers, but it’s unclear how much more financial pain workers can take. The survey found nearly half of large employers said their employees have “moderate” or “high” concerns about their level of cost sharing.
While the rising cost of employer-sponsored insurance has outpaced general inflation, the issue received scant attention in recent months on Capitol Hill. To help pay for extending tax cuts, Trump’s tax and spending law reduces by billions of dollars the amount the government spends on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for 70 million low-income and disabled people. Congressional budget scorekeepers predict the cuts to Medicaid will lead to millions more people becoming uninsured over the next decade.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Democrats refuse to vote for a new spending measure unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits that help about 22 million people buy health coverage through the ACA marketplaces. Without congressional action, the tax credits will expire, and premiums will double for many consumers, starting in January.
The KFF report is based on a survey this year of 1,862 randomly selected nonfederal public and private employers with 10 or more workers.

Neither leading candidate offers specifics on how they would tackle them. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]New Jersey’s next governor will be faced with major changes to Medicaid, with more than half a million New Jerseyans likely navigating new work requirements by the end of next year and an eventual loss of about $2.5 billion in federal aid annually.
The leading candidates for governor — Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D) — both pledge to protect health care for New Jersey’s most vulnerable residents as the changes to Medicaid championed by the Trump administration start to take full effect. But they have very different views on what it means for the state budget, the health care system, and the 1.9 million residents who receive care through the state’s Medicaid program, NJ Family Care, many of whom have low income or a disability. 
Democrat Mikie Sherrill said she would fight to protect children’s access to doctors and battle President Donald Trump to recover federal funds slated to soon disappear. Republican Jack Ciattarelli said people who are truly eligible for Medicaid can count on him to protect their care. Both say the other is wrong for New Jersey.
“Jack supports Trump’s efforts to rip away health care from more than 300,000 New Jerseyans and double premiums for another 450,000. Jack is one of the loudest cheerleaders for Trump’s budget that is detrimental to New Jersey,” said Sherrill campaign spokesperson Sam Chan. “While Jack talks a big game about being a CPA, his math just doesn’t add up.”
Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell, meanwhile, noted that Sherrill’s party has controlled the governor’s office for eight years and the Legislature for more than two decades.
“Democrats completely control Trenton and look at what has happened to the state. Why would we give Phil Murphy his third term with Mikie Sherrill?” Russell said.
Neither candidate offered specifics on how they would sustain the program as federal funding declines, or fund the cost of caring for New Jerseyans who lose coverage, but both on the campaign trail stress the need to make health care in general more accessible and affordable. Ciattarelli and Sherrill are seeking to replace Murphy, a Democrat who is barred from seeking a third term this year. Election Day is Nov. 4. Early in-person voting is underway.

By 2032, the changes launched by the Trump administration are expected to cost New Jersey more than $3 billion annually in Medicaid dollars, according to state policy analysts. An estimated 350,000 low-income residents will have lost NJ Family Care coverage, they said. Federal support for child welfare, food aid, and other services has also been slashed under Trump, further reducing revenue for New Jersey programs. 
Sherrill, in her fourth term in Congress, has warned these shifts would be dangerous to residents and the state budget, and said during the first gubernatorial debate in September that the federal actions “will imperil the health care of 1 in 3 children” nationwide. Medicaid spending comprises more than 40% of the current state budget of nearly $60 billion.
In response to a question about changes in Medicaid, Chan, the Sherrill campaign spokesperson, said Sherrill “will take on anyone to ensure that New Jersey’s children don’t lose access to their doctor.”
“As governor, she will work to ensure we have the resources to ensure people can afford to see their doctor. Mikie will take Trump to court to claw back as much money as we can, develop innovative partnerships with health care providers and hospitals to provide preventive care at a low cost, and crack down on tax cheats at the state level and use this funding to lower costs for New Jersey families,” Chan said.
Ciattarelli, a retired businessman who has served in local, county, and state government, has largely downplayed the potential impact of changes to Medicaid and said his positive relationship with Trump, who endorsed him, will benefit New Jersey more than Sherrill’s legal threats. He said government spending on the state and federally funded health care program has increased in ways that are unsustainable, prompting a need for reform. 
“I promise you that no vulnerable populations will be underserved in New Jersey under Governor Ciattarelli. Somehow, someway we will make sure they are taken care of,” Ciattarelli said at a Nutley campaign event earlier this month.

New Jersey allocated $24.3 billion for Medicaid through next spring in the budget Murphy signed in late June, of which $14.9 billion is expected from Washington, D.C. In addition to funding health insurance benefits and subsidizing hospitals — more than $2.6 billion this year, much of it for care in poor communities — the program pays for roughly 40% of all births in New Jersey and almost two-thirds of nursing home beds.
Russell, the Ciattarelli campaign strategist, said as governor, the Republican would “set responsible spending priorities and pull the plug” on funding for the pet projects of Democratic lawmakers. Those projects added $700 million to the current state budget. Democrats now hold majorities in the Assembly, where all 80 seats are up for election this year, and in the Senate.
“The idea that state money doesn’t exist to fund key priorities, whether that be health care, infrastructure, or education, is simply unfounded,” Russell said, pointing to budget growth in recent years. “Jack has said repeatedly that as governor, people who qualify for Medicaid and rely on the program will be taken care of under a Ciattarelli Administration.”
The most immediate change coming to Medicaid is the addition of work requirements for most adults, a provision that would impact some 550,000 people in New Jersey, according to policy experts at the state Department of Human Services, which runs the program. By 2027, adults must spend — and be able to document — at least 20 hours a week at a job, in school, or performing community service. Women who are pregnant or have recently given birth, caring for someone who is disabled or under age 13, or attending addiction treatment would be exempt, they said. 
The work requirements, which studies show have not been highly successful elsewhere, come with changes to Medicaid rules that force participants to verify they are eligible twice a year, instead of just once, as is now the case. Policy experts predict the new rules will lead some 350,000 residents to drop their NJ Family Care plans, reducing the cost to the federal government. 
Over time the additional red tape is also likely to double the workload for state and county employees, state policy experts say.
Ciattarelli has echoed national Republicans in describing the work requirements and eligibility changes as fair and necessary to protect the program’s integrity.
Ciattarelli also defended Trump’s insistence on implementing nationwide work requirements in Medicaid (states havesignificant control in how these are established).
“It’s not to be mean. It’s because billions are being wasted on people who are scamming the system,” he told the cheering crowd in Nutley. “So what measures do you put in to stop the scamming of the system?”
Medicaid is monitored at the state and federal levels to identify fraud and other problems, with New Jersey watchdogs identifying more than $1 billion in fraud, overpayments, or wrongful payments in the past decade. But experts note these improprieties are not as common, or as costly, as Republicans suggest. 
Ciattarelli said he also supports removing undocumented immigrants from the program. New Jersey is one of 14 states, plus Washington, D.C., that use local tax dollars to insure undocumented children, according to non-partisan health care advocates at KFF, and it expects to spend about $164 million this year to cover 47,000 of these youngsters. 
Federal changes to Medicaid will also end coverage for various legal immigrants starting next year, which state experts said will remove some 25,000 people from NJ Family Care, including refugees and victims of domestic violence and human trafficking.
The full financial impact of the federal Medicaid changes starts to take effect in 2028, in the middle of the next governor’s four-year term in office. That’s when the new law begins to limit how states can use Medicaid to generate funding for hospitals and other services, an approach New Jersey has embraced under Murphy. 
New Jersey has used much of this revenue to replace charity care, the longstanding hospital aid program that relies more heavily on state tax dollars than Medicaid. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid eligibility and created the market that sells Obamacare plans, started to drive down charity care numbers a decade ago. The increased reliance on Medicaid for hospital subsidies shrank the budget line even more, from $349 million in 2022 to less than $70 million in the current budget.

One area of potential labor growth is in the health care sector, with a recent uptick of union organizing petitions. But the report also noted new challenges and political strain are on the horizon, including budget cuts, unfair labor practices and new anti-labor laws considering signals from federal and state leaders.
Still, researchers said that the Michigan labor movement netted important recent wins in complaint cases decided by the National Labor Relations Board and the Michigan Supreme Court. Additionally, union representation petitions in the health care sector continue to grow, the report noted, with an influx of increasingly progressive locally-based and nationally-affiliated campaigns emerging amid what Wayne State researchers called “new and militant contract battles.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That shows Michigan health care workers are becoming more cognizant of their labor’s value to their employers and the communities they serve.
“New developments in the economic landscape gave rise to increased labor activism, augmenting the state’s reputation as a labor hub, as industries and workplaces continued to expand,” the report said. “Chief among these changes has been the expansion of union representation in higher education and more active labor representation among health care workers. Also, relatively new on the labor front are the expanded efforts of low-wage, temporary, and precariously employed service workers in retail, food and beverage service, and transportation.”
On the medical front, Wayne State’s research shows that Michigan has a long history of being friendly toward health care organizing. Its growth as an industry has emerged as manufacturing in the state reduces volume, with health care now not too far behind as one of the largest state industries.
Illinois, Michigan see union membership gains after state policy changes

With 13.5% of Michigan’s workforce belonging to a union and 14.7% of the total workforce being actively represented by a union, health care organizing remains strong and has room to grow. 
As of 2025, the sector has 25 unique health systems, and overall, health care workers have tended to affiliate with non-traditional health care unions, like Teamsters, the UAW and the American Federation of Teachers.
The report hailed organizing efforts at Corewell Health. 
Per the report, Metro Detroit stands out as the central hub for union organizing in the state, with a disproportionate share of the state’s union locals and a Detroit-centric base for unique union types.

Other strong pockets of union organizing include Lansing, Saginaw, Grand Rapids and Muskegon.
Although organized labor fought for the the earned sick time and wage increase ballot measures in 2018, which were the subject of a protracted legal fight over the Michigan Legislature’s “adopt and amend” tactics that gutted the measures, the report did highlight the legislative deal that kept some of those measures intact while softening them at the behest of employers and tipped-wage workers across the state.
From 2020 onward, several federal actions have shaped the dynamic in Michigan, but the resurgence of President Donald Trump is challenging that trend.
On Right to Work laws, Wayne State’s research shows that Michigan is still recovering from the era of lower wages due to lack of union representation and restricted collective bargaining. Since its repeal took effect in 2024, Michigan saw a 17,000 person increase in union membership
There are areas of improvement, however, as only 13.4% of all Michigan employees are unionized, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is well above the national average, though.
Some of that could change if Republicans take back control of the Michigan Senate next year and also take the governor’s office, assuming that the GOP holds the House, as well. 
Both House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) have said the Democratic trifecta of the past few years was wrong to repeal the law. Hall would likely remain as House speaker if the Republicans remain in control of the lower chamber. Nesbitt is angling for the GOP nomination for the governor’s seat. And state Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell) has already introduced a GOP Senate plan to reinstate Right to Work, which currently has no path forward with Democrats still in control of the upper chamber.
That said, the repeal hasn’t protected every union member in the state of Michigan. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME from 2018 placed Right to Work-style restrictions on public employees. Of note, private sector employees benefitted from the repeal, but laborers like school employees, state workers, police officers, firefighters, nurses, janitors and secretaries in government positions did not.
“As we have shown, Michigan union density has been recovering in the last few years,” the report said in conclusion. “The state labor movement is regaining ground. As the movement continues to grow, there will be uncertainty; but the trends leading into 2025 show a renewed spirit in Michigan unions.”

Washington’s independent office investigating police deadly force incidents plans to name its second region in the coming weeks and pair it with a roadmap for opening the remaining regions statewide.
Office of Independent Investigations Director Roger Rogoff said in an Inside Olympia interview with Austin Jenkins that the announcement would come before the end of the year, adding that the agency will also lay out when the final four regions will open after that. 
Rogoff defended the mission behind the state’s new approach to police deadly-force investigations, calling the model “a really good idea — even a really divine idea.”

The agency’s balancing act — hiring some former law enforcement officers while guarding independence — is “the magic of the agency,” he said. Rogoff says “transparency is the product,” citing plain-language final reports and the agency’s family and tribal liaison programs as tangible examples.
Since taking the lead in Region 1 last December, the office has handled five fatal-force callouts, completed two investigations (in Vancouver and Centralia), and has three pending (in Poulsbo, Ridgefield and Vancouver). Rogoff says all three will be completed by year’s end, while the office is still reviewing six cases that occurred before it was created.
Rogoff said the statutory goal of issuing reports within 120 days is “aggressive,” citing forensic turnaround times and the work required to write comprehensive summaries. “I think that six months, 180 days, is probably a lot more reasonable,” he said.
The new agency had its capacity tested on May 7, when two fatal cases came in the same night. The office split resources and covered both scenes. Rogoff said he was “incredibly proud of my staff” that night — though he added, “If there had been a third one, we would not have been able to do it.”
Staffing remains the choke point. The Office of Independent Investigations has 66 employees, including 31 investigators. “I think we need over 100 investigators,” Rogoff said — far above the agency’s initial concept. For the upcoming supplemental budget in the 2026 legislative session, Rogoff said they have asked for funding for five more investigators.
Recently, the office opened a new headquarters and evidence facility in Thurston County. Rogoff described the 11,000 square feet of evidence storage space and 9,000 square feet of office space as a major step forward. Meanwhile, a more than 20% budget cut that came in the 2025–27 biennial state budget “slows us down” and hits a new agency harder than an established one.
“Let’s make it work,” is his message to lawmakers. “Let’s finish the job.”

But that is changing. (Getty Images)“Bail reform” is a term worthy to send chills down the spine of any law enforcement officer, prosecuting attorney and survivor of crime. Indiana has not been at the extreme edge of change nationally in this area, but that is likely a good thing, as we can learn from the failures of other jurisdictions. 
Bail reform in Indiana has proceeded incrementally and, in my mind, is woefully incomplete at this point. Our legislature and all voting-aged Hoosiers will soon have the opportunity to see the bail reform project finally fill in the missing  piece. 
Almost 10 years ago, the Indiana Supreme Court instituted a pilot program aimed at maximizing release at the pretrial stage of criminal cases. After two years in 11 pilot counties, Criminal Rule 26 went into effect in January 2018. The rule created a system, albeit imperfect, that addresses injustices for certain non-violent offenders. 
Geared toward releasing non-violent or “low-risk” offenders without onerous conditions, this process aims to mitigate the loss of liberty when an  individual is unable to post money bail for want of those resources. The process instead focused on “evidence-based practices” and uses a pretrial screening tool to project the risk of an arrestee’s failure to appear at future hearings. 
In implementing the rule, the court stated that the primary purpose was “to maximize the likelihood of an accused person’s presence at trial while striving for both public safety and protection of the presumption of  innocence.” 
However, this reform provided improved tools to trial court judges for only one end of the arrestee spectrum; it is high time for us to address the other end by putting an emphasis on public safety. 
Proposal seeks to change Constitution — and who has right to bail in Indiana

At least 22 states and the federal government allow the most dangerous arrestees to be held without bail, and Indiana judges should have that discretion to protect the public in that way. 
Early steps toward this concept of “preventative detention” are underway. In its 2023 session, the General Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 1, which would amend Article I, Section 17 of the Indiana Constitution to allow for offenses other than murder and treason to not be bailable “if: (1) the proof is evident or the presumption strong; and (2) the state  proves by clear and convincing evidence that no release conditions will reasonably protect  the safety of any other person or the community.” 
The constitutional amendment process requires the language to pass out of a separate General Assembly before going to the ballot for Hoosiers to approve. Merely amending the constitution will not be the end of the story. 
Instead, amended or new statutes will need to provide additional details about the process to ensure public safety as prosecutors seek to keep dangerous individuals in custody in order to protect the public. 
The protection of victims and communities as a whole, is a critical purpose of the bail and release system. 
Not only does the start of the amendment process reflect the political will to engage in these further reforms, but the most recent legislative session also produced meaningful change through Public Law 197, which directs that arrestees for crimes of violence are to be detained until a hearing is held by the court to set bail individually and in open court. 
Indiana’s trial court judges need the tools and the flexibility to address the needs of each particular situation. Forbidding strategies like cash bail, or mandating release when not otherwise required, would unduly restrict the discretion and duties of the state’s trial courts, whose judges every day must weigh appropriate factors and craft safe and effective conditions of release. 
In the next year or two, we have the opportunity to provide balance to Indiana’s bail reform and thereby to improve public safety outcomes through a robust and constitutionally valid procedure. Indiana’s trial court judges need these tools, and prosecutors need the ability to argue for their use in the service of public safety.

Hoosier child care providers are scrabbling for ways to stay open as Indiana’s freeze on low-income vouchers cramps enrollment and double-digit reimbursement rate cuts eat away at already narrow margins.
Providers collectively stand to lose an estimated $3.8 million a week — almost $200 million a year — according to Early Learning Indiana, a prominent child education advocacy group and site operator.
“I don’t know where we’re going to be standing at,” said Jonathan Prewitt, who’s operated in-home programs in New Albany since 2011. “… I’m not saying that we’re going to be in business much longer. I’m hoping that we could … because our kids need us.”

All of Prewitt’s clients pay with vouchers, which previously covered the cost of attendance at Pit Stop for Kids. Not anymore.
“My parents depend on that, and they can’t afford to pay the difference,” he said. But he can’t afford to absorb the losses.
Some providers are mobilizing to swap survival strategies, protest the state’s changes or get trained on advocating with lawmakers.
“This crisis has created new collaboration,” said Hanan Osman, executive director of the Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children. “… We need to figure out how to resolve this before it’s too late.”
Advocates say the cuts hurt more than just an industry.
“There is really no second chance for this time of life, to make the kind of change that we can within the architecture of the brain, when children are in responsive and caring environments with learning opportunities around them,” said Maureen Weber, president and CEO of Early Learning Indiana.
No exit
Low-income Hoosier families can nab vouchers through two child care assistance programs: the federal Child Care and Development Fund and the state-level On My Way Pre-K.
About 35,000 children typically participated pre-pandemic, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
That swelled to nearly 68,000 children in the final months of 2024 — the waning days of former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration.

FSSA put the jump in demand down to broadened income eligibility, state capacity-building grants and federal funding when, in December, it implemented the first waitlist for child care vouchers since 2018.
“We had, essentially, an extra billion dollars in early care and education through the various rounds of COVID relief funds,” Weber explained. “And those funded a variety of things, but one of them was to fuel that increase in vouchers.”
“Given the other decisions that the state might have made with those dollars, serving more children seems like a good one,” she continued. “I think what we didn’t do was have sort of the smoothest exit plan to bring those numbers back down, which is why we have now the really concentrated change that we’re all experiencing.”
When Gov. Mike Braun took office in January, he proposed allocating $362 million to child care vouchers — enough to close the waitlist.
Lawmakers scrapped that.

Instead, they set aside $147 million in “hold harmless” funding for the 2026 fiscal year, which began July 1. It’s enough to renew vouchers at the same income requirements for families already on the program.
New enrollees face narrower standards.
FSSA is focusing on funding current participants, and “is not issuing new vouchers for 2025,” a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
Nearly 30,000 children were languishing on the waitlist in August, according to an agency subsidy dashboard. That’s the latest data available.
OMWPK vouchers were curtailed for the current school year: there’s a cap of 2,500 enrollees that can each receive a maximum of $6,800 in funding, narrower eligibility thresholds and other changes.
And last month, FSSA announced double-digit reimbursement rate cuts for CCDF vouchers: down 10% for infant and toddler care, 15% for preschoolers and a whopping 35% for school-age children.
Braun’s FSSA pinned the blame on the Holcomb administration.
“These adjustments address a $225 million funding gap through 2026 created by the prior administration’s unsustainable use of temporary COVID relief funds and ensure continued compliance with federal requirements,” a news release said.
The rates went into effect Oct. 5, with the first pay date being Nov. 6.
Children with vouchers were at least 25% of clients at almost half the state’s 4,300 providers in a March analysis by Early Learning Indiana.
“We’re a really low-margin industry,” Weber said.
“If a quarter of your payers are from the public sector, and some big portion of those are going away, there’s vulnerability there,” she added. But she’s most concerned about the 900 “highly dependent” providers with at least 75% of clients using vouchers.
Voucher losses are hitting Hoosier providers at an estimated $1.9 million weekly, while reimbursement rate cuts subtract another $1.8 million weekly, according to an Early Learning Indiana dashboard unveiled this month. It breaks down the impacts by county.
Cutting back
Providers say they’re feeling the impacts — and making adjustments.
“The pressures are high,” said the Rev. Jay Height, executive director of Shepherd Community Center in Indianapolis’ Eastside, where about 65% of children pay with vouchers.
The organization had about 70 seats, but enrollment has fallen closer to 60. Some have just aged out, but others have lost their vouchers.
“There’s no way for them to pay for it,” Height said. “We’re trying to put more emphasis on working with our families to help make sure that they keep their vouchers and don’t let it lapse or miss any deadlines.”

The organization is exploring group purchasing and teacher-sharing; working with a company to examine utility expenses for possible savings; and trying to raise funds.
The cuts have prompted a laundry list of changes at Little Duckling Early Learning Schools’ neighboring buildings along 38th Street, where more than 80% of students pay with vouchers.
The sites were at 92% capacity this time last year, but are down to 68%, according to Site Director Jacqueline Strong.
“We … never had a problem with enrolling. Our biggest issue, if there was an enrollment problem, was just having space,” said Strong, who’s worked at Little Duckling for six years.
Some families are using their vouchers at elementary schools, but others are locked out — on the waitlist and unable to cover total costs themselves.
Little Duckling has closed four classrooms and moved those students and teachers to the building next door. “With us not getting the new infants that we would’ve normally gotten,” Strong said, three infant rooms with capacity for 24 have dwindled to a single room with capacity for eight.
The organization prides itself on its accredited child development and academic programs — even infants and toddlers have curriculums and lesson plans — but those materials have been halved to save money.
Little Duckling has nixed free events like field trips and “donuts with dad,” cut back on professional development opportunities, lowered pay for new hires and more. Parents of young children must provide their own diapers.
Dozens of providers gathered at Little Duckling this month to share ideas on saving money without dropping their standards.
The lower reimbursement rates are “not enough to sustain what is considered a high-quality program,” Strong said.

It’s possible to run a child care center for less money, “but … you’re not able to all of the extra things that a high-quality program would normally do, because you won’t have funds,” she added.
Little Duckling has a third site, located in a higher-income area along 82nd Street. A lower share of students use vouchers, so it hasn’t been as impacted, according to Strong.
Early Learning Indiana’s Weber predicted conditions will worsen as the reimbursement rates take hold this autumn.
Her group runs nine centers in Indianapolis, with about a third of students paying with vouchers. They’re losing $10,000 a week.
Still, the 125-year-old organization is “relatively well situated to weather the storm,” Weber acknowledged. She warned others don’t have the operating reserves to survive.
Early Learning Indiana has some philanthropic money it uses to support providers across the state, but it’s “a problem at the scale of government, to be candid,” Weber said. “I mean, it’s a multiple hundreds of millions of dollars problem.”
Learning advocacy
Some providers are taking action.
Prewitt, of Pit Stop for Kids, is gathering fellow New Albany-area operators to attend FSSA’s next quarterly financial reporting meeting Wednesday, with plans to rally after the child care discussion ends.
He worries his parents will have to quit their jobs to take care of their children, or keep working and leave them home alone. Older kids might get into trouble, Prewitt fears, or be deputized into caretakers themselves for younger siblings.
“Indiana chose to do this,” he said. “Why they chose to take from our kids instead of taking from one of them higher ups’ pockets or salary makes no sense.”
Other providers are gathering, like at Little Duckling. They’re weighing in at listening sessions with the Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, and they’re getting trained.
The association just wrapped up a two-day advocacy and leadership academy in Indianapolis, attended by about 70 early childhood educators, according to Osman.
The agenda includes breakout sessions to learn how to write an op-ed, how to approach news outlets or how to speak with lawmakers.
“One of the things we (have) learned over the years is that we cannot be angry when we talk to a legislator,” Osman said. “We have to use numbers. We have to be positive. We have to show the collaborative.”
The association doesn’t organize protests or endorse political candidates in line with its nonprofit status.
Instead, it’s compiling testimonials and preparing members to meet with their representatives about the influence of early child education on kindergarten readiness, ways to lower expenses while maintaining quality and the hunt for sustainable government funding. A Statehouse day is also scheduled for February 5.
“We cannot give up the work we have done in 25 years,” Osman said.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)In St. Paul, hard work should be rewarded with good pay. 
But too often, in Minnesota’s own capital city, ordinances that are supposed to protect workers cannot be enforced, because the city lacks the power to use civil penalties. 
My organization, the Saint Paul Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, brings together over 100 local unions and nearly 16,000 union members who live in the city. The members of the unions I work for know the importance of having the right tools to enforce the rules, and conversely the precarity of not having a way to hold bad actors responsible for their actions. 
City Question #1 on voters’ ballot this year would mean St. Paul joins most other major Minnesota cities to have the ability to use administrative citations to enforce their rules, instead of just criminal convictions. 
We were proud our city passed an earned safe and sick time ordinance long before the state of Minnesota and passed a $15 minimum wage ordinance that is higher than state law. We recently added a new wage theft ordinance so city staff can protect the paychecks of every worker. 
But ordinances are only as good as their enforcement. I sit on the city’s Labor Standards Advisory Council and too often I hear from staff that they cannot fully enforce our city ordinances.
St. Paul — alone among the 25 largest cities in Minnesota — does not have the power to use administrative fines under civil law. Instead our ordinances, including those to protect workers, must be enforced with criminal penalties.
Too often city staff have to settle cases for less than a worker has earned because companies with deep pockets know that the criminal courts are fully occupied. Criminal judges should not have to have their calendars cluttered up with cases involving wage disputes and unpainted garages.
City staff could resolve cases faster through a civil law process instead of a criminal law process. When a low-wage worker gets shorted on their pay, every week they don’t get paid is a big deal. One short paycheck can snowball as unpaid bills lead to fines and late fees. Too often, bad employers use this dynamic to force settlements that leave a worker short.
While the criminal penalties-only approach can help big corporations skirt the law, even worse is that current law can cost workers their job. Without civil penalties, violations of city ordinances can result in criminal convictions that cost people a good job. For example, a St. Paul resident failed to paint his garage. Instead of getting a small civil fine, he wound up with a criminal conviction. He had a good job as a transit driver, but when they discovered his criminal record he lost the job. In other cases, people almost lost their housing because of criminal records related to incidents where dogs got loose. A criminal record can cost someone their job or housing, so we need a civil law alternative that keeps people out of criminal court.
Getting to this point has showcased the near unanimity of support for this tool. It wasn’t just union members who thought this was an important tool, but also the the City Council who approved it by a unanimous 7-0 vote. Both leading candidates for Mayor, Melvin Carter and Kaohly Her, have spoken in favor of it. 
Our national democracy is under threat. Our state is facing a divided government. Our city may be our last line of defense. Now more than ever we need St. Paul to be on the side of workers. 
I hope voters will take time to learn about this process and understand how administrative citations would improve St. Paul governance and make life better for our residents.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8809-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 07:17:00.430137

It took him 75 days just to get a court-ordered evaluation from the Department of Mental Health, according to Sarah Boyd, spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office.
He hasn’t been convicted of a crime. He was found incompetent to stand trial and has been in limbo ever since – stuck in jail until a bed becomes available in a state psychiatric hospital or services from the mental health department or the jail enable him to satisfy a judge that he can stand trial.
“We want folks to be restored to competency, so that they don’t have their constitutional rights violated,” Boyd said, referring to the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. “We want that to happen, and we wanted it to happen here, but that hasn’t really been the case.” 
In September, an average of 487 Missourians were waiting for a bed in a psychiatric hospital run by the department. The waitlist has grown by a third since September 2024 and almost 88% since September 2023. 
In August, that average number reached 492, an all-time high.

These numbers include people who are receiving services – including medication, therapy and competency education — in jails or out on bond, according to the department.
Lawmakers in 2023 authorized the department to provide jail-based competency, and programs have been established in St. Louis city and county, along with Jackson and Clay counties. The law also allows outpatient treatment for individuals who can be safely released on bond. 
The department has also expanded two mobile teams of clinicians who provide medication and case management to people on the waitlist through in-person jail visits and telehealth.
A year after the launch of the first jail-based competency programs, sheriffs, corrections medical staff and jail administrators say that although the new initiatives have helped address mental health needs, they aren’t enough to tackle the waitlist — or address the underlying need for mental health and substance use treatment that keeps some people cycling in and out of jail.
Only 12 people have so far attained competency after completing a jail-based pilot program, according to the department, and 52 people have participated.
Dr. Jeanette Simmons, deputy director of the state mental health department, said the growing waitlist isn’t a surprise.
“Our numbers have increased,” Simmons said. “We predicted that they would increase.”
Simmons attributed the increase to a static number of hospital beds and increasing numbers of competency evaluation requests from courts.
“As that number continues to increase, I’m not surprised that the number of folks found incompetent increases,” Simmons said. “It clearly correlates together.”
Simmons said the department has dialed up efforts to help people take first steps toward competency while they are waiting in jail, and that the mobile teams in particular have seen successes. Last year, 117 people attained competency through the teams’ work, according to the department. 
“Just by virtue of getting people started on their medications and stabilizing their psychiatric condition, they have restored to competence,” Simmons said.
Boyd, the spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, said Sheriff Will Akin was initially “frustrated” with the pilot program because it wasn’t clear to him at first that his jail would be expected to take patients from Platte, Buchanan and Andrew counties. 
Boyd said the program has been successful for those who participated in it and that Akin and the department have agreed on a plan to work together.
“We definitely want to continue with the program here,” Boyd said, “and we’re moving forward in a way that he thinks will make it successful.”
The idea of county jails housing mental health patients from other counties has been a deterrent for some to participate. Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott told The Independent in January that was the reason he opted out of the pilot program.
“I’m not going to participate in a warehousing contract of people that are mentally ill that shouldn’t be in jail in the first place,” Arnott said in January.
There are currently six people participating in the Clay County program, Boyd said on Monday. Four were transferred from counties in the Kansas City metro area and northwestern Missouri. Seven people are waiting for a spot in the pilot program or a hospital.
Boyd said that although the department pays the sheriff’s office $900 a day to cover program costs, the jail has sometimes had to send general population inmates to other detention centers to keep a pod available for competency restoration, at a daily cost of $65-$100 per inmate.
Dr. Paula Oldeg, director of corrections medicine in St. Louis County, said that while jail-based services will not eliminate the waitlist, participants in the county’s pilot program have received a higher level of care than is usually available in the jail.
“A jail is not the best place to really treat any condition,” Oldeg said. “A jail is not designed for that. That said, if we don’t treat it, my gosh, people can languish. They can decompensate. They can really suffer, not just mentally but physically.”
A man who waited months to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital died in a Kansas City jail in May. He started harming himself and lost touch with reality after being detained.
The St. Louis County pilot program, which accepted its first patients in January, has had 16 participants in all. Two have been deemed competent. One person was classified as permanently incompetent after multiple assessments. Two were released on bond or transferred. Two were dismissed for violent behavior. Two others opted out of the program.
Sheriffs in rural counties have had to rely on their own resources and community relationships to meet mental health needs in their jails.
Pemiscot County Sheriff Joe Bryant said his office contracts with a local company to provide services in his jail.
“They’ll come do that for us,” Bryant said, “which is great for us, because before that, there was really nothing.”
Perry County Sheriff Jason Klaus said there’s no room in his budget to hire a medical team, but he partners with a local provider to deliver substance use treatment in his 35-person jail at no charge to the sheriff’s office. 
Klaus said that while he appreciates the mobile teams’ work, the competency restoration process doesn’t necessarily meet behavioral health needs.
He said that when possible, he works with attorneys and judges to allow inmates to enroll in residential treatment programs on bond or medical furlough. He’s looking into doing this for people in his jail on the competency restoration waitlist.
“I want to hold people accountable,” Klaus said. “No mistake about that. However, I also believe that somebody sitting in jail for an indefinite amount of time, it’s not getting anyone any kind of justice.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091423_DeptMentalHealth3-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

Over 598,000 adults — about 10.6% of our state’s population — live with diabetes, and the numbers keep increasing.
Each year, more than 31,000 Missourians receive a new diagnosis, adding to the already heavy burden on our health care system. Diabetes impacts communities unevenly. Rural residents, low-income families and Black and Hispanic Missourians experience higher rates of the disease and encounter more barriers to consistent, effective care.
That’s why having access to tools that help people manage diabetes safely and effectively is so crucial.
In recent years, Missouri has made significant progress. MO HealthNet (our state’s Medicaid program) now covers continuous glucose monitors (or CGMs) for those who use insulin — without requiring prior authorization. In 2024, this coverage expanded to include individuals with gestational diabetes, again, without additional administrative barriers.
These are important steps forward for patients, families, and health care providers across the state.
But we can do even better. The next step is ensuring that people with diabetes have their choice of CGM.
Currently, MO HealthNet limits coverage to a single “preferred” CGM brand. Patients who might benefit from a different model can only access it if their doctor verifies it is medically necessary — even after they have already submitted a prescription for the device. This causes delays and unnecessary administrative work for both the person with diabetes and the health care provider.
This restriction may seem minor, but for someone who relies on a CGM every hour of every day to help them manage their diet and activity levels, it’s important.
The Standards of Care in Diabetes of the American Diabetes Association is clear: the choice of CGM should be based on individual circumstances, preferences, and needs. This isn’t just a matter of convenience. It’s about achieving better outcomes. Studies show that when patients can select devices that suit them best, they’re more likely to wear them consistently and maintain healthier glucose levels.
By providing access to more than one device, which allows patients and their health care providers to select from all types of CGMs, Missouri would align with ADA recommendations, enhance patient choice and improve long-term health outcomes.
The American Diabetes Association urges MO HealthNet to take the final step and provide open access to all CGM brands. Doing so would reaffirm Missouri’s commitment to patient-centered care.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/insulin-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

Interior of a modern data center. (Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)The efforts of some of the largest companies in the world, including Microsoft, Meta, Oracle and OpenAI, to develop data centers in communities across Wisconsin have sparked heated local debates among residents, government officials and even comedians. 
Those debates have often been over the data centers’ use of water and electricity, the net impact of local government deals with big corporations, the value of handing over large tracts of land for big warehouse-like buildings and the secrecy in which the plans are often shrouded. 
Data centers, buildings that house computer servers to store information for cloud-based software and, increasingly, to support the expansion of artificial intelligence, are becoming more and more prevalent in the Upper Midwest, according to the Minneapolis branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
While Wisconsin still lags behind its neighbors, the state is now home to 47 data centers with more on the horizon. As communities across the state weigh the merits of accepting data center development, critics and proponents say the state needs more than the current, piecemeal local approach. 
In Port Washington, a Milwaukee suburb on the shore of Lake Michigan, the local government has supported a proposal from tech giants Open AI and Oracle to develop an AI-focused data center on 2,000 acres of farmland in the community. That project is moving forward despite local backlash. 
In Mount Pleasant, a village in Racine County where state and local officials have been trying to salvage a failed Foxconn development, Microsoft has spent billions of dollars for the construction of two data centers in the community. 
But in nearby Caledonia, Microsoft was forced to back off a planned development after backlash from local residents led to the denial of a requested zoning change. 
Overwhelmingly, the largest complaints about data centers are the electricity and water usage. A recent Bloomberg News report found that the construction of data centers has caused electric bills in nearby communities to surge because of the high energy needs of the centers. A recent report from Clean Wisconsin found that just the data centers in Mount Pleasant and Port Washington will use enough electricity to power 4.3 million homes. 
Many data centers need to use water to cycle through their cooling systems, which are necessary because computer equipment can’t be allowed to overheat. While proponents of data centers have downplayed the amount of water required to run the cooling systems, critics point to the water use associated with the increase in electricity demand. Wisconsin’s existing power plants use a high amount of water.
These demands on water have become especially fraught as the data centers have become increasingly concentrated in southeast Wisconsin, where residents are very protective of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes watershed. 
Melissa Scanlan, the director of UW-Milwaukee’s Center for Water Policy, says Wisconsin’s failure to address data centers comprehensively could quickly put an overly burdensome strain on the state’s utilities.
“There should be a state level review of all of the potential proposals, so that the state can assess the impact on electricity generation and water supply,” Scanlan says. “Doing it in a piecemeal way, where you’ve got local governments deciding about hosting, but then utilities that are committed to supplying the electricity and water, is going to very quickly bump up against the realities of our ability to generate electricity in a responsible way.”
Robin Palm, a certified urban planner who lives in Milwaukee, says he’s largely supportive of data centers because they provide local governments with a consistent source of property tax revenue without requiring many city services. 
“A data center is extremely low services, they’re not going to have kids that need to go to school,” he says. “They are not going to have homeowners that are going to make demands at the village board, and they’re not going to have police calls because of crime or anything like that. So it’s a really low services, high value land use.”
He says the current approach of leaving these decisions up to local officials and zoning boards has pointed the public’s skepticism in the wrong direction. The local officials, he says, are making an easy economic development calculation when the real blame for the confusion should go to the state Public Service Commission and power companies — which have failed to support the expansion of renewable energy in the state. 
Palm points to Iowa, which has far more data centers than Wisconsin and gets more than 60% of its power supply from wind. 
“[Iowa is] getting cheap electricity. They use a lot more per capita than a lot of other states, and they’re way far ahead of us in data centers, and it’s mostly renewable,” he says. “I can’t see anything to complain about that situation. So it seems to me that the obvious culprit, I think, on our side, is the PSC and We Energies. There is something in that mechanism that’s basically screwing us.” 
Warning about a ‘data center stampede’
Late last month, state Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said that a “data center stampede” has started in Wisconsin and that state officials need to develop some sort of statewide plan for how to manage it. 
“We must develop a statewide plan for data centers that prioritizes the needs of our neighbors and its impact on the environment and our communities before the profit margins of private utilities and big tech companies,” he said in a statement. “If we don’t, the data center stampede will likely continue unabated, and in its wake may very well be a Wisconsin we no longer recognize — one that has abandoned its tradition of protecting our air, water, and land for future generations.”
Richard Heinemann, an attorney for Madison-based law firm Boardman Clark, says state lawmakers have already made a policy statement affirming their desire for the construction of data centers. In the 2023-25 state budget, passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, a provision was included to give a sales tax rebate on the “development, construction, renovation, expansion, replacement, repair, or operation” of data centers. 
Heinemann also points to two bills signed into law by Evers earlier this year to advance the development of nuclear energy in the state. That legislation was introduced specifically to respond to the increased energy demands of data centers.
“Wisconsin must be prepared to meet soaring energy demands that will be driven by the development of data centers and other energy-intensive economic development,” the co-sponsorship memo states. 
But Heinemann says he believes local officials and residents already have the necessary tools to weigh in on data center development. 
“We already have procedural mechanisms in place to try to address some of these issues,” says Heinemann, who recently wrote an article about local government’s authority to intervene in Public Service Commission considerations of utility expansion. “I’m not saying every issue, but some of the important ones that people have looked at or pointed to. So I don’t know what sort of new legislation one could propose that would address these issues in some more comprehensive way, or in a way that would just provide some due process.” 
Hovering over the whole debate is the secrecy with which big tech companies have operated while working to build data centers. The corporations responsible for development are often hidden behind obscure LLCs and have a record across the country of trying to get local governments to sign non-disclosure agreements (though it’s unlikely such an agreement could stand up to Wisconsin’s open records laws). A group of environmental organizations recently had to file a lawsuit to force the city of Racine to disclose how much water it was estimating it would be providing to the Microsoft site in Mount Pleasant. 
Heinemann says these debates would go more smoothly if the companies worked in the open with communities. 
“Data centers themselves have an obligation to make sure that they’re doing the outreach necessary when they work to site a facility in a locality,” he says. “It behooves them to do that work of trying to address the needs of the locality.” 
Heinemann says says the state Public Service Commission, Department of Natural Resources and local communities through their zoning authority already have the resources they need to regulate data centers
“Each project is complicated. It does require a lot of infrastructure,” Heinemann adds. “There are a lot of potential benefits to communities, but there are also impacts on the communities, those can be addressed, and there are legal procedures and agencies whose job it is to do that.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Four more Republican state senators have announced their support for drawing new congressional boundaries early in Indiana.
Both Politico and the Indianapolis Business Journal have reported, citing anonymous sources, that Braun is expected to call a special session as early as Monday.
On Friday, Sens. Scott Alexander, R-Muncie; Ron Alting, R-Lafayette; Justin Busch, R-Fort Wayne; and Daryl Schmitt, R-Jasper, posted statements in support of mid-cycle redistricting sought by President Donald Trump.
That brings the number of “yes” votes to 11, according to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s tally of public statements, with five GOP senators on record as being against. The remaining 24 are undecided or haven’t made their intentions public. Legislation needs 26 votes to pass the Senate.
The new burst of public support comes after Senate GOP caucus leadership announced last week that it didn’t have the votes.
“In light of recent events, including the federal government shutdown, and after much thought and consideration, I have decided I will be supporting efforts to redistrict Indiana’s congressional districts,” Alexander said.
“President Trump and our conservative majorities are delivering real results to improve the lives of Hoosiers and strengthen our country,” he continued. “We cannot sit on the sidelines while the Democrats continue to gerrymander and deny Americans fair representation in Washington D.C. The time to take action is now.”
Alting is one of the more moderate Republicans in the caucus. He’d been quiet on redistricting until Friday.
“The ongoing federal government shutdown has convinced me I must support efforts to redraw Indiana’s congressional maps,” Alting said. “I’ve worked alongside many of our current Indiana delegation in the State Legislature before they were elected to Congress. Given the current situation in Washington, D.C., I feel an obligation to help ensure my former colleagues are working with a strong Republican majority in the US House of Representatives.”
The House Republican caucus is believed to have the votes.
Indiana’s congressional seats are split 7-2 in favor of the GOP. National Republicans want to eliminate both Democratic seats — in Indianapolis and northwest Indiana — to help ensure Trump maintains control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities saw enrollment increase by 3.6% this fall semester, which officials attributed in part to a rise in first-time students.
The 6,100 student increase marked the fifth consecutive year of growth and represented Oklahoma’s highest fall semester headcount in eight years. Over 175,100 students enrolled in a public institution of higher education, officials said.
The greatest growth was at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, which saw a 4.7% increase in enrollment, according to the analysis. Community college enrollment grew by 4.3% growth. The state’s regional schools saw the slowest growth at 1.2%. 
Oklahoma colleges and universities also saw 4.1% increase in the number of students enrolling after graduating high school. 
“While campuses across the nation are enrolling fewer first-year students, freshman enrollment at Oklahoma public colleges and universities is increasing,” Chancellor Sean Burrage said in a statement. “This positive trend reflects our state system of higher education’s ongoing commitment to affordability and student success.”
Concurrent enrollment also grew with an additional 1,400 students taking classes from an Oklahoma college or university while still in high school. 
Post-grad employment outcomes
A different analysis found that over 91% of graduates from Oklahoma higher education institutions are still employed in the state a year after graduation, but that number dropped 83% after five years. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education track where graduates work to help measure graduates’ impact on the state workforce and to gauge whether degrees earned in the state are put to use. 
About 51% of non-residents were employed in the state one year after graduating. After five years, that number fell to 37.7%. 
Engineers who earned a bachelor’s degree in Oklahoma were employed one year after graduation at a rate of 72%, but this fell to 56% after five years. 
“Our engineers leave the state at higher rates than some of our other critical occupations,” said Cass Minx, the associate vice chancellor for workforce and economic development. “So this one in particular, I think really is one that we should focus on and need some of the most support to incentivize them to stay in the state.”
Nursing and teaching, however, had greater retention rates. 
Nurses with an associate’s, bachelor’s or master’s degree were working in Oklahoma one year after graduation at rates all exceeding 91%. After five years, these rates remain above 82%. 
“We still have a shortage of nurses, so we know that we still need to put forward through the pipeline,” Minx said. “But we definitely know that there are jobs waiting for nurses immediately upon graduation and that they are still working here in the state five years after graduation.”
More than 87% of teachers with a bachelor’s degree stayed in Oklahoma and 78% were still working in Oklahoma after five years. 
The same report found that as education level and work experience increases, so does pay. 
The median annual income for a graduate with a bachelor’s degree after one year was $47,169. After five years, it rose to $58,751. 
“We see that return on investment through salaries over the last several years,” she said. “Those with high school diplomas, their immediate annual wages have stayed rather stagnant, while those with a college degree and above typically increase.”
While the State Regents don’t track the wages of high school diploma recipients, this refers to findings from the U.S. Census Bureau, a spokesperson said. 
Between 2004 and 2024, earnings of those with a high school degree but no college rose 3.2%, while earnings of those with a bachelor’s degree or more went up 6.3%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Graduates who were recipients of the Oklahoma’s Promise scholarship also had high employment rates in the state. One year after graduation, nearly 92% of these students were employed in Oklahoma while five years later almost 82% were still working in the state.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)I’m counting my blessings that we have a state board who is refusing to kowtow to pressure from the Oklahoma legislative elite to boost lawmaker pay. 
Because judging from the pushback the Legislative Compensation Board received after refusing to give our lawmakers a pay raise, it’s obvious that some of our elected leaders have such an inflated ego that they believe they should earn far more than the average Oklahoman does while working far fewer hours.
The average hourly pay in the Oklahoma City area in 2024 was $27.95 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $58,000 a year, according to a July report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Yet, we pay our legislators on average $60,828 a year to work four months. That includes their base $47,500 salary and an extra $196 in per diem to help cover the daily expenses of legislators who live over 50 miles away from the Capitol.
That total compensation jumps to $72,869 when retirement and benefits are factored in, according to the Oklahoma Management and Enterprise Services. 
How nice it must be to be paid that much for what is designed to be a part-time job.
If you spend enough time at the Oklahoma Capitol, it’s hard to miss the fact that during the annual legislative session, our lawmakers generally only work Monday through Thursday, preferring to head home to their districts on Fridays. It’s also not usual for them to make Mondays half-days, often starting their official duties well after the noon hour. There are also plenty of days where the majority of them do pretty much nothing much consequential at all, particularly when budget negotiations are going on behind closed doors. And some of them play hookey, traveling out of state for various reasons during the session. 
And lest we forget, many of these lawmakers are perfectly happy to save a few bucks by being wined and dined — on someone else’s dime — by lobbyists hoping to woo their vote. Lobbyists reported spending over $220,000 on drinks and food for legislators during the most recent session.
Despite that, we pay them the second highest salary of our neighboring states, according to an analysis by Oklahoma Management and Enterprise Services. Only Colorado, which awards a $47,561 salary, pays more. Lawmakers there also voted recently to increase their legislators per diem.
Luckily Oklahomans have a constitutionally created board that sets our legislators’ pay. Voters realized that if left to their own devices, lawmakers would pay themselves a king’s ransom due to an inflated sense of worth.
This board meets in odd numbered years on the third Tuesday of October to set legislative pay for the lawmakers who will be elected the following November. Meeting ahead of a general election gives potential candidates clarity about what they should expect to make if they decide to run.
Five of the members of the board are appointed by the governor, two by the state House and two by the state Senate.
The Board publicly voted last week to keep legislative salaries flat for another year — a prudent decision given the fact that Oklahomans are struggling to make ends meet as they battle soaring grocery prices, a federal government shutdown that is expected to affect access to food, and some of the highest insurance rates in the nation. Lawmakers also just imprudently cut income taxes, which will eventually reduce the amount of revenue they have to spend on programs that make our schools better and our roads less pothole-ridden.
But apparently those economic realities are not a concern for Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who leads his chamber’s Republican caucus. Paxton criticized the board’s decision to hold their salaries flat. The Senate president pro tem, by the way, will receive a 26% increase in his stipend next November. The board did vote to increase that from $18,829 to $23,750. That potentially brings the Senate president’s pay up to a whopping $84,578.
Still a tone deaf Paxton urged the board to revisit legislative pay, arguing that their job takes them away from families and “other career obligations outside of the Capitol.”
Supporters of higher pay argue that legislative service is a full-time job because they’re busy out of session meeting with constituents and doing other legislative work.
Let’s not forget that our lawmakers made the choice to do this. Nobody is forcing them to serve. If they believe they’re not being compensated fairly, they can leave. There’s always plenty of people willing to serve in their stead.
But I bet you dollars to donuts that most don’t want to do that because they are eying their next cushy roles.
Let’s take former Republican state Sen. James Leewright, R-Bristow, who in 2022 decided not to seek another term and “return to the private sector.” 
Leewright almost immediately became president and CEO of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association. He leads the group’s “public policy, advocacy and regulatory efforts,” according to the group’s website. He also serves as CEO of the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association and the Oklahoma Travel Industry Association.
In addition, Leewright serves as a House appointee on this compensation board and has demanded that this board reconsider their votes on Nov. 4. He touted the common — and insulting — legislative talking point that people don’t understand what they’re doing.
Frankly, I’d like to know how someone who advocates for public policy on behalf of multiple industries ended up on a board setting legislative pay. It sure seems like a conflict of interest.
But if lawmakers genuinely feel like they’re being short-changed, maybe they should spend some time in New Mexico, whose taxpayers don’t provide their lawmakers with any annual salary. 
Maybe it will make our legislators appreciate what Oklahoma taxpayers invest in them and remind them who they truly serve.

It's the right move to right-size the tax and royalty burden on the coal industry, write industry representatives Rob Creager and Travis Deti.
The post Wyoming coal is ready to meet increasing demand for reliable, affordable energy appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration recently announced a broad plan to strengthen America’s coal industry. The Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency outlined new funding, expanded leasing and regulatory relief to extend the life of coal plants to meet rapidly increasing electricity demand and ensure reliable, affordable and dispatchable electricity.

Opinion

For Wyoming, the top coal producer in the nation, these actions matter. Coupled with the July decision to reduce the royalty rate for coal on federal lands to 7% and the state’s reduction of the severance tax on surface coal, Wyoming’s coal and mining industry is in a prime position to thrive after years of being tied to burdensome regulations and executive orders. Importantly, the tax and royalty burden on the industry has been “right-sized” to meet today’s competitive market conditions.
Wyoming coal has been the backbone of America’s power supply for decades, but it has also been carrying a heavier financial load than other fuels. Royalty rates directly affect whether Wyoming coal is competitive in the national marketplace. When the cost of production on coal is pushed higher than on competing fuels — in part due to its diverse tax structure — markets move away from coal regardless of reliability or demand. 
The Department of the Interior is leveling the playing field for the coal fuel supply by adjusting the royalty rate downward. To have a competitive coal fuel supply, taxes and royalties must be equalized. Wyoming coal has been carrying a heavier burden, and this change ensures that when utilities and consumers make decisions, they are comparing fuels on merit, not distorted by unequal tax structures.  
The stakes are not just economic. Royalty reform means Wyoming coal can remain affordable to the utilities and states that depend on it, preserving thousands of jobs and millions in revenue for schools, roads and local services. It also means stability for our rural communities that depend on coal payrolls and the spin-off economy. For too long, royalty rates have been discussed as a simple line item. In truth, they are a determining factor in whether our coal mines stay open, our plants continue to run for the long term and Wyoming coal remains a cornerstone of America’s energy supply.
The new leasing announcement is equally essential. Opening 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal production ensures that supply will be available long term. It is triple the benchmark set under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and clearly recognizes that coal is not a resource of the past but a resource for America’s increasing present and future energy demands.
These federal actions come at a critical time. Electricity demand across the United States is rising rapidly, driven by general consumer increases, data centers, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing. Meeting this demand requires every reliable source of power, and coal is the backbone of that reliability. At a time when national security and energy independence are at the forefront, coal ensures our nation can generate power without depending on unstable global markets.
Along with the royalty rate reduction and leasing announcement, the Department of Energy committed $625 million in investments to extend plant life and improve reliability. These measures give coal plants the time and flexibility to continue operations while innovation and advanced technologies progress.
There are short-term pains in adjusting to and weathering the debates around coal’s future. But the long-term gains are far greater. Royalty relief, fair taxes and federal support give Wyoming coal a fair shot to compete and to continue delivering what America needs: affordable, reliable, dispatchable energy and secure jobs for Wyoming families.
Leadership at the federal and state levels has brought significant, welcomed changes to an industry that has struggled to keep up with the pendulum swings of new federal administrations over the recent decade. 
Trump’s policies are about ensuring Wyoming coal remains a vital part of America’s energy future. They will strengthen our communities, secure and create good-paying jobs, and give confidence that Wyoming coal will be there to do the job and power the nation. 
The Wyoming Energy Authority and the Wyoming Mining Association are proud to support these changes and initiatives together. We have long worked with Gov. Mark Gordon, Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, Rep. Harriett Hageman, the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources and many across the state to ensure coal remains part of the national conversation. Recent announcements show that effort is making a difference.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The potential impeachment of University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor appears more likely after a legislative committee hosted a briefing on what the process would look like and committee leadership echoed calls for her resignation.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who has said she would pursue impeachment, has proposed a timeline to do so and made available a video of a car crash authorities accuse O’Connor of causing while allegedly drunk in May. Kauth said she received the video from the injured family involved.

The Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, which would likely handle articles of impeachment against O’Connor, hosted a 30-minute briefing Friday. Kauth told the committee she would introduce a resolution to begin the impeachment process on day one of the 2026 session, Jan. 7, which would require a public hearing after. That’s if O’Connor does not resign.
Voters in central and western Douglas County elected O’Connor to a second six-year term in November. She is a former University of Nebraska at Omaha student regent.
O’Connor declined to comment. Her attorney could not be reached for comment.
Pressure ramps up
Prosecutors accuse O’Connor of driving drunk around 8:30 p.m. May 21, when she allegedly crashed into an oncoming car with five passengers in it, including three children under the age of 7. The front passenger, the children’s grandmother, sustained a broken back and pelvis.
Police collected a blood sample from O’Connor almost three hours after the crash. It came back at 0.321%, four times the legal limit, police allege in court documents. 
A video of the alleged crash, captured by a home security system of a resident of the street where the crash occurred, shows an eastbound green Subaru Outback crossing into the wrong side of the road in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood before colliding with a westbound white Ford Focus. Both cars were totaled.

Kauth had already called for O’Connor’s resignation and suggested impeachment. Now, the chair and vice chair of the Government Committee say O’Connor should resign.
“I’m hoping there won’t be a need for the process,” said State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, committee chair.
“If she’s not willing to do the right thing by resigning her position, then we need to help her to do so,” said State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, committee vice chair.

Ricoh Mountain, the father of the children who sustained minor injuries in the crash, has pressed publicly for O’Connor’s resignation, including at the latest NU Board of Regents meeting this month.
Kauth set a deadline of mid-session 2026 for O’Connor and said she will file articles of impeachment then if O’Connor hasn’t resigned. It takes 25 votes in the 49-member Legislature to impeach.
‘How we need to proceed’
Kauth said she sought Friday’s briefing because the last impeachment vote came in 2006, nearly two decades ago. It would be just the third impeachment vote of the last century. A former NU regent was impeached and removed from office in 2006, and the state’s attorney general was impeached and removed from office in 1984.
Seven of the eight Government Committee members attended the briefing. State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who attended a committee hearing earlier Friday, left for planned travel.

The briefing was originally meant to be closed-door, which Kauth said was done with O’Connor in mind. The committee voted 3-3 to do so, with another “present, not voting.” Conservatives sought to close the meeting at Kauth’s request, and liberals voted to make it open. One Republican, State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, took no position. 
Andersen said after the briefing that his focus is accountability. He said that when someone is in a position of authority, they can’t “pick and choose” when to make sound judgment.
“When somebody demonstrates in such a blatant way that they have complete disregard for the rules and the rules of law and the safety of people in the general public, it shows that they can’t remain in a position of authority,” Andersen said.
Sanders said the briefing helped put her committee members “at ease” and helped them know that there is a process in place and any questions they might have can be answered. Only a few clarifying questions were asked and just one to Kauth confirming that impeachment would need to be juggled around any other legislative matters in a 60-day session.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings said of the briefing: “It’s good to know how we need to proceed.”
Committee partisan split
Kauth said she anticipates impeachment would be bipartisan, arguing it’s about the public perception of state officials generally, not just one person. The officially nonpartisan Legislature has 33 Republicans, 15 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive. The Government Committee is split 5-3 ideologically, majority Republican. O’Connor is a registered Democrat; Kauth is a Republican.
“It should only matter that this is an incident that happened,” Kauth said.

Omaha State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Dunixi Guereca and Megan Hunt, the minority on the committee, declined to comment after the briefing. Hunt, the registered nonpartisan, represents O’Connor and the injured family members in central Douglas County. 
Wordekemper also declined to comment. He could be the deciding committee vote on advancing impeachment.
Even without impeachment, the Nebraska Constitution prohibits felons from holding office, and O’Connor faces one felony charge of driving drunk and causing serious injury to another person, filed in July. Short of a felony conviction, the Legislature is the only path to removing a statewide official from office.
Omaha City Prosecutor Kevin Slimp is taking the lead on the case from the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, which normally handles felony prosecutions, because O’Connor, until early August, had served as a deputy county attorney for civil matters. O’Connor resigned from that post but has not publicly addressed her elected position.
Public trust ‘finite resource’
Kauth said that’s particularly troubling as regents oversee a nearly $3.6 billion operating budget, $700 million of which is from state tax revenue, and determine the general government of the university system. Regents also hire top campus administrators, generally oversee campuses, set short- and long-term goals and establish and enforce standards of conduct.

Pointing to NU policies, Kauth noted the regents can discipline any employee or student whose use of alcohol or drugs off campus adversely affects their work or academic performance or impairs the safety of themself or others. That action is independent of any outside criminal, civil or administrative penalties.
“A more honest, self-reflected individual would look at this situation and recognize the egregiousness of her actions and choose to resign,” Kauth told the committee.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican who served as an NU regent between 2013 and 2023, including four years with O’Connor, has previously said that while O’Connor is innocent until proven guilty, “If she knows the allegations against her to be true, I urge her to reflect on whether she should remain in a position of public trust.”
If impeached, a state official is suspended from service as the case moves to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which conducts the impeachment trial. In other states, the impeachment trial would normally go to a second legislative chamber, which Nebraska doesn’t have. Two state senators would argue the case.

It takes five of the seven justices to convict on “clear and convincing” evidence. Justices could decide to bar an impeached official from holding future office. 
Kauth said she feels lawmakers could clear that bar.
Dick Clark, legal counsel for the government Committee, said at the briefing that an impeachment trial “jumps the line” and would become the top priority for the Supreme Court. Impeachment in Nebraska generally concerns “any misdemeanor in office,” Clark said, or any “malfeasance” as determined by the Legislature and evaluated by the Supreme Court.
Andersen said resigning would be the right thing “on everybody’s account,” and Kauth said no state senator wants to pursue impeachment but that it’s the Legislature’s responsibility if needed.
“We have to hold ourselves to high standards,” Kauth said. “Public trust is a finite resource, and if we continue to erode it, we fall apart.”

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)As the federal government shutdown continues, Idaho’s ability to continue funding for a public assistance program for pregnant moms, new mothers and parents of young children is unclear. 
Tariff revenue is funding Idaho’s Women Infants and Children, or WIC, program through October, and maybe even into November, said Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter. But the state health agency isn’t sure how it would keep funding WIC if the government shutdown lasts until November.
“We don’t have formal guidance about that at this time,” he said in emailed statements. 
If the shutdown stretches into November, which is less than a week away, WIC could run out of funds, USA Today reported. 
Idaho and many other states last week said they would soon stop giving out food assistance benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The government shutdown is prompting the pauses. 
The public assistance programs serve low-income earners. Nearly 32,000 Idahoans are on WIC, and almost 133,000 Idahoans are on SNAP, state figures show.

Public health districts in southern Idaho said last week that WIC is still open.
A spokesperson for Central District Health, which serves Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties, said district officials “are closely monitoring the situation and will keep participants updated if anything changes.”

“While federal funding is a bit uncertain without a resolution to end the government shutdown, (Central District Health) plans to continue to remain open to serve our WIC clients,” spokesperson Stephanie Borders said in an emailed statement. “We will use unspent funds from last year’s grant and carryover funds (Central District Health) has from last year’s fiscal budget to pay staff salaries.”
Southwest District Health, which serves Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties, has “been communicating to families to continue to attend their appointments and use their benefits as usual,” spokesperson Monique Evancic said in an emailed statement.

The Payette Land Trust and The Wilderness Land Trust announced this month that they partnered to purchase a 94-acre private land inholding within the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness last year. 
In the days before the federal government shutdown began Oct. 1, the land trusts were able to transfer the land to public ownership and officially add it to the designated wilderness area, The Wilderness Land Trust Director of Marketing and Communications Margosia Jadkowski said. 
That means that the Annie Creek property, which includes wetlands, gentle slopes and creeks, is in public hands and permanently protected from development.
 Property would have been vulnerable to development without conservation efforts of the land trusts

The property is located near the western edge of the Frank Church wilderness, about 40 miles from McCall. 
Officials said the property is located near a developed road and would have been vulnerable to development if it wasn’t purchased by the land trusts and added to the wilderness area.
The Leuthold Foundation also contributed support to help purchase the property, officials said. 
“Idaho is changing at a rapid rate which requires voluntary partnerships between private landowners, organizations and foundations to conserve Idaho’s natural beauty,” Payette Land Trust Executive Director Craig Utter said in a written statement. “We are proud to work with The Wilderness Land Trust and the Leuthold Foundation to conserve this unique landscape into the future.”
One of the crown jewels of public land in Idaho, the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness is the largest contiguous wilderness area in the Lower 48 and includes approximately 2.3 million acres. 
The Frank Church wilderness was originally created by Congress in 1980. The Salmon River flows through the wilderness, which is habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife, including deer, black bears, wolves, coyotes, lynx, elk, mountain lions, beavers, salmon and endangered wolverines. 
The Frank Church wilderness also served as one of the original sites of wolf reintroduction in 1995.
“Thanks to our partnerships with the Payette Land Trust and the Leuthold Foundation, this special place will be protected for future generations to enjoy in one of America’s most iconic wilderness areas,” said The Wilderness Land Trust President Brad Borst in a written statement. 
 Wilderness designation is the highest form of protection for public lands in the U.S.

Private land inholdings located within a wilderness area – many of which would have been privately owned and grandfathered in before the wilderness designations were created – were not subject to the same protections as the wilderness area, officials said. 
A wilderness designation is the highest form of protection available for public lands and can only be changed by an act of Congress. A wilderness designation protects land from development and motorized use, seeking to preserve the natural, primitive state of land. 
Over the past 33 years, The Wilderness Land Trust has worked to buy private land inholdings within wilderness areas and transfer the properties to public ownership to become part of the official wilderness areas. Since its founding, The Wilderness Land Trust has purchased 614 such properties and transferred them to be added to wilderness areas in the U.S., Jadkowski said. The Payette Land Trust owns or holds conservation easements on 21 properties, totaling nearly 3,900 acres, officials said.

(Photo: Courtesy NC Black Alliance)It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Well, almost. Autumn leaves will fall first, rolling out a brownish-orange carpet for Thanksgiving and, before that, Halloween. Just how happy those holidays will be is the thing.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) should have some insight during a Nov. 6 media call announcing its retail sales forecast for the 2025 winter holiday season. Next to back-to-college shopping, the winter holidays are when we spend the most money, according to the NRF.
We, the people, had the holiday spirit in early NRF forecasting. During the last winter holiday season, the average U.S. consumer spent $874.67. That’s expected to increase to $901.99 this year. Which is surprising after our elected officials in Congress shut down the federal government by failing to agree on a budget that would keep funds flowing to cover or offset costs for necessary stuff — like health insurance.
Here, listen to Karida Giddings, the access to health care program coordinator for North Carolina Black Alliance: “How do you decide between filling prescriptions or having food on the table, between going to the doctor or presents under the tree?”
Two of Giddings’ visionary initiatives positioned her to take North Carolina’s pulse this year: Rooted in Wellness Day, an annual statewide health and wellness outreach, and her OUR State of Health tour of rural communities.
“We’ve had the opportunity to hear directly from Black North Carolinians about what wellness really means when the cost of living keeps rising and health care affordability feels increasingly out of reach,” Giddings said. “Our communities are carrying the weight of policy decisions they didn’t make — decisions that will soon force them to choose between their health, their household and their holiday traditions.”
On Jan. 1 — really comprehend this, now — the health care premiums of 22 million Americans will double. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 4.2 million people won’t have health insurance because they’ll be priced out of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace on account of rich people who got tax breaks while those in the middle and working classes lost the subsidies that made their lifesaving colonoscopies affordable.
Republicans did that. If it’s too harsh to call them a bunch of Scrooges, then they’re at least elves working for a mean Santa who gave orders to stuff coal in our stockings.
“As premium tax credit enhancements expire and insurance premiums climb, many will wonder whether they can afford to stay insured at all,” Giddings said. “Medicaid expansion offered long-awaited relief, but that progress is now at risk of being undermined by policies that raise costs elsewhere.”
Earlier this year, on the Fourth of July, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law. One of the things it set in motion was some $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, with 10 million people projected to lose coverage, according to the CBO.
“I go to the doctor regularly. I’m with Medicaid,” Anson County resident Chavis McQueen said.“Four dollars when I go to a visit. My co-pay is not very high, so my health is pretty good right now.”
Right. For now.
“Medicaid is good,” McQueen said. “Medicare is more for, like, the older [people]. I’m not there yet. But if we get rid of Medicaid, I might not make it there.”
McQueen, 43, works with youth at the HOLLA! Center in Morven, a rural North Carolina town. He’s trying to get a baseball team going for the kids. That’s a good thing for obvious reasons, keeping young people off the streets and all of that. But if one of them breaks a leg sliding into third base, let’s hope the kid’s mama ain’t on Medicaid.
Politicians are accountable to the people, both those who did and didn’t vote for them.
McQueen’s eyeing North Carolina’s senators. “Hopefully, Thom Tillis and Ted — what’s his name? — Budd; hopefully, they’ll be able to do some things,” McQueen said. “That’s why we have to get out here and vote.”
If Tillis, Budd and others on their side of the aisle don’t do what they know is right by extending health care subsidies, then a whole lot of folks are looking at paying roughly $500 extra each month for the right to go see a doctor. That’s from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
It’s really unconscionable to know that’s why the government is shut down, all because individuals who are able to afford medical care are OK denying it to other human beings.
“This is the type of economic uncertainty many folks will face: families stretching dollars, skipping follow-up appointments or postponing lifesaving screenings,” Giddings said. “The question isn’t just how we’ll get through the holidays, it’s how we’ll continue to build power to ensure wellness isn’t seasonal, but sustained year-round.”
All of that while heading into the most wonderful time of the year.

Bill Lee cautioned SNAP recipients Friday to prepare for a lapse in their benefits starting Nov. 1 and blamed congressional Democrats for failing to end the government shutdown.
“The longer Democrats wait to reopen the government, the more delays customers can expect as the program restarts,” a Friday statement from the Governor’s Office said.
Some 690,000 Tennesseans who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could lose the benefit in November if the U.S. Senate fails to pass a resolution to continue spending federal funds. The federal government spends about $146 million a month putting money onto SNAP cards.
The Governor’s Office release said the program is federally funded and operated and Tennessee won’t be able to use state money to provide the benefit because it doesn’t have a mechanism to load benefits onto recipients’ cards.
Nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans could lose SNAP benefits come November if government shutdown continues

“Congress has a responsibility to fund the federal government, and while Democrats continue to hold federal dollars hostage, my administration is working with members of the faith community and nonprofit partners to ensure Tennessee families do not go hungry,” Lee said in the statement. “I share the frustration of hardworking Tennesseans who will be impacted by this temporary lapse, and sincerely hope Democrats will choose to put the American people ahead of politics and reopen the government now.”
The Governor’s Office sent the statement a day after Tennessee House Democrats urged him to call a special session to provide funding to fill in the gap and ensure people receive SNAP benefits and other federal services.
“While Washington, D.C. is broken and you may blame whoever you wish for the shutdown, we, as state leaders, have a duty to rise above the partisan politics and serve those we represent,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons wrote to the governor. 
U.S. Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the funding resolution, using their holdout as leverage against President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill and cuts to Medicaid and the end of some Affordable Care Act subsidies. The measure needs 60 votes to pass, and Republicans hold 53 seats, meaning they need seven votes out of 45 Democrats and two independents.










While Washington, D.C. is broken and you may blame whoever you wish for the shutdown, we, as state leaders, have a duty to rise above the partisan politics and serve those we represent.


– Rep. John Ray Clemmons, House Democratic Caucus 


Tennessee Department of Human Services Commissioner Clarence Carter backed up Lee’s assertion that no benefits will be added to recipients’ cards starting in November unless the federal government reopens. He promised that the state would be “ready to act quickly” when federal operations resume.
Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat, called on the governor to “spare us the political spin” and offer solutions to keep people from being hurt by the shutdown.
“Gov. Lee’s finger-pointing doesn’t change the facts — the Republican Speaker of the U.S. House hasn’t opened the chamber for legislative work since Sept. 19. That means for more than a month, House Republicans have been on vacation while Donald Trump’s shutdown hurts families, freezes paychecks, and stalls vital services for Tennesseans,” Campbell said.

Mike Crapo stands to the right of President Donald Trump as the president signs the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025. (Courtesy of White House Office of Legislative Affairs)Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo’s choice to revise the House version of the 2025 reconciliation bill (H.R.1) and expand the child tax credit to include two million previously excluded children was a good, fair-minded decision. 
Unfortunately, he joined Idaho’s congressional delegation in passing the largest cut to public health care funding in U.S. history. He was crucial to Senate negotiations that resulted in this bill; it is anything but beautiful. It punishes Idaho families, effectively excluding many from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, and cutting Medicaid for others. Seventy thousand or more Idahoans will be impacted directly, and many will become uninsured. These cuts will reverberate throughout Idaho’s health care system, impacting everyone. 
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

It’s not a minor inconvenience to be uninsured. I grew up before Medicaid or Medicare existed. It was the 1950s and 1960s, decades before the Affordable Care Act was imagined. As blue-collar workers, my parents’ jobs did not provide health insurance. Most people in my community were uninsured. I did not get health coverage until I was 30 years old. 
I remember my mother treating my leg wound at home because we couldn’t afford to pay the doctor that week. When more serious illnesses and injuries happened, my parents simply had to figure out how to make payments on medical bills. 
When I was 10, my mother got cancer. We received no financial assistance. The cost of her surgery and treatment plunged my parents into medical debt than haunted them throughout their working lives. It wasn’t until well after I left home in 1969 that my dad got health insurance through his job. 
As they aged and finally retired, they received Medicare. Their retirement income could never have supported their increasing health care costs as they aged. Medicare was a financial lifeline. That’s why Medicare was created. There was public recognition that few seniors could afford to pay health care costs out-of-pocket. Few insurance companies would even cover seniors. The 1950 census showed that only one in eight people over 60 had health insurance. Lives were jeopardized, and the quality of life for many seniors was abysmal. 
Similarly, Medicaid and the ACA were created because the public recognized that many working families, people with disabilities and others cannot pay health costs out-of-pocket without having those costs deplete all other family budget items – housing, food, utilities. 
The need still exists in the current era where health costs are many times larger as a portion of household costs than when my mother got cancer. The difference seems to be that there is a worldview loose in the world that demeans people with health needs and little ability to pay, accusing them of being fraudsters. 
The entire Idaho congressional delegation cites “waste, fraud and abuse” as the basis for these cuts of the health coverage for 70,000 Idaho families, particularly the cuts to Medicaid. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates there is little of it in the health care cuts they are making. Georgetown University Center for Children and Families simply states, “This narrative is simply false.” 
Instead of taking a scalpel to remove whatever problems might exist in our public health care system, the majority in the 2025 Congress took a scythe, and became the grim reaper, cutting coverage for many millions of people nationwide. New estimates of the net impact of these health care cuts in the 2025 tax bill (H.R.1) project that 7.5 million people nationwide will have no or drastically reduced health care coverage. They needed a second opinion before they decided to perform such radical surgery on an entire system. 
Idaho advocates estimate that because of this bill, 80 extra people will die unnecessarily every year because they’re uninsured. People without insurance or ability to pay can’t access health care. They don’t get the primary care and testing needed to identify and treat health conditions before they become emergency room visits. Emergency room visits are the most expensive access point in the health care system. Again, the treatment to address a questionable diagnosis will create a more costly approach to health care. 
Sen. Crapo used to champion health care. His flyers still tout his advocacy on various health issues. Sadly, with H.R. 1, Sen. Crapo has joined his Idaho colleagues in Congress in a blunder that will cost Idaho families: in dollars, in fear of not being able to pay for essential health services for their families, in their health, and even in lives. In fact, Sen. Crapo was a key advocate, taking the House bill and negotiating changes to get it through the Senate. He cannot claim ignorance. 
Actions and intentions matter. I do not know the intentions of Sen. Crapo and his Idaho-based congressional colleagues. But their actions are creating immense harm to Idaho families that will roll out for years. Only when they take action to correct this huge and damaging mistake will they show that they did not mean to harm and demean Idaho families.

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker of The 19th.  Meet Amanda and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When Kendra Sullivan woke up on Wednesday, the 43-year-old West Virginian was surprised to see that she’d gone viral overnight — in a good way.
The night before, more than 40,000 people had joined YouTube for a what’s-next meeting following the 2,700 “No Kings” pro-democracy demonstrations on Saturday attended by as many as 7 million across the country. The livestream was organized by the same broad coalition of good-government, religious and advocacy groups that arranged the protests. Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, an Appalachian activist and the first Black woman to serve as co-executive director at the Highlander Research & Education Center, a social justice leadership school in Tennessee that dates back to before the Civil Rights Movement, revved up participants by showing photos they’d submitted of Saturday’s events.
She shared a dispatch from Chattanooga, Tennessee, “my hometown, the town I was born in,” Henderson said, where “over 2,000 people came out to declare that Appalachians don’t lick boots and that ICE belongs in sweet tea, not in Tennessee!”
She thanked the thousands of people who marched in Washington for “holding down this resistance movement right on Trump’s freaking doorstep.” She gave a shoutout to senior citizens at an assisted living center in White Plains, New York, whose protest drew 350 people from 2 to 102 years old. She also relayed that pouring rain did not stop 8,000 people in Fort Worth, Texas, from “turning out to say that we see this administration for what it is, and we will not stand for rising fascism.”
Then, as the call drew to a close, Henderson concluded with a Saturday demonstration that was notable for its attendance — a single person: Sullivan.
“And last but not least, in Beckley, West Virginia, Kendra Sullivan staged a one-woman ‘No Kings’ action. Y’all didn’t hear me. I’m gonna say it one more time: In Beckley, West Virginia, Kendra Sullivan — shout out to Kendra Sullivan! — staged a one-woman ‘No Kings’ action. People confronted her. They called the cops on her. They physically threatened her, but she stayed, and she stood up for what she believed in. Kendra, we are with you,” Henderson said.
Sullivan wasn’t on Tuesday night’s call. But on Wednesday, she started seeing messages from people who’d heard about her protest during Henderson’s roundup.
“The majority are people I’ve never met, I’m not Facebook friends with and have no connection to,” Sullivan told The 19th. “I just read a message from a woman who said, ‘You make me feel so much less alone.’ Lots of them feel like a tiny blue speck in a red state.”
She never anticipated it, she said — “I forget about the power of the internet.” On Saturday, though, “I felt pretty lonely.”
Sullivan knew that she’d attend a “No Kings” event on Saturday. She described herself as more politically engaged than the average person and said she has participated in past events, but had no idea until she woke up that morning that it would be a one-woman stand.
On Friday, after work, she’d driven the two-plus hours from where she lives in Clarksburg, West Virginia, to Beckley, where she grew up, a city of about 16,000 in the southern part of the state. Her mother was headed out of town on a “girls trip” to Bermuda, Sullivan said, and had asked her to look after her dogs.
One of the signs Kendra Sullivan held up during her lone No Kings protest.

“I knew that there wasn’t a ‘No Kings’ rally in Beckley, so initially I thought I’d go to one in Charleston or Fayetteville or Lewisburg, but all of that was going to require more travel for me when I’d already driven two hours to dog sit for my mom,” Sullivan explained.
On Saturday, she woke up and told herself, “You know what? My mom lives off basically a main drive through town, so I could just walk down, hold up my sign for an hour, and call it a day — because there was no way I wasn’t going to participate.”
Sullivan ran the idea past her father, who also lives in town; he told her it was a good plan. She put in her AirPods and grabbed her handmade signs — “This aggression will not stand, man” and “ICE? Let’s get ICE off our streets and into our beverages, man,” both references to Jeff Bridges’ character “The Dude” in the film “The Big Lebowski.” Bridges had recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show and Sullivan found what he had to say “inspiring,” she said. She walked down the street to the main road and started “singing and dancing around on the street corner.”
Twenty minutes in, an older man came out of the house she was standing in front of and hung a sign supporting President Donald Trump. Then a police car pulled up, followed by another. “It was one of those moments of, ‘Oh my goodness, are they here for me?’ I wasn’t blocking traffic, I wasn’t cursing, I was just exercising my First Amendment rights,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan asked if she’d done anything wrong. The first officer, a man, told her absolutely not; they were just following up on a report that had been phoned in. The second officer, a woman, had joined him because they knew the protester was a woman on her own. The officers confirmed everything was OK and left.
Ten minutes later, a car pulled into the house where the man, still on his porch, had hung the Trump sign. A younger man got out and mentioned that his grandfather was a Korean War veteran. “I said that’s cool, but that’s not ICE,” Sullivan said. He crossed the street and told her as he took photos of her: “You can smile real pretty.”
She called 9-1-1.
The police came back, this time with a third officer. Sullivan started to cry a little. The officers, she said, “were so comforting.” They stayed with her for a half-hour or so and then went on their way. Sullivan ended up staying longer than she’d originally planned, close to two hours.
“I do know people in Beckley who went to alternate locations on Saturday, but I think you need to show your face to your actual neighbors” — or, in this case, her parents’ neighbors, as well as people she grew up with. “It’s not enough to put up a sign,” she said. “It’s important to let people know what those who don’t support this look like, that we’re just like everybody else: We are America.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kendra-Sullivan-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:16:31.667578

(Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)With a little over a week to go until Election Day, early data released by Colorado elections officials show 2025 mail ballot returns significantly outpacing figures from the past two off-year elections.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Over 354,000 Coloradans had returned their ballots as of Friday, according to a press release from the secretary of state’s office, which compiled return figures reported by the state’s 64 county clerks.
By comparison, a reported total of 266,094 voters had voted at the same point two years ago. As a percentage of active registered voters across the state, this year’s early returns put Colorado on pace for highest off-year election turnout since 2019.
The state holds coordinated elections in odd-numbered years to elect candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races, often alongside one or more statewide ballot issues. In 2025, Colorado lawmakers have referred two measures to the ballot, Propositions LL and MM, which would shore up funding for the state’s universal school meals program.

As usual, older Coloradans have made up the vast majority of voters returning a ballot so far this year. More than half of all ballots cast as of Friday were returned by voters aged 65 or older, according to the secretary of state’s data. By comparison, voters aged 18 to 34 accounted for just 8.9% of all early ballot returns.
Voters without a party affiliation, who make up half of all active Colorado voters, had returned 142,827 ballots as of Friday. Registered Republicans had returned 107,094 ballots, outpacing registered Democrats, who had returned 100,332.
Colorado voting basics
In Colorado, all active registered voters are mailed their ballots beginning 22 days before Election Day. Voters who haven’t received a ballot, or are eligible to vote but not yet registered, it’s not too late.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Today is the last day to register to vote and still receive a ballot in the mail. After today, eligible voters can still register and vote in person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
State and local elections administrators say the best way to return a ballot is by dropping it off, either in a secure drop box or at an in-person polling location. Voters who have already received a ballot can also return it through the mail, but today is the last day it’s recommended to do so to ensure enough time for delivery. A completed ballot must be received by the local county clerk by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be counted.
Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites. Voters can sign up for the state’s BallotTrax system, which tracks the status of ballots and notifies voters when their ballot is received and counted.
On average, about 1% to 2% of mail ballots in each election in Colorado are rejected because of a signature discrepancy or other issue. Voters whose ballots are rejected should receive a BallotTrax notification or a letter from their county elections office, which will include the steps they need to take to “cure” the problem and ensure their ballot is counted.

She eventually requested an on-site sign language interpreter, knowing it was one of her protected rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
“I was very demanding, because it was my son’s life on the line and I wanted to know what was going on,” Derrick recalled in an interview through an ASL interpreter.
The hospital provided an interpreter, and her son ended up being OK. But Derrick worries other deaf people in similar circumstances could have different results, especially in a state like North Dakota that lacks interpreters.
North Dakota has 15 nationally certified American Sign Language interpreters for the whole state, with none living west of U.S. Highway 83, according to a national registry.
Rep. Kathy Frelich, R-Devils Lake, highlighted the shortage during a recent legislative committee meeting. 
“I’m not sure what the answer is there, but I do need to let you know that is a problem for us,” said Frelich, who works as an adult outreach specialist from the North Dakota School for the Deaf. 
Lawmakers are studying barriers to effective communication for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Derrick, the communication and advocacy coordinator for the North Dakota School for the Deaf/Resource Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing, said she’d like to see each major city in North Dakota have at least four or five certified interpreters, giving deaf people more options during an emergency.
“It would just be easier to call interpreters, and they would be more local,” Derrick said. 
Two interpreters in the Bismarck area, Lindsey Solberg Herbel and Renae Bitner, are in high demand. They both work full time providing sign language in schools while also interpreting for medical appointments, legal hearings, industry conferences and special events like weddings or funerals. 
Solberg Herbel interpreted for then-Gov. Doug Burgum during COVID-19 pandemic press conferences and traveled to Watford City, Dickinson and other communities for meetings and official functions.
Interpreters can spend a significant amount of time traveling to appointments, Bitner said. For example, both Bitner and Solberg Herbel have traveled to interpret the Medora Musical.
“No day is the same,” Bitner said. “We try to piecemeal it together as best as we can. We try to schedule appointments after school, during days when the teachers have in-service.”
There are only eight licensed interpreters who can work in North Dakota courtrooms, according to the School for the Deaf. Interpreting in courtrooms and in a medical setting requires specialized training, said Donna Sorensen, superintendent for the School for the Deaf.
Judges often recognize how busy a sign language interpreter’s calendar is, and they will schedule around the interpreter’s availability to ensure the deaf person can have accurate communication with the court, Solberg Herbel said.
Limits of technology
During the recent legislative hearing, Sen. Michelle Powers, R-Fargo, said she noticed there are examples of artificial intelligence doing sign language interpreting that could potentially fill gaps for on-site interpreters.
Frelich said she worries about whether AI can accurately interpret someone who needs to sign back through the device’s camera. Frelich said police officers have been trained to use talk-to-text applications and other written communication to relay messages with deaf people they encounter while out on patrol.
Sorensen said video American Sign Language services are consistently improving their quality and accuracy, but context and body language can be difficult to convey through a screen. 
“And then you have technology that doesn’t work,” Sorensen said. “It pixelates. It gets blurry. It freezes, and you don’t want that when you are at a medical appointment possibly talking about life and death information.”
Derrick said deaf people also worry that emotions will not come through accurately with video interpreting and other types of assistive communication.

In 1990, President George Bush signed the American with Disabilities Act, which requires state and local governments, as well as businesses and other nonprofit organizations that serve the public, to communicate effectively with people who have communication disabilities.
According to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, communicating effectively can have different interpretations in different settings. For example, a deaf person attending a city council meeting could require an ASL interpreter or real-time captioning if they don’t use sign language. The department also said an ASL interpreter would “generally be needed” during complex medical emergencies and appointments. However, in a retail situation or other short interactions, the department said writing notes back and forth could be appropriate.
ND lacks sign language training
The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf provides the national American Sign Language certification, but it requires applicants to have a bachelor’s degree. 
There are no four-year bachelor’s degree programs that offer a major for American Sign Language in North Dakota.
Minot State University and Lake Region State College in Devils Lake formed a partnership about 15 years ago to offer a four-year degree in interpreting, said Holly Pedersen, the ASL and interpreting program director at Minot State. 
Students would learn sign language in their first two years at Lake Region and complete upper level undergraduate courses at Minot State. But it didn’t make sense for them to pause their practical-use training and then attempt to take the certification test, Pedersen said.
“Leadership at both institutions decided it wasn’t financially sustainable,” said Pedersen, also an associate professor of special education. 
Lake Region State College turned its two-year American Sign Language interpreting program into a one-year certificate in 2020 due to declining enrollment, said Lloyd Halvorson, vice president of academic and student affairs.
Halvorson said college officials have started having discussions about expanding the American Sign Language program because they see a need for it. The college may focus on providing dual-credit opportunities to local high school students in an effort to build a pipeline that could feed into a new two-year program.
“If you don’t have an introduction to that career in high school, students aren’t thinking about that career,” he said.
Lake Region also has partnership agreements for American Sign Language courses at Valley City State University and the University of North Dakota through virtual and hybrid options.
Minot State University offers courses in American Sign Language and interpreting, but only as standalone certificates or part of a minor degree program, Pedersen said. 
She said deafness is considered a “low-incidence disability” compared to other learning, speech and language and intellectual disabilities that make up the majority of special education programs in schools. In 2021, the National Deaf Center estimated about 3.6% of people in the United States considered themselves deaf or hard of hearing.
“Even though it is still really important and in need of service, it’s a small number,” Pedersen said. 
The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf also allows applicants to avoid the bachelor’s degree requirement by submitting an application outlining their college courses, interpreting experience and professional development, but that experience must equal 120 credit hours, said Catie Colamonico, certification manager for the registry.
Colamonico, in an interview through an interpreter, said most people who apply to take the national certification test have a bachelor’s degree and have gone through an ASL program. She added the alternate path to certification without a degree is typically for people with less than a four-year degree, but have been working in the field as an ASL paraprofessional, or volunteer interpreter. They then use that experience to gain credit hours on their application.

Sorensen said another way to address the interpreter shortage is to have more people in different career fields learn and use sign language.
“You may not want to be an interpreter. Maybe you want to be a nurse, but you can be a nurse that knows sign language,” she said.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers studying the barriers to effective communication with North Dakotans who are deaf will make recommendations to Legislative Management before the 2027 legislative session.
“I have mad respect for interpreters and all the work that they do,” Derrick said. “I know deaf people that cherish our interpreters and value them, because without them, there would just be a lack of communication.”

People are trying to link trails from Omaha and Lincoln through Cass County. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Facing a stalemate with Cass County in developing a recreation trail across that eastern Nebraska county, a local natural resources district is taking a new tack.
At a recent meeting, the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District voted to develop a 2.25-mile segment of trail it already owns in Cass County and to pursue trails that connect two state parks and could eventually link up with a hiking-biking bridge that spans the Platte River near Cedar Creek.
The development comes after the Cass County Board did an about face in May, deciding against approving a route across the county for a trail to connect recreation trails from Lincoln and Omaha. Such a route had been approved by the County Board last year before an election changed the board’s makeup.

Connecting the state’s two largest cities with a trail for bicyclists and hikers has been a long-time goal. But it now appears that such a connector trail is on the back burner due to disagreements about the best route.
“Obviously, the way the preferred corridor ended up in Cass County, we had to make a decision to go a different route and examine other alternatives,” said David Potter, the general manager of the NRD.
Currently, the MoPac East Trail from Lincoln ends at the unincorporated village of Wabash — about 8 miles south of the Lied Bridge. But the NRD owns another 2.25 miles of abandoned railroad bed that runs east from Wabash.
At the NRD’s Oct. 15 meeting, board members voted to pursue development of that additional 2.25 mile stretch.
“This provides additional recreational opportunities for our constituents and still leaves options for the trail to proceed north (to the Lied Bridge) once a possible route is determined,” said the NRD’s minutes from the meeting.
Potter said it also was important to make progress on the trail connection, given current state budget shortfalls. The trail connector project, which got an $8.3 million earmark from the Nebraska Legislature in 2022, has already been cut back to about $5 million as the state seeks excess funds to close a budget gap.
The NRD Board voted to seek bids to remove trees on the extension of the Mo-Pac East Trail and have its consultant work on engineering it. When asked if talks about a route for the connector trail had broken down with Cass County, Potter responded, “Good question.”
He said he has a good relationship with the Cass County Board and that perhaps, in the future, a connector trail could be developed. The chairman of the Cass County Board, Alex DeGarmo, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Friday afternoon.
Also at the NRD’s October meeting, the board approved a memorandum of understanding with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to explore development of a recreation trail to link Platte River State Park with the Louisville State Recreation Area. Currently, there is no bike trail that links the two parks, which border the Platte River.
Such a trail could eventually link up with the Lied Bridge, Potter said.
Last year, the Cass County Board voted to approve a route for the connector trail along 334th Street, a little-traveled, north-south gravel road. But in May, the board — with two new members elected in November — voted 4-1 against approving the route, and to enter talks with the NRD about a different route.
While NRD officials said the initial route chosen by Cass County was the least-expensive and impacted the fewest residents, Cass County Board members expressed concerns that the route bypassed local towns and the popular Round The Bend Steakhouse.
One projection estimated that a completed, connector trail across Cass County would generate $2.5 million in economic activity. Already, there’s a popular “nacho ride” from Lincoln to Eagle on the Mo-Pac East Trail, and a “pie ride” to Elmwood is used as a town fundraiser.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-27 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Cruel and unusual? Untreated broken arm in a Mississippi prison results in amputation,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/27/cruel-and-unusual-untreated-broken-arm-mississippi-prison-amputation/,A man serving a short sentence in a Mississippi prison for a drug violation lost a limb to infection after allegedly being denied timely treatment for a broken arm.,"Christopher Boose awoke to see a sign for the paraplegic unit at the hospital where he had arrived five hours earlier, shackled and drifting in and out of consciousness. 
“Cut it off,” he remembered the doctors shouting shortly after they had wheeled him into an operating room. “Cut it off so we don’t lose him.”    
Then everything went dark. When he came to, he tried to turn over. 
“My right arm wasn’t there,” he said. 
He started crying, and a nurse came over to reassure him: He had died on the operating table before doctors revived him. He was lucky to be alive. But they had to amputate his arm to stop the spread of sepsis.
The infection stemmed from a broken bone after Boose, then 38, fell off his bunk at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility onto his arm. Left untreated for a week, the sepsis spread.
A one-year sentence for a Drug Court infraction became a lifetime sentence as an amputee, the Newton County man alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal court for the Southern District of Mississippi.
The lawsuit targets VitalCore Health Strategies, a private company contracted to provide health care in Mississippi’s prisons. Systemic neglect gave way to “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the Constitution, the lawsuit contends.
READ THE SERIES: Behind Bars, Beyond Care: A Mississippi Today investigation into suffering, secrecy and the business of prison health care
VitalCore did not respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit or the episode that led to Boose losing an arm.    
Boose, now 40, filed his lawsuit in June and reached out to Mississippi Today after it began publishing its Behind Bars, Beyond Care series documenting alleged denial of health care in Mississippi prisons. He and his attorneys say his story is a case study of how routine injuries in prison escalate into permanent harm.
Additionally, his lawyers’ arguments aim to test a constitutional boundary: At what point under the Eighth Amendment does the delay of medical care in prison amount to cruel and unusual punishment?
‘They took my arm off’
In February of 2023, Boose, a Mississippi State University graduate and former Wells Fargo employee, was arrested for violating the terms of a Drug Court program. He was sentenced in Newton County Circuit Court to complete alcohol and drug treatment in prison, a sentence designed to be a one-year rehabilitative term, his attorney said.

He entered the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, a sprawling prison on 171 acres in Rankin County. The prison has 18 housing units, and with a capacity of about 4,000, it holds the largest number of people of any state prison.
But when Boose arrived for his sentence, it took months before he received any of the drug treatment mandated by the judge, he said in an interview. 
In phone calls from prison, Boose alerted his mother, Cynthia Boose, to the delay. She called the prison and eventually discovered the Mississippi Department of Corrections was short on drug counselors, she said in an interview. 
“I called, and they said it was because of staffing,” Cynthia said. “OK, so my son is sitting there, waiting for a treatment or waiting for a class, and y’all can’t find nobody to do it?” 
Staffing shortages have been a persistent problem for both MDOC and VitalCore. In April, the department withheld $2 million in state money for VitalCore for having inadequate staff according to its contract, Mississippi Today reported. 
An MDOC spokesperson said the department would not comment on pending litigation and did not respond to a question about the agency’s alleged shortage of drug counselors.
After about four-and-a-half months, Boose said, he began receiving drug counseling. But his treatment was interrupted by the episode that would irrevocably change his life.

On Dec. 15, 2023, Boose took a hot shower and returned to his cot in “quickbed” — a unit where inmates sleep on bunk beds in dormitory-style housing. While climbing up to his bed, he slipped and fell onto the floor, his side bearing the brunt of the impact. The pain was immediate and radiated from his elbow to his collarbone.
He asked a guard to escort him to the prison infirmary. 
“The guard told me to go sit my ass back down,” Boose said. 
Boose said he had no recourse.
That’s a problem born from the absence of an organized process for requesting medical attention, said Rep. Becky Currie, the Republican chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee. Currie has traveled to prisons around the state and spoken with inmates about issues they’ve faced when trying to get medical care.
She said inmates were often not provided any formal process for scheduling medical appointments. Some prisons also didn’t provide access to medical professionals overnight.
At a legislative budget hearing in September, Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain said Central Mississippi Correctional Facility has sent some prison nurses directly into inmate dormitories because requests for medical visits have gone unanswered in the past.
“Inmates would say they signed up for a sick call, and nobody ever sees them,” Cain said. “But we have to track the sick call sign-up to be sure that it’s actually seen and utilized, and they actually see the doctor.”
Over the next week after his fall, Boose’s arm started to swell. He said he repeatedly asked for help, to no avail. As the swelling worsened, he periodically lost consciousness, prompting other inmates to ask guards for help on his behalf. 
The conditions inside Mississippi’s prisons have at times forced inmates to advocate for each other, according to an ex-corrections official who spoke to Mississippi Today. She once encountered inmates carrying a man whose legs appeared to be rotting across the prison, trying to find help for him. 
About seven days after his fall, Boose was taken to the infirmary, where nurses X-rayed his arm and sent him back to his cell with a sling. The swelling continued, and Boose believes he would have died had it not been for a routine sweep by an officer with a dog, searching for drugs.
The officer saw the state of Boose’s arm and urged prison officials to take him to the hospital. 
Editor’s note: The photo below, which can be seen by sliding the button, is graphic and may not be suitable for some readers. It shows the state of Christopher Boose’s arm before amputation in December of 2023.

There, doctors found “massive tissue and muscle damage from the bacterial infection” caused by the delay in treating Boose’s broken arm, his attorneys wrote in the complaint. His arm was amputated at the shoulder.
After nearly dying in emergency surgery and losing an arm, Boose called his mother and told her what happened. It was Christmas Eve. 
“I’ll never forget it. Me and my sister had just finished cooking,” she said. “He called and said, ‘Hey, Ma. Merry Christmas Eve.’ I said, ‘Oh, son, so glad to hear your voice, but I was worried. He said, ‘Well, I got one arm. They took my arm off.’”
Boose remained in the hospital for several days and was then granted early release from custody on Jan. 12, 2024.
Boose and his attorneys argue that the permanent disability he now suffers is the direct result of postponed medical care. Their lawsuit argues the postponement of such care qualifies as “cruel and unusual punishment.”
What is ‘deliberate indifference’? 
In a damning 2024 report, the U.S. Department of Justice accused Mississippi of violating the constitutional rights of those held in four prisons, including Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. 
The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment. It should be read to prohibit “prison officials from being deliberately indifferent to conditions of confinement that pose an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,” the DOJ report said.
According to the report, Cain, the state corrections commissioner, has acknowledged that Mississippi is “not where it need[s] to be in terms of running a safe prison system.”
Boose’s attorneys – Warren Martin and Robert Thompson – quoted that line in their complaint. Its legal argument is rooted in the concept of “deliberate indifference,” the legal standard needed to prove cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. 
“The delay of medical care,” the complaint said, “constituted an Eighth Amendment violation … manifesting deliberate indifference” to Boose’s medical needs.
VitalCore, the recipient of hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars through its contract with the Corrections Department, “failed to adopt a strategy to protect the safety, health and lives of inmates in MDOC custody,” the complaint said. This, the complaint argues, reflects deliberate indifference. 
In its 2024 report, the Justice Department said deliberate indifference requires the proof that prison officials were actually aware of “an excessive risk to inmate health or safety” and disregarded that risk.
If Boose’s legal argument succeeds, it would be an outlier, according to legal data
In 2024, Business Insider examined nearly 1,500 cases in federal appellate courts that involved Eighth Amendment claims. The news outlet found that only 1% of prisoner claims succeed, with almost half failing to meet the strict deliberate-indifference standard. 
Boose’s complaint seeks $5 million in damages for the Newton County man, who has since returned to live with his mother. She still helps him tie his shoes and put on a belt. He receives disability benefits in lieu of steady employment. He suffers from “phantom limb,” the sensation that an amputated limb is still attached.
The condition sometimes causes him to lose his balance and fall, transporting his mind back to the rickety bunk at CMCF from which he fell nearly two years ago. 
Unlike that December night, his mother is often nearby to help when he falls. But inside prison, “Anything could happen,” Boose said.

Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti this week claimed victory in the case, saying the rule “force(d) radical gender ideology into every corner of American health care.” Skrmetti noted in a news release that the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri not only eliminates the current protections but “makes it more difficult for future administrations to revive them.”
Skrmetti and Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch led a 15 Republican state coalition challenging the rule to protect patients from gender-identity discrimination in programs such as Medicaid, Medicare. the Affordable Care Act plans and other programs receiving federal funding.
The rule was adopted by the Obama Administration, set aside under Trump’s first administration then reinstated by President Joe Biden. It was intended to protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination in doctors’ offices and preserve access to gender affirming care for transgender patients based on Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex for recipients of federal dollars.
The appeals court, however, concluded that when Congress enacted Title IX in 1972, it “only contemplated biological sex.”
The decision was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr., a George W. Bush-appointee.

It could get even scarier soon.
The family is among the roughly 563,080 Kentuckians who may have a hard time feeding themselves in November as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will run out of funds if the government shutdown persists. Also, the state is decreasing small cash payments that go to the Hardin County grandmother and about 15,000 other extremely low-income families in November. Those payments could cease altogether in December if Congress still has not voted to fund the government. 
The Kentucky Lantern spoke to two heads of kinship care families in Kentucky who are facing belt tightening as the federal and state governments restrict safety net services. 
At their requests, the Lantern is not using their last names. Kimberly, 58, of Hardin County, fears that publicizing her family’s plight could result in losing her grandchildren to foster care. Samantha, 40, from Daviess County, is concerned about the safety of her kinship charges and that publicizing their story will make the children’s already difficult situation worse. 
Kimberly has no idea what she’s going to do with already no wiggle room in her budget, she said. 
“You budget out things to stretch, but then you run out, and then you have to use the money you put back to buy that, or somebody gets a hole in a tennis shoe, or outgrows clothes,” she told the Lantern. “You pray that you don’t get sick, or somebody doesn’t get sick, or the car doesn’t break down, because I don’t have that kind of money. If I had a flat tire today, I wouldn’t have the money to fix that tire.” 
Kimberly earns $14.50 an hour at her full-time job, income that covers her $1,400 rent, utilities and car payment, she said. According to a notice from the cabinet she received and shared with the Lantern, her monthly benefit for all four grandchildren is $426 starting Nov. 1, down from $656 from the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP) program. 
The government assistance Kimberly receives helps cover diapers, gas to take the children to the doctor, baby formula and food, among other basic necessities. The grandchildren currently living with her are ages 10, 8, two and eight months. 
“Every penny counts,” she said. “With everything so high, every little bit helps.”
‘Some pretty hard juggling’ 
Increased demand and limited resources led the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to cut KTAP payments to low-income families by about 35%, beginning Nov. 1. The cut is expected to especially strain Kentucky’s kinship care families, 42% of whom receive KTAP support, according to Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
KTAP, which comes from federal funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, benefits eligible low-income families for a maximum of 60 months, which do not have to be consecutive, over the course of a lifetime.
Gov. Andy Beshear announced on Oct. 20 that, with the federal government shut down, Kentucky does not expect to receive TANF dollars for November. The state is going to foot the costs for November, but cannot guarantee anything beyond that. 
For Kimberly, these cuts likely mean “some pretty hard juggling” and taking on more hours at work, she said. 
“The fear in the back of my mind,” she said, is: “If I was to ever get sick, what’s going to happen to these kids?” 
‘Just scraping by’ 
Sickness is an issue that family head Samantha of Owensboro, has already dealt with in her kinship care journey. She took custody of her minor cousins — sisters, ages 5 and 7 at the time — while still in her 20s. She later fought and won custody while the sisters’ parents dealt with addiction and incarceration issues, determined to keep her little cousins out of the foster care system. 
Samantha, now 40, was diagnosed with Stage 2 cervical cancer in 2018. She had to undergo a hysterectomy in Nashville and then had daily radiation treatments. 
Her chemotherapy treatment, cisplatin, left her too sick  to care for her children. She sent her biological daughter to Ohio to stay with family and asked the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to set her cousins up with temporary foster care during her treatment. It didn’t go well. The respective six and 14-month stints the girls spent in foster care left them feeling unsupported both mentally and physically, Samantha said. Both eventually came back home before she recovered. 
Samantha still cares for the younger cousin, who is 16, and her biological daughter. Her older cousin is 19 and no longer at home. 
Since her bout with cancer, Samantha developed lymphedema, which hinders her ability to move and, thus, to work. She babysits part time and survives mostly on her Social Security Disability Insurance. She also receives Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and KTAP, a benefit that she expects to drop to $244 in November. 
Her KTAP helps cover groceries and other small bills, she said. 
“It’s paycheck to paycheck, just scraping by,” she said. 
Her plan now is to lean heavily on local food banks for pantry staples and to try and cook more rice and bean meals in the future. 
“I’m living off the government, but that’s not a choice that I wanted to make,” Samantha said. “That wasn’t my choice. I didn’t ask to get cancer. I didn’t ask for my cousins to abandon their children. I didn’t ask for that. This is just what I was given, and I’m making the best out of what I was given.” 
Samantha worries about further cuts to social services, like SNAP. She also lives in a Section 8 apartment. SNAP cuts at the federal level are expected to strain Kentucky’s population in need of food assistance. 
“Once they have cut the food stamps,” Samantha said, “is my housing next?” 
Still, she’s resilient. She thinks about families who have babies in need of formula and who are worse off than herself, she said. 
“I have woke up on days and faced worse battles than this,” she said. “And I’ll figure out a way to keep going.” 
‘Every penny counts.’ 
Since 1999, Kimberly has helped raise 14 of her grandchildren who couldn’t be raised by their parents because of addiction and neglect issues. Those children are among the roughly 55,000 Kentucky youth being raised with a relative, according to a report from Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
Her grandchildren have Medicaid health care coverage and her family also gets SNAP food benefits. Even with her work and KTAP, Kimberly said without SNAP “we wouldn’t have hardly anything.”
Already, there’s “nothing left at the end of the month,” Kimberly said. She expressed feeling “blessed” to have her benefits, but is worried about other programs like SNAP and Medicaid getting scaled back as well. 
She’s too young to retire right now, at 58, but isn’t sure she’ll be able to in the next 10-15 years, either. 
Her grandchildren don’t know that belt-tightening is coming, she said. She’s focused on keeping a “stable environment” for them, physically and emotionally because “they’ve been through too much already.” 
“I love my grandkids. I’d do anything in the world for them — and I have,” she said. She’ll do everything in her power to keep them out of the foster care system, she said. “We’re trying to keep these kids with a family member and not with a stranger.” 
Research shows that is important — being with a relative, when possible, is better for children’s wellbeing than being placed with a stranger.  
“This is not political for me,” Kimberly said. “If I’m not there, helping my grandkids, then what’s going to happen to them?”

(Stock photo by Getty Images)Amid the ongoing budget impasse, Democratic state House lawmakers have offered a compromise to Republicans who see public cyber charter schools as a lifeline for parents whose children aren’t thriving in traditional schools.
The commonwealth’s 14 taxpayer-funded cyber charters have been the subject of scrutiny for soaring bank balances and questionable spending under a funding system that hasn’t been updated since online charters were first allowed a quarter century ago.
A bill passed earlier this month in the House and awaiting consideration in the Senate includes a new method to calculate how much school districts must pay for each student who attends a cyber charter. According to the House Democratic Caucus, it would save an estimated $173 million for the commonwealth’s 500 public school districts.
Susan Spicka, director of the public school advocacy group Education Voters PA, said this  would be a significant development, even though the cost reduction is a fraction of what a single statewide tuition rate would achieve. 
“Is it everything we need? Absolutely not. But is it a step in the right direction? Yes,” Spicka said. “This is very much an outlier in Pennsylvania to say we are taking a serious look at these cyber charters and taking a substantial step to make the system of funding them a little more rational.”
Tim Eller, chief branding and government relations officer for the state’s largest cyber charter school Commonwealth Charter Academy, said the reduction would be equivalent to a 21% reduction in the school’s $500 million budget. The impact would be significant, he said.
“Would it completely change us? I don’t think it would, completely,” Eller said, adding that CCA, which enrolls about 34,000 students, could weather the change better than smaller cyber schools. “You don’t lose $100 million and continue operations as they were.”
House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said the major concern with cyber charter schools is the tuition bears little relationship to the actual cost of running an online school.
“There are things that school districts pay for that cyber schools get reimbursed for that no one can explain why,” Schweyer said, noting costs such as property maintenance and sports programs aren’t present in online charters.

Senate Education Committee Chairperson Lynda Schlegel Culver (R-Northumberland) was not available for an interview this week. A spokesperson for Culver said the proposal was not agreed to and that Culver supports fully funding all public school options for parents to choose the best education for their children.
Under the commonwealth’s charter school law, public school districts must pay the same for each student attending a charter school as it pays for students within its own buildings.
Because every district in Pennsylvania establishes its own budget and per-pupil spending rate, a single charter school can receive a broad range of tuition payments from each one where it draws students.
The amounts ranged from $6,975 to $25,150 for regular education students and $18,329 to $60,166 for special education students.
Among Gov. Josh Shapiro’s education priorities when he introduced his $51.6 billion budget plan in February was establishing a flat statewide tuition for cyber charter schools. His office estimated it would save school districts $600 million that could be used for programs in traditional schools.
That plan was also part of Shapiro’s 2024-2025 spending proposal, but since then, Republican state Auditor General Timothy DeFoor released the result of a three-year audit of five cyber charters’ finances. It showed budget reserves that grew by 144% and “uncommon” spending practices, such as paying bonuses to teachers and the acquisition of 21 physical properties by CCA.
Republicans, whose approval in the Senate is needed to pass a budget, have staunchly opposed Shapiro’s flat tuition proposal, saying it would harm cyber charters and reduce choices for parents in where to send their children for a public education.
“If we can’t get consensus on a flat rate, can we at the very least agree we shouldn’t be spending money on things that cyber schools don’t need?” Schweyer said, adding that cyber charter students have the right to participate in extracurricular activities in the districts where they live.
When the House passed its latest budget plan earlier this month, it also approved Senate Bill 315. The legislation, introduced by Culver as a bill to make funding for Career and Technical Education more predictable, was amended in the House to include new categories of expenses that school districts could deduct from cyber charter tuition. 
“We don’t reimburse cyber schools for any sort of bus transportation,” Schweyer said. “We are creating new deductions based on the things that the cyber schools don’t provide.”
Those would include tuition for non-special education students, the cost of tax assessment and collection services, 60% of student activity costs and 60% of building operations and maintenance costs.

Dylan Wyatt, director of advocacy for the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials, said the additional deductions are a good first step.
“I think a lot of districts had the hope that some kind of flat cap rate would be passed, understanding that would be a tall order for our legislature,” he said.
If the deductions are passed, they would replace the $100 million reimbursement for charter school tuition that was included in the last budget. Because the amount that each district received was based on the number of charter school students, some would receive more relief if the reimbursement remained in place. 
But, Wyatt added, if the rest of Shapiro’s education proposal becomes part of the final budget, the majority of districts would end up in a better financial situation with the deductions.
Shapiro’s proposal includes $526 million for Ready to Learn block grants which are used to distribute funding for the state’s most underfunded school districts. The so-called adequacy funding was included in the last budget to address 2023 a court ruling that found the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund education was unconstitutional.
It also called for a $75 million increase in basic education funding and a $40 million increase in special education funding. Both budget bills passed in the Democratic-led House included all three increases, while the Senate’s proposals would flat-fund education.
“If we see, in addition to the cyber charter deductions … what the governor proposed, the majority of school districts would be in a better position,” Wyatt said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/school_stock-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 05:57:23.278423

(Stock image)With the federal shutdown in its fourth week, spurred by a stalemate over the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans on Affordable Care Act plans, a new report shows that over 154 million people with coverage through an employer also face steep price hikes — and that the situation is likely to get worse.
Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
It’s the first time in two decades that the cost of covering a family of four has risen by 6% or more for three consecutive years, data from KFF shows.
Over the last five years, the average premium for family coverage has increased by 26%, compared with a 29% increase in workers’ wages and nearly 24% growth in inflation. The average cost for family coverage is now about the same as a new Toyota Corolla hybrid.
The average annual premium for an individual health plan provided by employers increased by 5% to $9,325 — nearly $3,000 higher than in 2016, according to the survey.
“It’s a concern as health costs just keep going up,” said Eric Trump, controller at Steve Reiff Inc., a small company in South Whitley, Indiana, that specializes in sandblasting and painting heavy equipment.
Trump, who is not related to President Donald Trump, said his company’s health insurance costs rose 8% for the 2026 fiscal year — roughly the same as they have in the last few years.
Workers at Reiff pay about half the cost of their health coverage. About half of its 20 current employees decline the insurance because they get coverage through a family member or choose to go uninsured, he said. “There’s not a lot we can do as we don’t have enough employees to spread out the costs.”
Most people with job-based insurance contribute to the cost of their premiums, with the average worker this year contributing $1,440 for individual coverage or $6,850 for family coverage.
Over time, more workers have paid increasingly higher deductibles, the amount they must spend out-of-pocket on medical services before their insurer pitches in. More than one‑third of covered workers are enrolled in a plan with a deductible of $2,000 or more for an individual. The share of workers with such a plan has increased 32% over the last five years and 77% over the last 10 years, the report said.
Rising drug and hospital costs are often cited as major culprits for rising health insurance costs, and neither shows signs of ebbing.
“Early reports suggest that cost trends will be higher for 2026, potentially leading to higher premium increases unless employers and plans find ways to offset higher costs through changes to benefits, cost sharing, or plan design,” the KFF survey said.

One big concern among employers is the high price of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, which a growing number of companies cover. Their high prices, combined with strong demand, have led some workplaces to tighten or eliminate coverage for weight loss.
“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” study author Gary Claxton, a KFF senior vice president, said in a press release. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
Employers typically respond to higher health costs by shifting costs to their workers, but it’s unclear how much more financial pain workers can take. The survey found nearly half of large employers said their employees have “moderate” or “high” concerns about their level of cost sharing.
While the rising cost of employer-sponsored insurance has outpaced general inflation, the issue received scant attention in recent months on Capitol Hill. To help pay for extending tax cuts, Trump’s tax and spending law reduces by billions of dollars the amount the government spends on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for 70 million low-income and disabled people. Congressional budget scorekeepers predict the cuts to Medicaid will lead to millions more people becoming uninsured over the next decade.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Democrats refuse to vote for a new spending measure unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits that help about 22 million people buy health coverage through the ACA marketplaces. Without congressional action, the tax credits will expire, and premiums will double for many consumers, starting in January.
The KFF report is based on a survey this year of 1,862 randomly selected nonfederal public and private employers with 10 or more workers.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Things look dire upon an initial glance at the Rhode Island Office of Veterans Services’ fiscal year 2027 budget request.
The office suggests that to meet what the state calls a “constrained” budget scenario — a 7.5% spending cut across state agencies — it would need to cut 32 contracted jobs. That, in turn, would eliminate 32 beds at the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol, and lead to an even longer waiting list for veterans who often wait 16 to 18 months for admission.
But state budget documents are not the most intuitive reading material, and Veterans Services offered more than one possibility for the upcoming fiscal year. The state’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires all state agencies to offer two funding scenarios in their annual requests for state money: One is the amount needed to sustain current operations, and the other is the stricter 7.5% cut. 
The state budget office discouraged agencies from sending in “unconstrained” proposals — essentially an agency wishlist — or “expansionary proposals,” in the words of spokesperson Derek Gomes, because of the projected deficit heading into fiscal 2027. 
Current projections for fiscal year 2027, which begins on July 1, 2026, forecast a $304.3 million deficit. 
That deficit is “within reason for the last few years,” Gomes said. Still, it’s nearly $42 million higher than the deficit for the current fiscal year and more than double the deficit for fiscal year 2025.
‘Off the table’
“The governor’s not going to shut down another wing; that’s off the table,” Laura Hart, a spokesperson for the governor, told Rhode Island Current in a recent phone call. “It’s a no-go.” 
The 208-bed facility housed 141 residents — mostly men over the age of 75 who served in Vietnam, Korea and World War II — at the time of the Oct. 1 budget request by the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, the parent agency of the veterans office. 
Parker Gavigan, spokesperson for the veterans services office, said the immediate goal is to increase the number of residents at the home to its 160 maximum within several weeks, “while ensuring every veteran receives the highest standard of care.”
As of Friday, Oct. 24, Gavigan said the home had 144 residents in beds that include skilled nursing care. Another three residents live in the home’s domicile unit, more comparable to assisted living. Ten veterans are expected to be admitted around Nov. 1, Gavigan said.
There were 211 veterans on the home’s waiting list, when the budget request was submitted on Oct. 1. As of Friday, Oct. 24, it had increased to 214.
“From that list, three are cleared and ready for admission,” Gavigan said. 
The governor must submit a balanced budget to the General Assembly in January, where it will then spend the subsequent months getting hammered into its final shape by legislators by the end of June, right before the new fiscal year begins on July 1.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
“Ultimately, not all of those recommendations or proposals will be accepted by the governor’s office,” Gomes said. “So that’s kind of where the discretion is.”
For instance, this is the second consecutive year the Veterans Services office proposed closing a neighborhood at the veterans home to meet the constrained budget framework. The office’s fiscal 2026 request, filed in fall 2024, is recapped in the enacted budget summary by the House Fiscal Advisory Staff.
This option would have “shut down the home’s Alpha-1 neighborhood” and the Veterans Services office “would have to cease admissions, wait for ten current residents to expire, and move five people to open rooms in the Bravo and Charlie neighborhoods.”
Neither McKee nor the General Assembly humored that suggestion. Neither party endorsed Veterans’ Services’ other ask last year either, for four new positions — three “cemetery specialists” and one customer service role —  at the Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Exeter. The office anticipated more burials under the federal Burial Equity for Guards and Reserves Act. 
The veterans services office ultimately received $3 million more in the current fiscal year than it asked for, with its funding at just under $53 million in the enacted budget. 
What would happen if …
When budget request season arrives each fall, state agencies still have to hypothesize what would happen if they performed under their current benchmark.  
“For some smaller agencies, where most of, if not the vast majority of, their costs are tied to personnel, it’s harder to achieve a 7.5% reduction,” Gomes, said. “But to comply with the spirit of the request, the agencies comply.”
Some do not comply. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha refused to submit a constrained proposal this year, noting that the only way to achieve the mandated 7.5% spending cut would eliminate positions “critical to the mission of the Office.”
“Such cuts would severely undermine public safety, and significantly hamper our ability to defend the State and fight on behalf of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha wrote in his Oct. 1 budget submission. “Accordingly, I cannot responsibly put forth such a budget proposal.”
The veterans services office, in complying with the request, noted its worst case scenario — the closure of 32 beds — would generate an estimated $1.65 million of savings in general revenue savings and a total of $2.73 million in savings across all funding sources. 
These savings “would come at a significant operational and human cost,” Veterans Services Director Kasim J. Yarn wrote in his cover letter to his office’s fiscal year 2027 budget request.
“Implementing this cut would close an entire 32-bed neighborhood, directly reducing the Home’s capacity to serve aging veterans,” Yarn wrote in his Oct. 1 letter. “This would lead to a decrease in resident population, a loss of per diem and maintenance fee revenue, and a diminished ability to admit new veterans — ultimately undermining our mission to provide timely, high-quality care to those who served.”
The agency recommendation at the top of the proposal states outright that this is not the path the office wants to pursue: “If asked to make budgetary cuts, there will be severe consequences to vital services at our Veterans Home — a scenario we hope to avoid,” the document reads. 
There were 211 veterans on the home’s waiting list, when the budget request was submitted on Oct. 1. Cutting the 32 positions — all directly involved in patient care — would close an unidentified 32-bed wing at the home. That in turn would “dramatically increase the waiting list timeframe” and “the admittance of new residents will cease for months,” according to the budget document.    
The constrained proposal would allow for replacement hires of current full-timers should they leave but would otherwise freeze hiring for 23 full-time certified nursing assistant positions.

Yarn noted in his cover letter that the Veterans Home already has a shortage of certified nursing assistants and, in a more ideal spending environment, the office recommends that the state raise their pay. 
In its wishlist — or unconstrained — budget request, Yarn’s office asked for $51.2 million. That includes raising certified nursing assistant pay scales at a projected cost of $425,951. Doing so, Yarn said, would help the veterans home move away from contracted agency labor, which now accounts about 50% of its patient care workforce, and would produce savings in subsequent years. The extra money would also buy “an advanced fall detection system” to mitigate resident falls at the home — a major issue, Yarn wrote, with about 32 occurring every month.
Even if the wing closure will likely not happen, other constrained proposals may succeed. Yarn’s office also floated the idea of ending Saturday burials at Exeter’s Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery, estimated to save about $30,000 in overtime costs. Rhode Island and Connecticut are the only New England states which offer Saturday burials. In the past few years, the budget document notes, Rhode Island has averaged about $35,000 annually in overtime costs related to Saturday burials. 
Another possibility is charging a “modest” burial fee of $978 per plot for veterans’ eligible spouses and dependents to be buried at the Veterans Cemetery. Twenty-six of the 41 U.S. states with veterans cemeteries charge interment fees for non-veteran family members, the office said, but Rhode Island does not. This change could yield an estimated $503,670 in annual revenue, based on the 515 veterans’ family members, including spouses and dependents, who were interred at the cemetery on average per year over the last six years.
The governor’s office will review the proposals over the ensuing months, and McKee will submit his initial draft of the budget to the General Assembly in January. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson offered a joint statement last week on the veterans’ office’s budget request for fiscal year 2027.
“Our respective Finance committees will carefully review all agency budget requests next session, including any proposals the Governor recommends in his budget,” Shekarchi and Lawson wrote. “Veterans’ services remain a priority for the General Assembly, and we will continue working to balance limited taxpayer resources with many areas of need.”

(Photo by Anne Vilen / The Daily Yonder)I drove more than 7,000 miles this summer, from North Carolina to Montana and back, through vast swathes of rural America, tent camping most nights in state or national parks.
This is what I learned: Americans from every zipcode, walk of life, and political persuasion love their public lands.
We don’t want to sell them, develop them, or monetize them. In fact, spending time in these co-owned spaces—literally, our common ground—is a great way to build a shared understanding of America’s diversity, strength, and resilience.
Early in my journey, I spent two nights at Cuivre River State Park, a wild tract of woods and water outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It was hot as a frog in a frying pan that afternoon, but the four twenty-somethings who pulled into the campsite next to mine were undeterred. They leapt out of their old Camry, lit up some weed, swore loudly and casually at their janky tent, and started scouring the campground for firewood.
So much for tranquility, I thought.
Then I remembered how my Dad always reached out to make good neighbors across rising fences — even in a campground. I walked over and offered the boys all of my remaining firewood.
Surprised by the gesture of goodwill from a solo woman easily the age of their grandmothers, they ma’amed me multiple times, explained that they were celebrating someone’s 21st birthday, and apologized for being rowdy. We parted as the katydids started sawing loudly in the dark trees overhead. The next morning, as I poured my first cup of coffee, one of the boys came over and gave me a box of energy bars. “We gotta head into work,” he said. “But thanks for the wood.” It was a peaceful outing after all – for all of us.
A thousand miles and five states later, I ventured into Sentinel Meadows, on the edge of Yellowstone National Park’s famous geyser basin. Alone, I followed the winding trail beside a rippling creek and then through oatgrass and sedges into a broad expanse of field powdered with the white silica-rich deposits of active steam vents. Far away, near what looked like smoke circles rising from the earth, I was surprised and curious to see an army of little green men!
When I got closer, I learned that the people in neon vests were a group of biochemists from Arizona State University, permitted by the National Park Service to study what lives in the soils around geyser basins. “Why should we care about that?” I asked one young graduate student.
“We want to understand the relationships between the organisms and the water in what seems like an inhospitable ecosystem. Some bacteria thrive in hot water, others live without light. That can help us understand the conditions where life is possible even on other worlds.”
A trail’s turn after I left the scientists, a shaggy coyote burst out of the pines about 30 yards in front of me. We both lurched backward, jaws dropping. For a split second, before she bolted back into the trees, we stared at each other. And in the golden marbles of her eyes, I imagined another world–not human, but sentient and thriving.
At Devil’s Tower National Monument in Wyoming, I had a different multicultural experience. I arrived nearly at daybreak and circumnavigated the tower on foot before other visitors arrived. Serenaded by bird song and the hush of wind through junipers, I photographed the stone edifice behind fluttering prayer flags, honoring an ancient sacred place.

Back at the visitor’s center by mid-morning, hundreds of motorcycles were roaring into the parking lot, en route to the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Bearded, leathered, and lathered with sweat, they too were enjoying their public lands. To ensure that the bikers, as well as families, a bus load of French tourists, park staff, and other visitors stayed safe, a gang of Christian Cyclists was directing traffic.  “This is our public service,” one burly tattooed woman told me. “Have a blessed day.”
Road weary in week four of my journey, I pulled into a public rest area outside of Chamberlain, South Dakota, where I was greeted by yet another sacred symbol on public lands. The Dignity of Earth and Sky Statue is a 50-foot-tall, stainless steel rendering of a Lakota woman wrapped in a traditional star quilt. The artist, Dale Cloude Lamphere, I read on the inscription, sculpted this tribute to native women in the hope that “Dignity will . . . encourage all of us to embrace our similarities and celebrate our differences.”
Just down the road, in a public park beside the Missouri River, I saw that hope in action.  I shared a walking path with Donna Kocer, a Chamberlain retiree, who volunteers her mornings to pick up trash from the riverbank and beautify the park.  “Aren’t there park staff whose job that is?” I asked her.  “Maybe,” she said. “But it’s a public park, and I’m the public. I feel responsible for keeping it clean because it’s mine.”
We walked a while together, gabbing about how there’s a lovely surprise around every turn in South Dakota, a state most people prefer to fly over. And then we stopped to watch a group of Amish women in gingham bonnets, long skirts, and sneakers playing volleyball next to the pavilion, with the wide Missouri rolling along behind them.
After Minneapolis, Madison, and Chicago, I took a wrong turn and impulsively followed a sign to Indiana Dunes National Park–a tiny, vestigial spit of sand and marsh clinging to the edge of Lake Michigan between Gary and Michigan City. I walked out to the shore where a Spanish-speaking family was enjoying a picnic of empanadas and rootbeer on the sand. A few miles down the beach to my left, the massive smoke stacks of U.S. Steel’s midwestern plant belched gray clouds. To my right, the cooling tower of the city power plant rose behind hundreds of rail containers. Just two percent of Indiana lands are public. If it’s up to some in Congress, that fraction too will be privatized, industrialized, and monetized.
The story of public lands in America is the story of opposing appetites. One hungers for beauty, solitude, and adventure. The other craves conquest, power, and progress. Republican senators (and their constituents) objected loudly and successfully to remove a provision from the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill that would have mandated the sale of federal lands.
However, Trump’s Justice Department, going against previous legal determinations,  believes the president has the right to abolish national monuments (like Devil’s Tower) without congressional approval.
Another recent action eliminates the Roadless Rule, opening up millions of pristine acres where wildlife and endangered species thrive without habitat disruption from logging, mining, and other development.
And finally, a recent effort to revoke the Bureau of Land Management’s Public Lands Rule devalues the work of conservation scientists, like those I met in Sentinel Meadows, so that uses that monetize natural resources, like mining, logging, and recreation, take precedence on public lands.
In Kentucky, paddling up Clifty Creek through the Daniel Boone National Forest, I thought about what these incursions into public lands would bring. I watched a wood duck shyly hide itself against the riverbank, behind the veil of a lacy waterfall. Then, turning downriver to take in the sun-bright bluffs arching over cool green water, I spotted a fisherman in another kayak, the first human I’d seen that day.

“It’s a beautiful day out here,” I offered in greeting.
“Isn’t every day a beautiful day out here?” he responded, tipping his paddle at our surroundings.
Suddenly, we both startled as a bald eagle, a species brought back from the brink of extinction by 20th-century conservation efforts, strafed the river and soared into the tree above our heads. The fisherman and I watched in silent awe, and then I whispered the only answer that made sense. “Yes.”
The House Committee on Natural Resources recently convened at Jenny Lake, a popular lodge in Grand Tetons National Park, ostensibly to support park funding, while elsewhere, government officials are busy carving up the pie of public lands that belong to you and me.
The Persian poet Rumi wrote, “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.” That field – dense with wildflowers and native grasses and buzzing insects, alive with birds and mice and maybe a hunting fox – is where I’d like to take our government decision makers. Up the trail into the mountains, alongside ordinary Americans who’ve come to hike or investigate or pray or celebrate a birthday or fish or just ride their motorcycles through our extraordinary public lands, they too might be inspired to be curious about “the other” people and creatures that inhabit our wild spaces.
And that curiosity is the seed from which understanding and unity grow.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)When he ran for reelection during the 2023-24 election cycle, Kentucky Republican Brett Guthrie raised $851,493 during the first nine months of his campaign.
Then he ascended to the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in January 2025 — and more than tripled his fundraising.
And the amount of money he raised from political action committees — the vehicle that allows corporations and other special interests to help fund congressional campaigns — also grew, to $1.6 million between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 from $651,800 during the same period two years earlier, Federal Election Commission records show. That was more money from PACs than any other House candidate except Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
One reason he did so well: Guthrie raised money from around 100 PACs that had never written him a check before he became the committee chair this year, according to FEC and OpenSecrets data.
“It’s the obvious game of campaign contributions,” said Craig Holman, who lobbies on campaign finance issues for Public Citizen. “You make campaign contributions and expenditures to those who have direct influence over what policies you’re pursuing. That’s the influence peddling game at its rawest. This is the classic case of why campaign contributions really are legalized bribery.”
Guthrie isn’t alone. A look at congressional fundraising during the first six months of 2025 found several newly minted Senate and House chairs receiving checks from special interest PACs that had kept their checkbooks closed until the lawmakers got their hands on a gavel.
Consider:

The Walt Disney Co.’s PAC didn’t support Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in any of his previous Senate campaigns until this year, when he became chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which oversees the broadcasting industry. Disney, which donated $5,000, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
New Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) received his first-ever donation, $2,500, from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, after landing the gavel of a panel with a health care subcommittee.
The Teamsters Union PAC made its first contribution to the campaign of Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), in the amount of $1,000, after he became chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over unions. The Teamsters did not respond to a request for comment.

“They’re not making those donations out of goodwill but they’re making an investment and they expect a return on that money,” said Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United/Let America Vote, an advocacy group that supports stronger campaign finance laws.
“That return can be in the form of what gets investigated, what gets ignored, what legislation makes it out of committee, what hearings are held,” she said. “You see corporate donors and corporate interests driving the agenda with these committees time and time again.”

Guthrie did not respond to requests for comment.
He chairs the committee whose jurisdiction was once described this way by former Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.): “If it moves, it’s energy; and if it doesn’t, it’s commerce.”
Mercedes-Benz gave its first-ever PAC donation to Guthrie this year, $1,000. The Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over auto safety and emissions standards.
The money was donated at an auto industry event hosted by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation’s PAC, company spokeswoman Melinda Mernovage said.
Guthrie also received $5,000 from the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns local stations throughout the country and temporarily took talk show host Jimmy Kimmel off the air of its ABC affiliates following his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
And his campaign took in $1,500 from Oracle, the technology company.
Neither company responded to a request for comment.
Muller said PACs “make these decisions on who they support on what’s best for their business. I’m not surprised that committee chairs are reaping the biggest rewards because they have the most power.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Each month, when his Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds arrive, Daniel Garratt stocks up meats and pantry staples like canned goods in bulk at Walmart. He then visits local discount or dollar stores for nonperishable items. 
Fresh produce, however, is something that he buys sporadically throughout the month at his neighborhood grocery store, The Market At 25th. There, he benefits from the Virginia Fresh Match program, which offers discounts on produce. Garratt has even invested in a vacuum sealer to make his food last longer and reduce waste.
Despite living in a facility for senior citizens and people with disabilities, much of his Social Security income still goes toward rent. Having been disabled for more than 20 years, Garratt has learned to get creative in stretching his dollars. 
“My rent goes up every year,” he said, as his cat, Sawyer, curled up in his lap. 
He’s watching November’s planned grocery haul with concern amid Congress’ monthlong government shutdown, which means Garratt — along with roughly 850,000 other Virginians — would not receive SNAP that month. Nationwide, more than 42 million people rely on the program. 
SNAP helps low-income earners and people who can’t work afford groceries. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, has told states to pause November payments until further notice. 
At a press conference Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said she and her colleagues are urging the USDA to tap into its contingency funding for SNAP. However, that $6 million reserve falls short of the $8 million needed to support those who depend on the program.  
Virginia’s food banks also emphasized that they would be unable to absorb the higher demand if SNAP goes unfunded next month. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin has since declared a state of emergency, allowing him to use emergency funds to “provide food benefits.”
The Congressional stalemate has dragged on since early October, as federal lawmakers failed to agree on annual appropriations bills. Multiple attempts from members of both parties to pass a continuing resolution have collapsed. 
Democrats have sought to extend federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act during negotiations, while Republicans — who control both chambers of Congress — have blamed Democrats for the shutdown. The U.S. Senate has continued to meet, but the U.S. House of Representatives has not convened in weeks. 
“Congressional Democrats want to fund the government, and we have repeatedly asked Speaker Mike Johnson for over a month to gavel us back into session so that we can continue working on behalf of the American people,” McClellan said. 
Meanwhile, Youngkin said his emergency order was “only necessary because of the shamelessness of Congressional Democrats.”

The political back-and-forth has left Richmond resident Asia Broadie feeling stressed. A single mother of six, she balances a restaurant job with schooling to become a nursing assistant. 
“It’s a constant daily journey. I try to manage it all,” she said as her washing machine hummed in the background of her Northside apartment. Dishes and laundry are just part of the juggling act as Broadie keeps her schedule — and her household — running. 
While The Mercury accompanied Broadie to a store, she pointed to pantry staples — rice, noodles, canned vegetables — along with grab-and-go snacks like granola bars, yogurt and apples for her older children, who cycle in and out of the apartment. Like Garratt, she takes advantage of the Fresh Match program when buying fresh produce such as grapes and lettuce. 
Meats are a key purchase, especially when she prepares large meals so her family can eat leftovers for a few days. 
“I’m trying not to have to go to the store a lot and be cooking and making a mess everyday. I run my dishwasher twice a day sometimes. They’re growing and they’re eating — it goes quick,” she said with a smile and a sigh. 
 Other effects to SNAP on the horizon

More than the shutdown’s impact on her SNAP benefits, Broadie has watched with concern as a reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer could lead to  people receiving less food assistance or losing eligibility altogether. The bill imposes additional verification requirements for recipients.
For his part, Youngkin issued a directive aimed at reducing error rates — the measure of overpayments and underpayments of SNAP benefits. The reconciliation bill stipulates that states with higher error rates will have to pay a portion of SNAP benefits to recipients that the federal government otherwise would otherwise cover. Virginia’s 12% error rate, outlined by Youngkin in the directive, must drop to 6% in the next two years to avoid paying $270 million annually. 
The work is expected to be challenging for local governments, which administer food assistance and may need to rely on their staff to more closely scrutinize expenses and household compositions. 
While Garratt and Broadie support efforts to ensure SNAP operates effectively, they warn against changes that could weaken the program. Broadie worries that stereotypes about recipients as people who “mooch” off the government has made it an easy target for federal funding cuts. 
It’s disheartening, she said, reflecting on her own experience juggling school and work in hopes to one day no longer need SNAP. 
“Also imagine the people who literally cannot work,” she said. “This is going to be hard.”

(JW Caterine for the Virginia Mercury) Virginia’s list of early childhood centers rated as “needing support” has been cut in half from 51 to 25 over back-to-back school years, with instruction identified as the most common aspect requiring improvement.
The state education department identified the data to determine how it can improve and support Virginia’s early childhood care centers and family day homes, as families continue to seek high-quality sites. Seven out of 10 Virginia children under the age of six have working parents, according to the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE).
The state uses the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system (VQB5), which is focused on improving children’s school readiness and expanding access for parents and support providers. The system is also a tool for gauging the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs. 
Jenna Conway, chief of early learning and specialized populations at VDOE, said none of the sites identified as needing support in the 2023-2024 school year repeated the following year. However, the agency still plans to continue helping more sites meet or exceed expectations.
“We want every single actor in the system, every single person, to pay attention to what’s happening in each and every classroom,” Conway said. “That’s why we require observations in the fall and spring in every single classroom, and that’s why our data system captures data about every single classroom and then rolls that up to create the site results.”
Last Thursday at the state Board of Education work session, Conway shared some details from the agency’s second release of the VQB5 ratings of 3,923 sites and new honor rolls, which were presented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and VDOE earlier this month.
Many sites branded as “needing support” also need improved instruction. Between the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, the number of sites “needing support” decreased from 51 to 25. The 25 sites represent only 1% of the total number of sites, with 3,167 (96%) meeting expectations and 101 (3%) exceeding the state’s quality expectations.
Under this measurement, the state focuses on how educators interact with and support children’s learning across different age groups. Conway said this could range from language modeling for infants and toddlers to helping preschoolers ask questions and encouraging critical thinking.
The data is also raising awareness of the state’s VQB5 Quality Profiles portal, which helps families “search for and choose the public or private early childhood option that best meets their needs,” according to the agency. 
Conway said the portal has received 125,000 views as of Thursday afternoon, after collecting approximately 10,000 views in the first 24 hours.
The system was made possible by successful legislation first introduced and carried by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, and former Democratic Sen. Janet Howell in 2020, which was amended in 2022.
The system took another step forward after the General Assembly approved funding the Youngkin administration’s $1.2 billion Building Blocks for Virginia Families initiative, which invests in early childhood slots this biennium.
The state conducted 31,258 local and external site observations during the 2024-2025 school year, supporting over 11,300 classrooms, nearly doubling the previous year.
Agency data from the 2024-2025 school year also shows that 51% of Virginia’s kindergartners are “school ready,” while the remaining 49% began the same year needing to build skills in literacy, mathematics, self-regulation and/or social skills.
In the past two administrations, Virginia has seen substantial growth in publicly funded early childhood care and education programs. Notably, state funding has increased by $390 million since 2018.
Additionally, the number of children served with public funds has nearly doubled, rising from approximately 37,000 to nearly 70,000. The growth has primarily been driven by the Child Care Subsidy Program, which provides subsidies to eligible families, and funding to private, community-based preschools. The initiatives help support children at risk of entering school without the necessary skills.
President Grace Creasey, whom Youngkin appointed, said at Wednesday’s work session she was appreciative of the early learning team and its forward-looking approach to continuous improvement in early childhood education.
She suggested the state should continue investigating salary differences among early childhood providers, focusing on instructional leadership development, exploring ways to support early identification of special education needs, and improving communication between early childhood and K-12 systems.
“I know for your team, this is truly a moment of finality to some degree,” Creasey said. “I know we’re never finished doing this kind of work to make things better, to prepare kids better to get to our K-12 systems, and I just thank all of you for your commitment to moving this continually down the field to get to that goal post that you all set for yourselves and for the commonwealth.” 
Conway said she hopes the data will help address the challenges with teacher turnover, in the short and long term.
According to the data presented, 31% of childcare teachers left day care centers between fall 2024 and spring 2025, compared to 5% of teachers who left public schools.
Conway also hopes the data will encourage families to visit the portal and help them understand why child interactions, or exchanges between a child and a teacher or caregiver, matter for healthy development.
“We hope that not only can we help more parents understand what VQB5 is and why it’s so important, but also that it helps us understand — as parents and grandparents and guardians — how we can ultimately improve our own interactions and support all kids’ learning and development,” Conway said.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Ahead of Election Day, when Virginians will choose a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and House of Delegates members, a group of registrars from around Virginia recently explained how elections work, how they help keep them secure and the inspiration behind their efforts facilitating people’s ability to participate in the democratic process. 
The discussion stemmed from a partnership between the Virginia Mercury and Keep Our Republic, a civic education nonprofit.

Security is paramount, the registrars said, as they broke down how they pre-test voting equipment, create protocols for election worker conduct and access to ballots, and how  they participate in the post-election audits state law requires. 
Though registrars and other workers may appear to have heavier workloads on Election Day and the 45 days of early voting that leads up to it, registrars said the work of maintaining voter rolls is a year-round duty.
“It’s funny, people think we work once every four years for the presidential election,” said Norfolk registrar Stephanie Iles. “We are working every day. We’re not just running the elections, we are handling the voter registration and campaign finance, but we have elections every single year.”
She, along with Richmond registrar David Levine, Henrico County Registrar Mark Coakley, and Virginia Beach Registrar Christine Lewis, explained that they’ve also acted as educators when sharing their insights with state lawmakers regarding ballot box accessibility. 
Another key responsibility is catching voter fraud — something that most often is a voter’s own error, rather than malicious attempt to undermine democracy, they said. 
But the distrust in the system that some politicians and influencers have sown in recent years has made their jobs challenging at times. 
“If somebody you’ve lionized, somebody that you worship, somebody that you respect – perhaps somebody that you voted for — is pushing information that’s incorrect and doing so repeatedly, combating that is a challenge,” Levine said. 
Much of the electoral process distrust and the spread of misinformation about it escalated during and following the 2020 presidential election. That year, President Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden and insisted election fraud was to blame. Recounts in battleground states confirmed Biden’s victory that year, but his assertions culminated in a violent storming of the U.S. Capitol after he spoke at a “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, 2021. 
Numerous lawsuits filed by Trump and allies have been dismissed and Fox News paid millions in a settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, one of several technology companies to file defamation suits. 
Levine said that he thinks it’s “fair to say” that democracy is “under threat.”
“We’re at a critical inflection point,” he said and he added that he stays in the profession so that he can tell his sons years from now how he worked to ensure that everyone’s votes were counted. 
The registrars shared the often unseen, nitty gritty details of how they run their offices — from processing applications, to administering elections, to verifying everything is secure and accurate. 

They wish more voters knew about and understood the layers of security and points of double-checking, they emphasized. In some cases, they’ve invited skeptics to be involved in the work and experience it up close.  
“We’ve taken some of the biggest naysayers, I would say, that have questioned the process or have questioned the security, and we’ve invited them to serve as officers of elections in our polling places to see what goes on behind the scenes,” Iles said. 
As a result the critics have relayed appreciation for the preemptive testing, layers of security during elections, and post-election auditing, she added. 
Additionally, Iles shared that “we always do things in pairs, so no one person is around our equipment at one time. There’s always multiple people.”
And while voter fraud is rare, the different registrars shared instances where they’ve caught it and protocols for how to address it. 
“Most of the time, our voter fraud is not intentional,” Virginia Beach Registrar Lewis said. “It’s usually someone that’s voted early or by mail the first couple weeks, and then on Election Day, they forgot they voted.”
Coakley of Henrico explained that commonly, in areas with concentrations of universities, students that were previously registered where their parents live then try to vote in the locality where they attend college. 
“A student may be registered at home 45 days before an election, and their parents say, ‘go vote,’ and then on election day, a professor will say, ‘look, there’s same-day registration in Virginia,’” Coakley said. “It’s easily caught, and there is no double voting going on with those situations.”
Iles said there was a time her office caught an intentional double-voting attempt where a resident voted locally in Norfolk and absentee in Florida. They were referred to law enforcement for investigation and prosecution. That instance was the exception rather than the rule, as Iles said her office most often catches paperwork mistakes. 
For instance, sometimes people with past felony convictions fail to indicate that status on paperwork — a misrepresentation that is then referred to local commonwealths attorney offices to investigate. In Virginia, people with past felony convictions are unable to vote unless they’ve successfully petitioned the governor to restore their rights. 
The state legislature advanced an attempt to enshrine automatic voting rights restoration into  Virginia’s constitution this year. If it passes again next year, it can appear on ballots statewide for Virginians to approve or reject. If approved, people who have completed their prison sentences would automatically be able to vote again in lieu of petitioning the governor. 
With over 750,000 votes already cast by mid-October, registrars and other election workers will continue to staff early voting locations and process mail-in ballots leading up to Election Day on Nov. 4. Despite long-simmering Republican opposition to early voting nationwide, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has launched advertisement campaigns in recent years to encourage voters to take advantage of all of their voting options. Shortly after early voting began, turnout was high in GOP-strongholds — areas once reluctant to embrace early voting — or “purple” districts, which have been critical to both parties.

The registrars enjoy assisting first-time voters, whether they are naturalized citizens, newly legal adults finally allowed to participate, or those compelled by key issues to cast their first ballot. Coakley said first-time voters serve as a living reminder of why he stays in the election administration industry. 
“(They’re) the best part. If they’re 18 or 83, it does not matter,” Coakley said. “When you see that first-time voter and give them that sticker and everybody has applause, that’s what keeps us coming back each day.”

Gov. and Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears speaks at a rally on June 17, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)Transgender teenagers ages 13 to 17 comprise a scant 3.1% of the youth population in Virginia. But trans issues have loomed unusually large in Virginia’s gubernatorial election this year – and not in a good way. 
From 2014 to early 2025 – when state policy changed to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls’ sports in the public school divisions – just 48 appeals had been filed by transgender athletes to compete in school sports, a Virginia High School League spokesman confirmed to me. That’s a minuscule number of students who participate in sports annually.
On the record: Winsome Earle-Sears

Yet Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears has flogged the issue repeatedly, in a way disproportionate to the number of people affected. The scheme also distracts from more-critical concerns, like soaring food costs, impending health-care changes, and the chaos that has beset the federal government since Donald Trump’s second presidential term started in January. Those issues affect all Virginians.
Earle-Sears’ hateful strategy targets already vulnerable people who seek to be their true selves. She’s employed it to try to defeat Democratic Party nominee Abigail Spanberger in November. The former congresswoman has been more tolerant on transgender topics, and she’s said bathroom use in schools based on gender should be decided at the local level.
CNN reported that last month, Earle-Sears’ campaign spent $2 million on ads focused on transgender policy, more than it spent on any other issue. The news website Notus.org said Republicans in the gubernatorial contest, including her campaign, have dedicated a whopping 57% of all their paid media campaigning toward transgender-related issues, citing data from the company AdImpact.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

The discriminatory crusade demonizes transgender people and their families. Other GOP candidates across the country have followed suit in local, state and federal contests. It suggests how bankrupt their overall messaging is.
For example, state Del. Chad Green, R-York, who’s running for re-election, teamed up with Earle-Sears this month at a campaign stop in Williamsburg. He said barring “biological males” from competing against females was among his top priorities, The Virginian-Pilot reported.
Added Earle-Sears: “All the Democrats want biological men in girls’ sports.”
It’s a lot of umbrage directed at a relatively small population of athletes and individuals. And these Republican candidates know it.
Transgender adults, incidentally, have a prevalence of past-year thoughts about suicide “that is nearly twelve times higher, and a prevalence of past-year suicide attempts that is about eighteen times higher, than the U.S. general population,” according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. They certainly don’t need hyped comments from political leaders.
The Republican tack on transgender people is reprehensible. This cynical blueprint to stoke fear, drive transphobic voters to the polls and exploit ignorance mimics one that Trump used in the 2024 presidential election.
Republicans nationwide, obviously, would rather spew on this topic than debate cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Those reductions occurred because of the president’s bill that took money from the poor to pay for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the rich. Republicans in Congress, who control both chambers, passed the legislation.
Such programs impact millions of people, including folks in the commonwealth. Nearly 2 million Virginians used Medicaid or FAMIS, the state’s health insurance for children, earlier this year. More than 866,000 used SNAP.
Regarding the fixation on trans people, “They’re focusing on this more than issues that affect all Virginians,” Reed Williams told me. The 23-year-old trans woman attended high school in Virginia Beach and is now on the staff of Equality Virginia, a LGBTQ+ advocacy organization.
Williams recently wrote a heartfelt column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch verbalizing her dismay at the attention that conservative candidates place on this issue, when things like the economy and rising prices are much more important. She’s right.
Williams noted, matter-of-factly, that she used the girls’ bathroom from the 8th to 12th grades – one of the overheated talking points for conservatives. Williams had a summer job in City Hall at 16.
Reed Williams, director of digital engagement & narrative strategy at Equality Virginia, told columnist Roger Chelsey ““Virginia’s current fight over transgender people is entirely manufactured.” (Photo courtesy Equality Virginia)
“Confusion over my gender could be remedied with a productive conversation, agreement to disagree, or simply moving on,” she wrote. “Virginia’s current fight over transgender people is entirely manufactured.”
I reached out to a spokesperson for Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, about her focus on trans issues, but Peyton Vogel didn’t respond to my messages. Among them: Has Earle-Sears actually discussed her concerns with transgender individuals, especially those who transitioned during high school?
Besides, it’s not like the topic leads the list of priorities for Virginians. Far from it.
A Virginia Commonwealth University poll in September said that, among the top issues influencing registered voters in the state, 28% named the rising cost of living, followed by women’s reproductive rights (13%) and immigration and education (12%). Similarly, a Washington Post-George Mason University poll this month found just 4% of voters in the commonwealth said policies about transgender students were the most important issue in the governor’s race.
Instead, look at what Virginia is facing:
Because of the ongoing shutdown by the federal government, 900 furloughed federal employees have filed unemployment claims in Virginia during the first two weeks of October.
The Trump administration’s federal job cuts – most of which had little publicly announced criteria – have hurt Virginia; 341,000 federal workers lived here in 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau reported.
The state’s unemployment rate is projected to hit 4.1% by the end of the year, up from 2.9% in 2024, according to the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia.
But sure, Republicans, continue to be transfixed on transgender voters.
It’s not the first time you’ve scapegoated minorities by race or gender. Going back to at least your Willie Horton ads during the 1988 presidential contest between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, you’ve been chock full of stereotyping and fear-mongering.
You simply don’t care who you harm in the process.
May your gutless ploy backfire.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)I saw some of my former Naval War College colleagues at the recent No Kings rally in Providence. Given that National Guard troops and protestors had clashed in Los Angeles at an earlier June rally protesting ICE raids, we wondered whether we would see National Guard troops as we marched, where they would be from, and their mission? We didn’t. That doesn’t mean, however, that there is no need for concern about the future.
The National Guard is unique to the U.S. military given it is under the authority of both state governors and the federal government and has both a domestic and federal mission. Governors can call up the National Guard to help when states have a crisis, either a natural disaster or a human-made one. Federal authorities can call on the National Guard for overseas deployment and to enforce federal law. 
President Dwight Eisenhower used both federalized National Guard units and regular U.S. Army units to enforce desegregation laws in Arkansas in 1957. But using military troops to intimidate citizens and support partisan politics, especially by bringing National Guard units from other states has never been, and should never be, part of its mission.
But that’s what is happening now.
A host of Democratic U.S. senators, led by Dick Durbin of Illinois, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and 25 others has called for an inquiry into the Trump administration’s recent domestic deployment of active-duty and National Guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee. In an Oct. 17 letter to the Defense Department’s Inspector General, the senators challenge the legality of the domestic troop deployment and charge that it undermines military readiness and politicizes the nation’s military. 
Ostensibly, the troops have been sent to cities “overrun” with crime. Yet data shows that has not been the case. Troops have been sent to largely Democratic-run cities in Democratic-led states. 
The case for political theater being the real reason behind the deployment certainly was strengthened when largely Republican Mississippi sent troops to Washington D.C., even though crime in Mississippi cities like Jackson is higher than in D.C. Additionally, there is an even more dangerous purpose to the troop presence  — that of normalizing the idea of troops on the streets, a key facet of authoritarian rule.
There are fundamental differences in training and mission between military troops and civilian law enforcement, with troop presence raising the potential for escalation and excessive force, and the erosion of both civil liberties and military readiness.
Troop deployments have hit some stumbling blocks. Judges, including those appointed by President Donald Trump, have in cases like Portland impeded administration attempts to send troops. Mayors and governors, including Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have pushed back as well. While the Trump administration has shown its willingness to ignore the law, it has also shown a significant ability to come up with a “Plan B.” In this case, Plan B, used by many past dictators, is likely the utilization of private military companies (PMC).










While the Trump administration has shown its willingness to ignore the law, it has also shown a significant ability to come up with a 'Plan B.' In this case, Plan B, used by many past dictators, is likely the utilization of private military companies.


Countries have used these mercenary organizations to advance strategic goals abroad in many instances. Though the Wagner Group, fully funded by the Kremlin, was disbanded after a rebellion against the regular Russian military in 2023, Vladimir Putin continues to use PMCs to advance strategic goals in Ukraine and other regions of the world wrapped in a cloak of plausible deniability. Nigeria has used them internally to fight Boko Haram. The United States used Blackwater in Afghanistan in the early days after 9/11. Overall, the use of PMCs abroad is highly controversial as it involves complex tradeoffs between flexibility, expertise and need with considerable risks to accountability, ethics and long-term stability.
Domestically, the use of PMCs offer leaders facing unrest the advantage of creating and operating in legal “gray zones.” Leaders not confident of the loyalty of a country’s armed forces have resorted to these kinds of private armies. Adolph Hitler relied on his paramilitary storm troopers, or “brown shirts” to create and use violence and intimidation against Jews and perceived political opponents. Similarly, Mussolini’s “black shirts,” Serbian paramilitaries, and PMCs in Gaddafi’s Libya served similar purposes. 
President Trump has said he was “open” to the idea of using PMCs to help deport undocumented immigrants. He has militarized Homeland Security agents to send to Portland, evidencing his willingness to circumvent legal challenges. And perhaps most glaringly, poorly qualified and trained masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are already terrorizing American cities.
At the No Kings rally in Providence my former colleagues and I did see a man in an unfamiliar uniform — with a gun and handcuffs — standing alone on the sidewalk along the march path. He wasn’t doing anything threatening, just watching. In the past, he might not have even been noticed. 
But that day he was, some people even waved to him. Protestors are not yet intimidated, but they are wary, and rightfully so.
Be aware, America. They have a Plan B.

Wes Moore (D) has filed as a federal political action committee. The filing raises provides little insight on who's behind the group, but puts it in company with dozens of other Republican and Libertarian campaigns. (Screenshot of NoMoore.org)A federal campaign filing by NoMoore.org, a group that Democratic Party operatives called “shadowy,” raises more questions than it answers about the group that is using social media to needle the first-term Democratic governor.
The group in August filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission for the NoMoore Political Action Committee, a “hybrid” PAC that can raise unlimited amounts of money for independent expenditures, and limited amounts for candidate donations. But the PAC has yet to report any fundraising activity and its sole listed officer, who also oversees two dozen other conservative PACs out of a Northern Virginia mail drop, did not respond to requests for comment.
NoMoore.org, in an unsigned response to reporter’s questions, insisted its efforts are focused on issue education not electioneering.
“Our organization is focused solely on supporting or opposing policies at the state level and calling out the failures of those in power in Annapolis. Our mission is to fight back against the reckless tax-and-spend policies that are destroying our state,” the organization said in its email.
Rumors persist about the identity of those behind the group. Democrats, including the state party and those who support Moore, insist the group has motivations beyond issue education.
“We love that we are living in the head of Governor Moore and the out-of-touch Maryland Democratic Party,” the group wrote.
Some theorize the virtual jabs are an effort to soften Moore up in anticipation of the 2026 election and a potential head-to-head contest with former Gov. Larry Hogan. The Republican predecessor to Moore is often mentioned as a potential 2026 candidate, and has at times has teased the idea himself, but has not made any public moves that indicate he is running.

Others suggest the NoMoore campaign is meant to strip the shine off Moore, a rising national star in his party and considered a potential candidate for president in 2028. So far, Moore maintains that he is not considering such a run.
A spokesperson for the Moore re-election campaign declined to comment on this story.
Complaints referred to state prosecutor
NoMoore.org gained attention earlier this year with social media posts targeting Maryland’s governor.
In March, the Maryland Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Maryland State Board of Elections, questioning whether NoMoore’s activities violate state election laws. In particular, the party expressed concerns that the group had failed to file as a campaign entity in Maryland.
The party recently criticized the group for what it called racist AI-generated content lampooning the governor. One post drawing specific criticism features Moore in a red clown nose and rainbow wig. An identical theme was used in a post about Carter Elliott, a white Moore spokesperson who recently moved to the governor’s campaign staff.
NoMoore said the Democratic Party was “screaming ‘racism’ and inventing conspiracies” to distract from what it said was Moore’s “record on spending and taxes.”
Allen Norfleet, director of candidacy and campaign finance at the board of elections, said the Democratic Party complaint and an anonymous second, previously unreported, complaint were forwarded to the Office of the State Prosecutor.
Norfleet said forwarding the complaints to the state prosecutor is not an indication of election law violations. “It’s just because they are the investigative agency for the state board,” Norfleet said.
The prosecutor’s office does not acknowledge the existence or status of investigations.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s deeply concerning that the Maryland Democratic Party will do anything and everything in its power to weaponize our judicial system against political opposition,” NoMoore.org said in its unsigned response to questions. “We are following every law and simply exercising our First Amendment rights. Opposing higher taxes is the very basis on which our country was founded.”
A spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party declined to comment.
NoMoore is a federal PAC
NoMoore.org has not registered with the State Board of Elections, but with the FEC instead.
“At this time, we have no intention of being involved in next year’s election,” the group said in its email. “We only began raising money in September and are powered by small-dollar donations and volunteer energy, not special interests. Our goal is simple: to educate, organize, and empower Marylanders who feel left behind.”
The August filing established NoMoore PAC as a hybrid PAC, which can operate with two segregated bank accounts.
One can solicit and accept unlimited contributions. The money can come from individuals, corporations, unions and other political committees. The contributions can be used for independent expenditures, including ads referring to a federal candidate or generic voter drives in federal elections, according to the FEC.
The second bank account — subject to contribution limits — can make donations to individual federal candidates.
NoMoore PAC has yet to report any financial activity. Contributions and expenditures, if any, will become public in future filings, possibly after the first of the year.
The identities of the organizers remain unknown, and the subject of much speculation around the State House. The organization sidestepped questions about who was involved in the group.

“NoMoore.org is a grassroots movement built by and for Marylanders who are deeply concerned about the direction of our state under Wes Moore’s leadership,” the group wrote. “We are everyday citizens who have come together out of shared frustration and a desire for change. Moore’s record of spending, tax hikes, and misplaced priorities compelled us to act.”
Connections to conservative PACs
The statement of organization filed with the federal agency appears to tie the group to a network of national Republican PACs.
It is not clear why the group opted to create a federal campaign entity. Norfleet said the creation of a federal account surprised him.
“I don’t see any interest at the national level based on their activity,” Norfleet said.
The treasurer and bank named in the federal filing — Melodie Johnson and Chain Bridge Bank, respectively — have ties to other PACs backing Republican and Libertarian interests.
Johnson is also treasurer and custodian for at least two dozen other right-leaning political action committees, according to a review of FEC and IRS records. Some of those committees date back over a decade.
On that list are committees supporting Donald Trump, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and groups including FreedomWorks, Change New York – Save America PAC, and the GOPAC Election and GOPAC Education Funds.
A mail drop
The address for many of those federal committees — including NoMoore PAC — is a store front in a McLean, Virginia, shopping center three miles from CIA headquarters. The business offers private mailbox rentals.
Many of the committees overseen by Johnson, including NoMoore PAC, have accounts at Chain Bridge Bank, which was founded by former U.S. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican from Illinois. The online bank has one physical location in McLean, roughly half a mile from the store front that serves as a mailing address for NoMoore PAC and other committees.

The bank has worked with every major Republican presidential candidate since 2008, including Donald Trump, according to Reuters.
A phone number for Johnson, found in FEC filings, is no longer in service. She did not respond to an email requesting an interview.
Norfleet said Johnson did not respond to emails he sent. He did receive an out-of-office vacation message.
Johnson is also listed as the treasurer or custodian of other PACs that operated in Maryland.
Ties to Hogan allies
Some of those organizations employed or were run by political operatives connected to Hogan.
One such committee, a 501(c)(4) called New Path Inc., was engaged in educating the public on new policies that would improve the economy and quality of life, according to IRS records.
The group hired a Pennsylvania-based political consulting firm called Red Maverick Media. Mike Leavitt, a founder and partner at the firm, worked as a consultant to Hogan’s 2014 campaign.
New Path also hired Steve Crim, a senior aide and campaign manager for Hogan, in 2016. Crim was the architect behind Hogan’s Change Maryland effort. The social media juggernaut billed as a grassroots campaign helped propel Hogan into the governor’s mansion in 2014.
Crim was also listed as a contact person for an organization known as Common Sense America Inc., according to IRS records. Johnson was listed as the principal officer using the same McLean address used for NoMoore.org.

NoMoore.org did not respond to questions about Crim’s involvement in the organization.
Crim, in an email, said he was not working for NoMoore.org, but that, “This summer, as a professional courtesy, I connected NoMoore.org to a compliance team that helps organizations navigate the complexities of grassroots advocacy.”
‘No plans to engage in the 2026 election’
Establishment of a federal PAC does not necessarily mean NoMoore.org will not have to register with state elections officials eventually.
Currently the group is walking a line between campaigning and what might be considered protected political speech.
But there are activities that could trigger registration with state elections officials including aggregate donations of $10,000 or aggregate donations of $6,000 or more in an election cycle. Either would require the group to file in Maryland.
That filing under the so-called 48-hour rule would have to include details about spending and donations, donors and the person directing and controlling the activities of the group.
Norfleet said those triggers were provided to NoMoore.org.
“As we have no plans to engage in the 2026 election and are not advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate, registering as a state committee did not make sense,” the group said in its email. “If we ever engage in a Maryland election and reach the required reporting thresholds, we will fully comply.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1814-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 07:17:00.430137

They continue to seek bipartisan support. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Advocates for a ban on plastic bags said they chose to hold off on presenting legislation this session after they could not secure a Republican co-sponsor for what they hope will eventually be a bipartisan bill.
“We just feel like it would be more damaging to advance it and have it turn into a partisan football,” said Susan Richman, an advocate with New Hampshire Network, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group that formed in 2021.
Richman said the group had seen an encouraging bipartisan response to their advocacy on the topic, including from members of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee and the Solid Waste Working Group earlier this year. Ultimately, however, the group did not land on a version of the ban that could attract a Republican co-sponsor ahead of the 2026 session, Richman said.
Bag ban proponents are motivated by environmental, health, and landfill capacity concerns, said Richman and Rep. Nicholas Germana, of Keene.
Of the waste generated in New Hampshire in 2023, 105,770 tons — or 16.6% — was plastic, according to a 2024 report by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. 
“We really need to focus on not needing another landfill for a good long time,” said Germana, who has participated in discussions around possible bag ban legislation. “… The best thing we can do is reduce the amount of waste we are producing.”
Further up the waste stream, the bags also create issues for transfer stations — and, by extension, municipalities, Richman said.
“(Plastic bags) are hugely expensive to get rid of. They can’t be recycled, despite public mythology,” she said. A few companies, like Barrington-based Plastic Recycled, collect plastic bags and other hard-to-recycle plastics and transform them into composite park benches, siding, and other materials. But most plastic bags do not find another purpose; and when they are mistakenly sent through traditional recycling streams, they “gum up the works” when the thin plastic bags get caught in transfer station machinery, according to Richman.
Germana also raised concerns about microplastics. Plastic bags “break down into smaller and smaller pieces, but they don’t go away,” he said. “They end up in our water, our food, and then our bodies.”
Richman said ban proponents were concerned that some plastic grocery bags may contain PFAS, toxic materials known as “forever chemicals” for their ability to persist in the environment and in the body. Researchers have previously detected PFAS, which are linked to illnesses including cancer, in various kinds of plastic food packaging. 
Four of the six New England states — Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont — have enacted statewide bans on single-use plastic bags at most retailers within the last five years. (In Massachusetts, a similar bill passed the Senate in 2024 but did not leave the House. Another version of the bill will go before the Legislature this year.)
Generally, the issue of waste reduction receives bipartisan attention, Germana said. However, Republican legislators resisted the idea of a ban some said could pass on costs to customers. Germana provided the example of stores selling paper bags at the register for a nickel or dime a piece, in lieu of free plastic bags.
Richman said the New Hampshire Network had recorded more than 5,000 signatures on a petition they began in 2024 supporting a retail bag ban. Though no legislation will be officially considered this year, Richman said the network would not drop the issue.
“People do well without (plastic bags),” she said. “It’s just a matter of convention and custom.”
Germana agreed the discussion would continue, though he said the disagreements that had stalled it were exemplary of some of the most fundamental differences between the two parties.
“I think this question about single-use plastic bags really does go deeper, into the role of the government in solving our problems,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bags-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 05:16:31.773600

This order of events is also known as the success sequence and Senate Bill 156 passed with a 24-9 party-line vote. State Sen. Al Cutrona, R-Canfield, introduced the bill which now moves to the Ohio House for consideration.

“We have an obligation to the next generation,” Cutrona said. “We need to help them break the chains of poverty. Now this bill provides just that, creating the opportunity by taking (a) three-pronged approach.”
The bill requires the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce to create a model curriculum for the success sequence for grades 6-12 and this would be a graduation requirement. 
The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that published Project 2025, provides model legislation for the success sequence.
“This, by no means is some golden ticket to the rich heels,” Cutrona said. “This is an opportunity — one thing that we can do that can help break those chains of poverty.”
Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, said this bill will help break Ohio’s cycle of poverty. 
“We’ve got an obligation to try to break that poverty cycle by giving these kids positive intervention that will help them want to improve their lives and grow,” he said. “And if we don’t do it, we’re going to continue to see the same old thing over and over again.” 
Following these sequences of events means people are “overwhelmingly less likely to live in poverty in adulthood,” according to the bill. 
However, a 2021 study funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found those who finish high school, work full time, and get married are less likely to experience poverty, but the order did not matter much. 
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, said this bill might be the least effective policy solution to combat poverty. 
“If we were serious about fighting poverty and being a help to Ohio’s working poor, we could be providing paycheck protections or working family support,” he said. “Poverty is not a failure of personal responsibility, it is a failure of public policy priorities. And in that respect, Senate Bill 156 will not change poverty in Ohio for those who need it the most.”
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said the bill leaves out the lived experiences of many families in Ohio. 
“This bill promotes certain values that don’t reflect the experiences of many Ohio families,” she said. “… It tells kids there’s only one way to have that successful family structure that’s not unconventional.”
Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said he is perplexed by opposition to the bill.
“We have been throwing money at the war on poverty, and where has it gotten us?” he said. “Not very far. We need better life decisions to be made. We’re not dictating people how to live their lives. We’re making suggestions.”
Tennessee passed a similar success sequence bill earlier this year and Utah enacted a similar law last year. Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas all had similar bills this year as well.

(Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)In U.S. cities big and small, mayors are finding their tenures shaped by housing shortages, and efforts to build more homes, so that people of any income can afford a place to live.
In a series of conversations, mayors of big cities such as Atlanta and Seattle, as well as of midsize Midwest cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Madison, Wisconsin, told Stateline that housing is the No. 1 priority for mayors to tackle.
“Housing is by far one of the most important issues facing every mayor in America. It impacts everything from safety to the workforce to transit,” said Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, who also is the immediate past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. “Mayors are on the front lines of our nation’s housing crisis. And it is a crisis.”
More than half of mayors in a recent bipartisan survey expect affordability in their cities to decline over the next year, and nearly all say their residents are dissatisfied with current housing costs. The survey was released in June by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, along with the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Capital One Insights Center.
And while a large share of big-city mayors are Democratic, members of both parties are seeking some nonpartisan solutions. Republican Mark Shepherd of Clearfield, Utah, and Democrat Rex Richardson of Long Beach, California, are pressing Congress to expand rental assistance and affordable housing programs, while also partnering with business leaders to boost supply. The two mayors help lead a coalition called Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment.
Housing is a pivotal issue in next month’s mayoral races in Minneapolis, New York City and Seattle.
But even as mayors set ambitious targets, they’re often working within narrow lanes of authority. While city halls can zone land, streamline permits and invest local dollars, they can’t override state preemption laws or control climbing construction costs and interest rates. In many municipalities, the success and reach of a mayor’s housing vision hinges as much on what state lawmakers allow as on what local voters demand.
At least 30 states have barred cities from enacting rent control. Other factors not related to the push-and-pull of home rule between state and local governments cap how much mayors can influence housing within their borders.
“You have to analyze what you can control and what you can’t,” Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said. “Interest rates, tariffs, the cost of materials — those are conditions we can’t fix. What we can do is plan smarter, permit faster and fund what’s within our reach.”

A fast-growing metro area
Ginther, the Columbus mayor, could talk about housing all day. He told Stateline he can’t imagine a mayor in the country who doesn’t have housing consistently on their minds.
As Columbus grapples with record growth and rising housing costs, Ginther says the city’s biggest challenge isn’t political will, it’s scale. Columbus needs 200,000 more housing units in the next 10 years to help bring down the cost of rents and ownership, he said.
Ginther, who is serving his second term, recently proposed creating a Division of Housing Stability. He said that mayors need to use the talent in their offices and agencies to tackle different aspects of the housing crisis, from helping residents find an affordable home to enabling them to keep it.
He’s also said that city voters’ willingness to approve big-dollar bond issues is a “buy-in” that many cities would be fortunate to have.
Since 2019, the city has used $250 million in bonds to build about 4,000 rental units. Voters are being asked to support another $500 million housing bond this November, along with other bonds for parks, police and fire, and road paving. More than half the city’s residents are renters.
Ginther said it’s a part of a $1.9 billion infrastructure package — combining city, county, state, federal and private resources — to reach the 200,000-unit goal.
“It’s ambitious, but if we commit to housing the way we’ve committed to jobs and workforce development, we’ll get it done.”
Can states, and a little bit of faith, convert church land into affordable housing?

According to census data, the Columbus metropolitan area ranks among the fastest-growing U.S. metros. Meanwhile, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency reports that from 2016 to 2021, the state saw a 38% decline in vacant units available for sale or rent, and during the same period saw a 13% increase in units classified for seasonal, recreational or occasional use, such as short-term rentals.
“The city has created jobs and we have one of the fastest-growing economies in the Midwest, but we didn’t build enough housing in previous years to keep up with that. And we have been only doing it a certain way,” said Ginther.
He added that the scale of housing issues is bigger than any one jurisdiction.
“We need regional and state partners to step up, too,” Ginther said. “I’ve said I’ll do half the [Franklin County] region’s housing needs … but I need my suburban and exurban neighbors to do their part.”
The squeeze in small cities
In northern Utah’s Davis County, Clearfield is proudly the home of Hill Air Force Base. Since the 1940s, a large share of military air force personnel have worked and lived nearby.
But Shepherd, the mayor, says his city — with about 32,000 people and once the blue-collar “starter home capital” — has transformed into a market that military families can no longer afford.
“It’s scary,” Shepherd, a Republican who was elected in 2013, told Stateline. “We used to be where people came for their first homes. Now, four airmen are splitting a two-bedroom apartment.”
Despite limited land, Clearfield has permitted or built 4,000 homes in five years, many through denser, vertical development. Shepherd, a longtime real estate agent, is pushing for Utah to expand condominium construction and creative financing tools, including through a new $300 million state loan program.
“Everybody wants ownership,” he said. “If someone wants to buy, we have an obligation to help make that happen.”
But he’s frank about the political headwinds: resistance to density, neighboring cities blocking townhome projects, and a state legislature eager to preempt local control.
“Density is a swear word for elected officials,” Shepherd said. “Some cities just won’t build, and when the carrot doesn’t work, sometimes you have to bring out the stick.”
Lower interest rates, higher incomes made homes more affordable in June

Shepherd said housing challenges are a constant topic among his peers across the country, especially in communities tied to military installations. As a member of the National League of Cities’ Military Communities Council, he regularly exchanges ideas with other mayors facing similar shortages.
“I haven’t had one mayor of a military city tell me they’re totally fine with housing,” he said. “Everywhere, it’s the same story. … The demand is high, the supply is tight, and servicemembers are getting priced out.”
Pressure from outside city borders
In Atlanta, one of the economic and cultural hubs of the South, Mayor Andre Dickens has seen the city get some good headlines in its efforts to address housing issues.
According to Realtor.com’s August 2025 rental report, the median asking rent in metro Atlanta dropped 13.6% year-over-year, one of the largest declines among the 50 biggest U.S. metros, tied with Las Vegas. Dickens credits the trend to an intentional surge in housing production.
In just under four years, Dickens has reached 60% of his goal to build or preserve 20,000 units of lower-cost housing by 2030, he said. Since taking office, he said that 12,000 units are already built or underway, aided by an Affordable Housing Strike Force that meets monthly to fast-track permits and secure funding for those projects.
“Atlanta was seen as affordable compared to New York or California, but our incomes weren’t keeping up,” Dickens told Stateline. His approach, in addition to approving a boost in city workers’ pay last year, was to help create more housing. “We made it our mission to build for low- and moderate-income families and to stop people from being rent-burdened.”
Among the projects Dickens touted to Stateline was the Atlanta Beltline, an urban redevelopment along 22 miles of rail line that delivered 569 affordable housing units last year — almost double its annual goal. The aim is 5,600 units in the area by 2030. Funding often combines public and private sources, and Dickens said that as the mayor, it’s his responsibility to bring these groups to the table.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

He also noted that the city is dealing with an influx of residents both from Atlanta’s suburbs and from cities that have their own housing challenges, such as Chicago, New Orleans and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
“Some suburban or rural counties don’t invest in homelessness or affordability, so those residents eventually land in cities,” said Dickens, who also is a co-chair of the National Housing Crisis Task Force, a coalition of elected officials.
“We can’t push them away,” he said. “We just have to deal with it, because cities are where people come for hope and help. That’s why mayors must lead with compassion and strategy.”
Kitchen-table terms
In Wisconsin, Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway told Stateline that the capital city’s housing challenge is simple but daunting:
“We were not building enough housing to keep up with our population growth,” said Rhodes-Conway, who was elected in 2019. “We built ourselves into a problem.”
Madison is Wisconsin’s fastest-growing city, but housing supply lagged far behind. When Rhodes-Conway took office in 2019, the city’s rental vacancy rate hovered around 1-2%, she said, far below the healthy 5-6% range.
Since then, Rhodes-Conway and the City Council have opened new funding channels and loosened zoning rules to speed construction. The city’s Affordable Housing Fund, once focused solely on federally funded Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects, now includes money for co-ops, community land trusts and homeownership efforts, she said.
“It was important to invite folks to think creatively about how we create affordability,” she said.
Her administration also works to preserve existing affordable stock through the Efficiency Navigator program, which upgrades older apartments for energy efficiency in exchange for rent-stability commitments. On the regulatory side, Madison has updated its zoning code to clear “pain points” such as density limits and onerous approval processes that once stalled projects, she said.











Talking about your neighbor or your kid who can’t find an apartment, that’s real life.


– Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison, Wis.



The results are tangible, as the city has completed more than 17,000 new homes since 2015, with another 5,000 under construction. Under a regional plan, Madison aims to add 15,000 more between 2025 and 2030, aligning with Dane County’s housing goals.
Rhodes-Conway sees the role of a housing-focused mayor to be both a policymaker and a translator.
Mayors need to discuss housing not in zoning jargon, she said, but in kitchen-table terms: stories about parents who can’t afford to buy where they grew up, the seniors priced out of longtime homes, or workers enduring farther commutes for a reasonable, cost-efficient living situation.
“Talking about NIMBYs and AMIs [area median incomes] doesn’t help,” she said. “Talking about your neighbor or your kid who can’t find an apartment, that’s real life.”
Personal experience
Harrell, the Seattle mayor, says he’s trying to turn one of America’s priciest markets into a working model of coordinated, city-level housing governance. When Harrell took office in 2022, he declared himself a “housing mayor.” Seattle’s population growth and its million-dollar home prices demanded more than a single department could manage, he said.
“I realized a city as large as Seattle had a fragmented housing policy,” Harrell said. “So we created a housing subcabinet — every department that touches housing now rows in the same direction.”
And when the state government does make changes to housing or zoning laws, that’s when mayors need to strike, he said.
In 2023, for example, Washington state allowed for the building of duplexes, triplexes and other forms of “middle housing” on land formerly zoned only for single-family homes. Seattle immediately adopted the change.
Harrell shepherded a $970 million property tax levy approved by voters in 2023 to help pay for affordable housing. The city’s new 20-year housing plan increases zoning capacity to allow for 330,000 new housing units, roughly double the target of the city’s previous plan. His administration has also accelerated permitting, which he said has “sped up some projects by one to two years.”
For Harrell, who hopes to win a second term in November, changing affordability in the city harks back to his parents’ first home in Seattle.
“The first house my mom and dad bought here in Seattle is still there,” Harrell said. “Same condition, same footprint. … It hasn’t had an addition. They bought it for $6,000 and sold it for $30,000. That same modest house today is worth over a million dollars.”
He then drew a parallel to his own experience buying a starter home in the 1980s.
“The first house I bought, I was making less than $40,000 a year, and I bought it for $87,000 with my college roommate, at about twice our income,” he said. “That house, too, is worth about a million now. I should’ve held onto it.”
These two homes capture the scale of the affordability crisis, he said.
“That’s the context we’re operating in,” he said. “And if I’m asking people who are already struggling with rent or mortgages to pay more into affordable housing through a levy, I have to be the evangelist. I have to show that we’re putting our own skin in the game.”

""Sloppy"" Floyd State Park and other Georgia parks could be getting a little pricier to visit. Photo by Jill WilliamsThe next time you want to take in some of Georgia’s natural beauty at one of its state parks, it could cost you a little more.
Or at least it will if the Board of Natural Resources signs off Tuesday on a proposal to raise fees. Under the plan under consideration, the cost to park at Georgia’s state parks for a day would double.
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources’ State Parks and Historic Sites Division spent just over $109 million in the 12 months preceding July 1, according to a new report from the state Department of Audits and Accounts, about half of which – $55.5 million – came from self-generated revenue sources like park passes, campsite rentals, golf course fees and gift shop sales.
State funds and bonds pay for about 43% of the division’s expenses, or about $46 million, and the federal government chipped in about $7 million, good for around 7%.
The auditors called the self-generated portion of the division’s revenue “significant.”
“However, we noted additional revenue-generating opportunities related to price adjustments, marketing, and targeted future investments,” the report reads. “Generating revenue to staff and maintain parks must be balanced with ensuring Georgians can access these public resources.”
In all, the auditors came up with more than two dozen recommendations dealing with topics from planning and maintenance to marketing and pricing.
In response to a request for comment, State Parks and Historic Sites Division Chief of Finance Katherine Darsey said the department “recently received the report and will be reviewing its findings and suggestions in the coming weeks.”
You can read the full report here.
Vehicle entry passes
The price to park your car at a state park has been unchanged since 2009 – $5 for a day or $50 for an annual pass, and the auditors found that among southeastern states that charge for park access, Georgia’s fees are the lowest. The report found that Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee do not charge for daily or annual passes, and Tennessee does not charge for the majority of its state parks.
The state Board of Natural Resources is set to meet Tuesday and vote on increasing next year’s fees to $10 for one visit or $70 for a year, according to the proposed amendments to the existing rules. Using 2024 visitation numbers, auditors found a $10 fee could increase revenue by $3.7 million.
Under the proposed changes, groups like senior citizens and disabled veterans who receive discounted rates would see price increases as well, though they would still pay less than the general population.
The auditors also called on the division to push for visitors to opt for annual passes since they bring in more money and drive down the number of potential daily noncompliers.
They note that some states offer discounted annual park passes along with vehicle tag renewal. In one such program in Michigan, 38% of the population purchased discounted passes, generating $42 million.
The auditors found that if owners of 10% of Georgia’s 8.5 million registered vehicles opted for a $20 discounted park pass, state parks could see a $15.8 million revenue bump.
The DNR parks division expressed concerns with the vehicle registration plan, noting fears that such a program could reduce revenues from the state’s license plate program, which allows people to buy a specialty plate and fund conservation efforts.
Reaction
Georgia Rivers Executive Director Rena Peck said bringing Georgia parks’ prices more in line with neighboring states makes financial sense and will help fund the work needed to keep facilities attractive and bring in more customers.
“I think it’s a good plan,” she said. “You’ve got to upkeep these places so that people can come, and then it’s a good, positive cycle with outdoor recreation because those state parks and historic sites, most of their budget comes from income from outdoor recreation. So, you’ve got to keep the facilities up in order to keep the stream of money in order to maintain them for people and nature.”
But Sierra Club legislative chair Mark Woodall said it doesn’t make sense for the state to increase prices at all when it is in a strong fiscal position.
“The state parks of Georgia should be for all the people of Georgia, regardless of income. With over $14 billion in reserve, it would be outrageous for the state parks to increase fees,” he said.
“In these difficult times, we ought to be encouraging people to get outdoors, not making it harder,” he added.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The installation of Ten Commandments posters on the University of Arkansas’ Fayetteville campus has led to the revocation of scholarships and discussions about the constitutionality of the displays. 
Earlier this month, university officials announced they would hang 500 Ten Commandments posters donated by Christian organization Counteract USA to comply with a new state law that requires “a historical representation” of the tenets be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to Act 573 of 2025, posters must be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.

As a “very strong believer of separation of church and state,” UA alum Andy Kinslow said he was angry to learn about the posters. Kinslow, who grew up in Arkansas but now calls Oklahoma home, said he was already contemplating ending his financial support of the university after being told one of his scholarships that referenced diversity needed to be modified to comply with state and federal law. 
Learning about the Ten Commandments posters “was the tipping point” that made him decide to pull both of his scholarships from the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design and remove the department from his will.
“Why would I give money to an institution that is not fighting this law when there are lots of other places that the money could go that would be appreciated,” Kinslow said. 
A federal judge blocked implementation of Act 573 at a handful of Arkansas public school districts in a lawsuit focused on K-12 schools, but a suit challenging implementation of the statute at the higher ed level has not been filed. 
Kinslow said the law, which feels like “someone trying to impose their belief system on everyone else,” represents “religious overstep into public institutions that should be there to serve everyone and not just their interests.” 
“I’m very proud to have gone to the University of Arkansas, but I’m really saddened that this is happening,” he said.

University officials began hanging up the posters the week of Oct. 13, according to UA spokesperson John Thomas. Several dozen have been hung in multiple buildings, and installation is expected to continue throughout the fall semester, Thomas said. Campus leaders, building executives and the university’s primary communications directors have been briefed and notified about the installations.
“The posters are considered state property, therefore any tampering or removal will be investigated,” he said. “Responsible parties could face criminal charges, employment-related discipline, and/or other charges under the Code of Student Life.”
While there have been no formal speaking events expressing opposition, Thomas said he understands the posters have generated conversation.
“Certainly, we are aware and respect the fact that some students and employees disagree with the required postings…While we understand that there are different opinions about Act 573, the university’s practice is to comply with the law.”
Nathan Gray (Courtesy photo)
Supporters of Act 573 have argued the Ten Commandments are a historical document because they influenced the nation’s founders and their creation of the country’s legal system. Opponents, like UA junior Nathan Gray, argue the posters are unconstitutional.
After the Ten Commandments began appearing at the university this month, Gray hung his own flyers around campus that drew attention to Stone v. Graham, a court case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment (which forbids the government from “establishing” a religion) because it lacked a nonreligious, legislative purpose.
Proponents of Act 573 have pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in Kennedy v. Bremerton that instructed the Establishment Clause to be interpreted by “reference to historical practices and understandings.” 
Gray disagreed that the tenets have historical precedence.
“It’s purely religious, and I think that if they really felt that it was a historical document then we would have something like the Bill of Rights placed up or even the Constitution,” Gray said. “… their argument is that this is a document that’s influenced the documents like the Bill of Rights, so I think we could just skip right to our rights and how about we place those up in every classroom?” 
Gray thought it was “a joke” when he first saw a local news report about the donated posters and was “really shocked” they were installed so quickly. After hearing concerns from other campus community members, Gray said he realized no one was taking action and decided to organize himself.

The Fayetteville native hung posters gauging interest in a teach-in, an informal lecture to discuss all sides of the issue. Over the last week, he’s received feedback from more than two dozen graduate and undergraduate students, including a few who are willing to speak. Gray hopes to include faculty members in the lecture, which he intends to host before Thanksgiving break. 
In-person discussions can be fruitful for developing solutions to issues, according to Gray, who noted it’s easy for his peers to focus on virtual actions like signing an online petition.
“Those are really important, but I think getting together in person is a really powerful way of sending a message that we can organize together, and the power really is with the students here and the people,” he said. “And that’s our main way of being able to show it, is just organizing together in a big room.”
While some classmates may assume the debate over the posters is a religious issue that doesn’t affect them, Gray said it’s bigger than that. It’s a question of constitutional rights.
“I think they’re testing the waters and seeing what’s the easiest part of the First Amendment to start to chip away at,” he said. “This unfortunately is it and it has to do with religion, so I think that’s where we are at.”
Gray said Act 573 proponents are taking advantage of a “really chaotic moment” in the country with the government shutdown and a busy news cycle that forces students to move on to the next issue instead of continuing to focus on one thing. Immediate action against the Ten Commandments posters will likely require judicial intervention, Gray said, but in the long term, he hopes creating dialogue around this issue will encourage voters to consider their options for the 2026 election. 
“To make sure that we’re all voting for people who really want to prioritize our constitutional values, and I think that right now people just aren’t aware of a lot of this stuff, especially students,” he said.

Many economists predicted that they would raise costs and prices, and that seemed to be confirmed by two reports produced recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
The bank is one of 12 in the United States, and its region includes all of Ohio and adjacent parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. 
Eight times a year, it conducts surveys of business and community leaders. It uses them to inform its contributions to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policies regarding the money supply and interest rates.
The results of the survey conducted between Sept. 18 and 25 were released last week. 
A tariff is a tax on imports. Trump has said his strategy is to use them to bring back jobs that have fled the country since the free-trade agreements of the 1990s and the 2000s. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBut so far, tariffs appear to have significantly increased companies’ input costs and customers’ prices — and given most employers an incentive to replace people with machines.
“Respondents said their firms’ nonlabor costs had risen by an average of 6.8% over the past 12 months,” the report said. “Roughly two-thirds indicated that they had raised prices to offset some portion of these higher costs, and more than half noted adopting new technologies or increasing automation to reduce overall nonlabor operating expenses. Respondents reported that their firms’ selling prices had risen by an average of 3.3% over the past 12 months, and they expected greater price growth in the 12 months ahead.”
Trump’s unpredictable imposition and de-imposition of tariffs also might be taking a toll. In August, a panel of economists who study various aspects of the economy said that lack of predictability made it difficult for businesses to plan when and how to invest.
In a second report called the Beige Book, the Cleveland Fed last week said that uncertainty contributed to declines in business for manufacturers.
“Manufacturers reported modest declines in demand for goods, a situation which they attributed to tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty, and consumer spending declined slightly,” it said. “On balance, contacts said that their employment levels increased slightly and that wage pressures grew modestly. Nonlabor cost pressures remained robust, and selling prices continued to grow modestly.”
The Beige Book said the tariffs were increasing costs across a wide swath of the economy.
“Overall, nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing the trend seen in the prior three reporting periods,” it said. “Tariffs were frequently cited as drivers of these cost increases across industries. Many manufacturers reported tariff-related cost increases on raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs. Retail contacts noted tariff-driven cost increases on vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate. Two contacts noted that foreign producers were factoring in tariffs and cutting prices accordingly to retain market share.”
It added that consumer spending, a vital economic driver, is also down somewhat. 
“Consumer spending declined slightly in recent weeks, and contacts expected demand to be flat in the coming months,” the Beige Book said. “Several retail stores reported a drop in unit sales, and a large retailer reported lower in-store and online traffic. Similarly, a food and hospitality contact said that customers were ‘more value aware,’ and another large retailer reported that tariff concerns continued to drag down customer sentiment.” 
When it comes to tourism, Trump’s pugnacious attitude toward our neighbors might not be helping.
“One tourism contact, who reported a year-over-year decline in activity, said that visits by Canadians fell by 50%,” the Cleveland Fed reported. “Auto dealers generally reported that sales were flat to down, except for used car sales, which one dealership expected to remain strong in the coming months.”

This comes as lawmakers are passing bipartisan relief bills.
It’s reached a boiling point for Beth Blackmarr, a Lakewood resident fed up with rising property taxes.
“My house payment is going to be going up to $120 a month,” Blackmarr said. “It’s crazy. That puts a stress on us.”
She has been begging state lawmakers to provide some relief — and she isn’t the only one. She is part of Citizens for Property Tax Reform, a grassroots organization based in Cuyahoga County.
“Something is wrong and what’s wrong is that the legislature did not do their job,” she said. “Legislature, get moving!”
The state lawmakers say they are trying.
“The changes we made today will save $2.4 billion over the next three years for our taxpayers in Ohio,” state Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield, said in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
Roemer and the Republican leadership cheered two bipartisan bills that passed this week.
Both House Bill 186 and House Bill 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation.
Read more in-depth about each proposal on News 5’s media partner Ohio Capital Journal.
State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, explained that not everyone will get relief, but this is a step in the right direction.
“It will vary district to district,” Thomas said. “But those that saw the most spikes will then see the most benefit.”
Blackmarr isn’t impressed, laughing at the legislators’ efforts.
“It’s probably about 20 years too late for some of this,” she said.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, knows this and acknowledged the sudden urgency to pass property tax relief bills after years of inaction.
“I have to say that the threat of a ballot initiative is part of the thing that’s driving this,” Huffman said.
Blackmarr is leading the movement to abolish property taxes in the state, collecting signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
“We’ll tell you that — well in excess of 100,000,” Blackmarr said when asked how many signatures the campaign has collected.


To get a proposal on the ballot, amendments need to receive about 415,000 valid signatures.
She said they don’t have any backers or money, and aren’t affiliated with any political action committees — it’s all volunteer work.
Lawmakers warn that the initiative could bankrupt local governments. Blackmarr pushed back, saying they better do something to appease homeowners, then.
“They need to compete with this ballot initiative,” Blackmarr said.
When asked how legislators could earn her support, she wasn’t sure.
“I don’t know that they’d earn my support,” she replied. “They need to do something drastic.”
At this point, she said, the campaign is not standing down.

(Photo by Evan Popp/ Maine Morning Star)Maine has always allowed people to vote in prison, as one of two states that never passed legislation to remove that right from citizens convicted of felonies. 
 
Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	But a new report and a referendum on the upcoming November ballot underscore that the ability of incarcerated Mainers to exercise that right is largely dependent on voluntary work — the goodwill of government officials, some of whose jobs are not supposed to be administering elections, and civil rights groups willing to assist. 
Addressing the barriers within the state’s prison voting system is ever more pressing as President Donald Trump’s administration challenges voting rights through executive orders and other pressure on states, including sweeping requests for personal voter information that current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows has twice denied. There has also been an increase in the number of new restrictive voting laws passed by state governments. 
Maine is now considering added restrictions. 
Mainers will decide on Nov. 4 whether to pass a referendum that would make numerous changes to election procedures — including requiring identification at the polls and adding restrictions to absentee voting. Proponents say doing so will increase election security, while opponents say it will lead to voter suppression. 
The referendum doesn’t explicitly mention incarcerated voting, but legal experts, civil rights advocates and incarcerated people caution that the changes could result in added barriers, on top of already existing ones, for people to vote in prison — who rely entirely on the absentee process and have limited access to identification. 
“Any kind of restrictions or reduction of the ability to vote by absentee ballot is worrisome to us because it disenfranchises folks that we have decided have the ability to vote in our state,” said Joseph Jackson, executive director of Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. “All of us have a stake in where our government goes.”
Because incarcerated people are under the government’s control and care, whatever is happening politically can also impact them in an even more direct way than people on the outside, said Bruce King, executive director of Maine Boys to Men who is a board member for Maine’s Juvenile Justice Advisory Group.
Incarcerated people partner with state officials to encourage voter turnout in prisons

Voting is also one of few ways people in prison can still have a say in what’s happening in their hometown or where their family lives, said King, who was incarcerated himself during his late 20s. 
“I think part of the challenge is that a lot of people in prison don’t feel like they are up to date enough to vote, but the ones that are tend to have a much stronger tie to their communities,” King said, “and when they get out, mainstreaming is less of a challenge.”
How voting in prison works 
The only way to vote while incarcerated in Maine is by absentee ballot. Voting machines and ballot boxes are not brought into prisons or jails. 
Voting in Maine is tied back to a person’s municipality, so incarcerated voters are registered using their last residence, not the prison address. 
To register, residents have to fill out a registration form and a proof of residency/ identification form, which must be notarized. (Maine currently requires voters to provide proof of identification to register to vote but not when casting a ballot.) 
Those are reviewed by their municipality and incarcerated voters can then request an absentee ballot. They’ll fill it out once it gets to them via mail in their facility and return it again by mail. 
While this may seem straightforward, in practice it is not.
Delays with prison mail, limited access to paperwork needed to vote, and limited capacity and training of corrections staff — whose primary roles are supervision and care — to assist with the multi-step process to vote absentee are just some of the barriers to incarcerated voting that currently exist, according to the latest report of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit advocating for humane responses to crime. 
“Everything in prison is 100 times harder than it is on the streets,” a staff member of the Maine Department of Corrections told the researchers. 










Any kind of restrictions or reduction of the ability to vote by absentee ballot is worrisome to us because it disenfranchises folks that we have decided have the ability to vote in our state.

The voluntary apparatus holding up incarcerated voting 
The Sentencing Project report also revealed that the ability to break through those barriers is heavily dependent on voluntary work, notably the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) prison branch founded by incarcerated residents in the early 2000s and located within Maine State Prison. 
The prison branch has run in-person voter registration drives since 2004 and also organizes educational opportunities, such as bringing in candidates to help with another barrier to voting: a lack of knowledge of candidates and issues. 
During a recent webinar about the report, president of the Maine State Prison chapter of the NAACP Foster Bates said they plan to invite all of the candidates for governor in 2026 into Maine State Prison, with the hope — if enough are willing and if the chapter can get approval from the governor — to host a debate or town hall meeting for incarcerated residents. 
In 2006, the Department of the Secretary of State started working with the NAACP to run voter registration and absentee ballot application events within state correctional facilities, providing a way to address discrepancies on voter registration forms or ballot requests in real time while collecting  ballot applications in-person, though not absentee ballots themselves. 
These typically occur every two years before presidential and gubernatorial races and vary from including all facilities to only the larger ones, according to the Department of the Secretary of State.  
But, the Department of Corrections is the gatekeeper to “if and how” this voting work unfolds, including which entities have access to incarcerated residents, the report found.
“I cannot stress enough that if the Department of Corrections does not buy in, voting registration in Maine for those who are incarcerated would be absolutely difficult,” Bates said.

Kristen Budd, one of the report authors, told Maine Morning Star that turnover among those driving this effort is guaranteed — in the Department of Corrections, Secretary of State and incarcerated residents who assist from inside who could get transferred or released.  
Unlike Vermont, the other state where those in prison retain the right to vote, Maine doesn’t have a written policy for prison staff on how to guide incarcerated residents to exercise their voting rights. The report recommends Maine create one. 
“There has to be built in institutional knowledge so that part does not get lost in the day to day,” Budd said. 
The overarching recommendation of the report is to implement on-site polling locations in all prisons and jails where there are eligible voters. Jails present even greater challenges to voting access because of their fluid populations. But even so, turnout in jails with on-site polling locations has surpassed citywide turnout rates in some places, including in Washington, DC, which restored voting rights in prison in 2020. 
Maine’s Secretary of State Department has said doing so would prove difficult here, where elections are run by municipalities. But Budd doesn’t see that as a dead end. She said, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way, right?” 
Voter turnout of people who are incarcerated lags far behind Maine’s overall engagement in elections.
Neither the Maine Department of Corrections nor the Maine Department of the Secretary of State track the number of people in prison who vote in each election. However, a 2020 report from researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated that around 6% of incarcerated people in Maine likely voted in the 2018 election, compared with more than 60% of all eligible Mainers who voted.  
With such low participation already, civil rights advocates and those who are currently and formerly incarcerated worry adding more voting restrictions will effectively prevent even that small subset of the incarcerated population from exercising the right altogether. 
Implications of Question 1 
People who are incarcerated are not allowed to keep documents such as driver’s licenses in their possession, according to Maine Department of Corrections policy. This presents an obvious barrier to adhering to the referendum’s proposal to require identification at the time of voting. 
Bates described the referendum as an effort to try to circumvent the Maine Constitution, which states that every U.S. citizen residing in the state of Maine who is at least 18 years old has a right to vote.

For those outside of prison, the referendum would require showing a valid form of photo ID at the polls: a Maine driver’s license, non-driver identification card, interim identification card, U.S. passport, passport card, or military or veteran identification card. When voting absentee, voters would have to return their ballots along with an “identification envelope” that includes their driver’s license or nondriver identification card number and other personal information.
Maine Department of Corrections stores identification if a person has it on them when admitted and case managers can access it if needed, according to spokesperson Jill O’Brien. While someone is incarcerated, they’re issued a facility identification card, which wouldn’t be considered a valid form of ID to use for voting purposes under the proposed referendum. 
Alex Titcomb, the lead petitioner of the ballot question committee, said he wasn’t aware that incarcerated people lose possession of their IDs while serving their time, but he said Question 1 doesn’t impact them any differently than anyone else who may not currently have a valid photo ID. 
“The burden is upon the Secretary of State to provide a non-driver photo ID, or adjust rulemaking, so that they can continue to cast their ballot,” Titcomb said, referring to a section of the referendum that would also direct the secretary to establish a procedure to issue free, non-driver IDs.  
Presumably, incarcerated residents would still not be permitted to have that identification in their possession. Alicia Rea, a policy fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said that would mean a new process would likely have to be developed to give incarcerated residents temporary access to those cards to be able to provide the needed information to vote. 
“We’re really placing a great deal of dependency on DOCs cooperation for a process that really isn’t DOC’s process,” Rea said. “It’s a constitutional right for them to cast their vote, but we’re saying, ‘Okay DOC has to administer this in some way.’”
There could also be implications for those recently released from prison. 
The Bureau of Motor Vehicles, which is run by the secretary of state, currently has an agreement with the Department of Corrections to produce state IDs for incarcerated residents approaching release from one facility, the Maine Correctional Center in Windham. According to Department of Correction’s policy, case managers are supposed to verify that inmates have at least two forms of ID for employment purposes and help those who don’t leading up to release. 
“Nothing when you’re incarcerated is instantaneous,” said Jackson from Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. “It takes a bit to get easy things done, so something like that, it’s something that’s possible, but it does take a little while to accomplish.”
King from Maine Boys to Men previously worked as a counselor for people with barriers to employment and said much of his time was spent helping people track down documentation, such as security cards and birth certificates, needed to obtain identification.
People serving time often have limited access to the paperwork needed to obtain identification, he said, not only because they’re currently incarcerated but also because a lot of transient people end up behind bars. 
Other potential barriers could come from the changes proposed to the absentee ballot process. 
For example, the referendum would remove some ways absentee ballots can be requested, including by telephone and by an immediate family member on behalf of a voter. This narrows incarcerated people’s options for requesting ballots. 
Both Bellows and Jill O’Brien, director of government affairs for the Department of Corrections, said the two departments would work together to determine the appropriate course of action if Question 1 passes, noting that they already collaborate on the in-person registration and absentee ballot drives. 
However, Bellows said in an interview that she believes “the constraints contained in Question 1 will make the right to vote for people who are incarcerated even more dependent on the goodwill of the sitting Secretary of State at the time.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Pennsylvania is a microcosm of a divided nation.
It’s one of only three states to have a politically divided state legislature. Republican control the Senate by four seats and Democrats have a one-seat majority in the House. 
The commonwealth’s one of only four states to have a split U.S. Senate delegation: Sen. John Fetterman (D) and Sen. David McCormick (R). 
The state voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2024 and former President Joe Biden in 2020. 
On top of that, state budget negotiations continue to drag on months after the fiscal year deadline. 
Could the investment of more pickleball courts in Pennsylvania be the pathway towards mitigating political division, cultivating civic engagement, and working together despite political differences?
In his seminal work “Bowling Alone,” political scientist Robert Putnam noted that more people were ‘bowling alone’ rather than joining bowling leagues. He argued that this was symptomatic of a decline in social capital, which he defined as “the collective value of all ‘social networks’ and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other.”
The decline in social capital may be contributing to increased partisanship, a decrease in volunteerism, and the decline in civility in political discourse. Alarmingly, a recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that there has been a spike (30% in Oct 2025 from 19% in April 2024) in the number of people from both parties saying that at times political violence may be necessary.

One possibility to increase social capital is to supplant “bowling leagues” with pickleball groups. Playing pickleball with people outside of one’s immediate social network can potentially soften partisan edges and foster greater empathy with others. Pickleball courts regularly feature times for “open” play, whereby players from all backgrounds and levels are invited to participate. Players rotate partners and opponents frequently, encouraging interaction beyond existing social or political bubbles.
In one widely-reported case, a woman in a Pittsburgh suburb played with members of the Pittsburgh Steelers, including T.J. Watt, and did not even know that they were NFL football players until a crowd had gathered to watch them play. 
Pickleball groups connect people across lines that often divide us, including different socio-economic backgrounds and generations, which exposes them to different points of views, including partisan views. There is already a bipartisan U.S. Senate Pickleball Caucus that meets regularly to play. 
Beyond political loyalties, there are no shortage of things that divide Pennsylvanians, including the battle over Wawa v. Sheetz or Pittsburgh sports teams v. Philly sports teams. But on the pickleball court, players encourage each other, strategize together, and build real-world relationships that are not necessarily sorted by online algorithms on their social media feeds or partisan media consumption habits.
The truth is that Pennsylvania – like many states – could stand to benefit from a boost of social capital. Volunteer fire departments, which cover most of the fire responses in Pennsylvania, are struggling to find a new generation of volunteers, and the same applies for EMS volunteers. 
Churches, which have traditionally been a source of building social capital, are struggling to find parishioners to fill their pews. According to the Pew Religious Landscape Study, only 28% of Pennsylvanians attended church once per month or more in 2023-2024, compared to 49% in 2014. 
As America’s fastest growing sport with over 19 million pickleballers in the United States, Pennsylvania should go all in on the pickleball bandwagon. Pickleball isn’t a cure-all, but it is a step toward building community. It promotes physical health, mental well-being, and civic connectedness, and it exposes players to people and perspectives they might never otherwise encounter. 
If Governor Shapiro is serious about “getting s*** done,” then let’s take a tangible step towards increasing social capital and build more pickleball courts in the Commonwealth. If Pennsylvanians can learn to live together more harmoniously, we can lead the way for the rest of our country.

The Planned Parenthood affiliates said they received letters from the Ohio Department of Medicaid, dated Sept. 24, suggesting they be cut from Medicaid. The letter referenced the federal budget reconciliation bill that was passed and signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, which bans Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid payments for one year. 
“We have officially requested a hearing with the Ohio Department of Medicaid to affirm our status as a trusted Medicaid provider without any reports of misconduct that would justify our termination from Medicaid,” Melissa Cohen, general counsel for PPGOH and PPSWO, said in a statement. “We hope the hearing will clarify that the federal funding prohibition is purely a political attack on Planned Parenthood and does not provide any basis for ODM to terminate Planned Parenthood from the program.”
The national Planned Parenthood Federation of America is suing to stop the federal cuts from being enforced. A federal judge temporarily stopped the cuts in July, but another judge allowed the cuts to go through in a September ruling. The national Planned Parenthood group pledged to continue fighting the law. Medicaid already does not cover direct abortion services. 
The Ohio Department of Medicaid did not respond to the Ohio Capital Journal’s request for comment. 
Banning Planned Parenthood from Medicaid will prevent more than 27,000 Ohioans from accessing reproductive health care at their centers, according to the organization. 
Two Planned Parenthood clinics in Springfield and Hamilton closed earlier this year and Medicaid cuts were cited as the reason. Those clinics did not provide abortion services, focusing instead on primary care services and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio President and CEO Nan Whaley said she was disappointed but not surprised. 
“Anti-abortion politicians are once again using every tool at their disposal to block people from accessing essential, life-saving care at Planned Parenthood, indefinitely,” she said in a statement. “This move is part of a broader, coordinated strategy to push reproductive health care out of reach.”

(Submitted)Much like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman joined forces to fight evildoers as the Justice League, so the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, Kansas Action for Children and Kansas Appleseed joined forces to combat apathy and misinformation with a recent cross-state tour.
The three nonprofits aimed to inform residents about H.R. 1, the tax and spending package touted as a “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump. As we’ve written repeatedly, that law literally takes resources from the poor through cuts to Medicaid and food stamps and gives them to the rich as tax cuts. All three organizations raised alarms as the bill was being debated, and while some of its roughest edges have been sanded down, daunting problems remain. Members spoke to audiences in Iola, Garden City, Hutchinson and Manhattan toward the end of September and beginning of October.
To learn more, I sat down to talk with April Holman of the Alliance, Adrienne Olejnik of KAC and Haley Kottler from Appleseed. Here are a handful of big worries and small mercies from our conversation.


 
Why go on tour?
Kotter: “I think we really wanted folks to understand how deep the cuts went in this bill. I think a lot of people had heard ‘one big, beautiful bill.’ They had heard that President Trump signed it on the Fourth of July, and they maybe knew some of the top provisions in it. But I think what was unique about this was standing together on several different issues and showing how they all interconnect.”
Holman: “Our hope was that people would walk away understanding that even though this is a huge bill and the health care cuts might be very weedy in terms of the policy, that impact was going to be really significant in Kansas, among people that they knew, and perhaps among themselves even. … To put that accountability piece into the work is important to us.”
 
What’s happening now?
Kottler on SNAP: “The biggest threat right now immediately is that there are some cuts that are going to go into effect on Nov. 1. For the first time ever, parents are going to be subject to work requirements. … For the first time ever, parents with children 14 or over are going to be subject to 30-hour-a-week work or training requirements. Additionally, seniors up to 64 are going to have to have these work requirements as well. And that’s just one piece of this puzzle. Those are the most immediate.”
She also highlighted increased SNAP cost sharing with the state: “We’re hearing from other states that their agencies are saying, ‘We don’t know how we’re going to even run the program,’ and I think that’s a risk that Kansas will will face as well. So we’re really going to be in a bind on SNAP in the next couple years.”
 
How do Kansans feel?
Olejnik: “People are already seeing impacts in their communities. H.R. 1 is just one piece of what we’ve already seen in cuts from the state over the years, from the federal government in other ways and other spending programs this year already. So it feels like just one more thing now that they’re going to have to worry about. They already have stories of impact to share before H.R. 1 is even coming to their community and hitting programs like Medicaid, SNAP. We heard from churches who are struggling to feed people. We heard from child care providers who are really concerned about impacts on the families that they serve, and they don’t know how they’re going to meet some of their basic needs. So it was really a hard conversation, but it was important to have.”
 
What does the shutdown mean?
Kottler: Without action, “SNAP benefits will not go out in Kansas in November, or until the government shutdown is discontinued. We’ve heard from the state agency that they need about 72 hours to put out benefits. So Oct. 28 is kind of the drop dead date for benefits to go out on time in November for SNAP. … I was up until 1 in the morning talking to someone who does food pantry work, who has just been inundated with families this week because they are worried about their benefits going away.”
Holman on Affordable Care Act plan costs: “There are going to be a lot of people across the country who are expected to lose their coverage, and in Kansas, we think that it could increase the level of uninsured Kansans by as much as 27%. It’s going to mean a really significant increase in the cost of those plans, an average of 77%, so that is enormous. … We’re getting to the point where open enrollment is going to happen, the higher costs are going to be baked in to next year’s premiums for people.”
 
What gives you hope?
Olejnik “We’re really hoping that Kansans keep paying attention, and they keep connecting the dots to what is happening, and they share their feedback — the stories about the impact of these federal changes — with each other and with their lawmakers. Secondly, it is not too late ever for the federal government and Congress to make different choices. We know that’s why we’re in a shutdown right now, because of the impact of these advanced premium tax credits” for ACA plans.
Finally, Olejnik asked: “What are state lawmakers going to do with all of this? They have some really tough decisions ahead, and when they come back to their regular session in January, they’re going to be confronted with quite a few of those.”

More than seven years ago, my husband and I received devastating news: our perfect baby boy had been diagnosed with a rare, terminal genetic condition called Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (also known as Niemann Pick Disease Type A/B) — ASMD for short.
What made this diagnosis even more difficult was the fact that we found out we were expecting our daughter just three days prior. We quickly learned that any of our offspring has a 25% chance of inheriting this disease. A year later, our beautiful daughter was born, and our hearts shattered for a second time when she, too, was diagnosed with ASMD.
The diagnosis was completely soul-crushing, but the true nightmare came later—learning just how hard we’d have to fight the health care system to keep our children alive.
When our children were first diagnosed, doctors told us they wouldn’t live past the age of three. Today, they are six and seven, growing, thriving, and living full lives in their own beautiful way. Due to the progressive neurological disease from their condition, they are both nonverbal, use wheelchairs, are tube-fed, and require around-the-clock care. Every medication, every feeding, every bath, every shift of their bodies is planned and aided by a caregiver.
It’s exhausting, yes, but everything I do is for my children, and I’m honored to be able to care for them. Every day, I get to witness miracles in motion. They are stable today because we’ve been fortunate enough to have the at-home care they need—care that has only been made possible through Medicaid. It pays for their nursing, their life-saving infusion medications, therapies, and even the specialized equipment that allows us to keep them safe in our home. Without Medicaid, my kids wouldn’t just lose comfort; they wouldn’t be able to survive.
That’s why every time I hear our members of Congress talk about yet another round of “budget negotiations,” “health care cuts,” or about the different ways they plan to make government more “efficient,” my stomach drops and my heart breaks. Parents like me know exactly what these words mean: It means wondering if the treatments keeping our children alive will still be here tomorrow.
Right now, the government shutdown has put programs like Medicaid back on the chopping block. For so many families like mine, the consequences aren’t a number on a spreadsheet; they’re a terrifying nightmare. When Washington freezes, the systems that families depend on slow to a crawl. Our requests for approvals on essential medical equipment and special medications get delayed. And the nurses who support our home care can’t get paid. Every bureaucratic pause adds up to very real suffering for the people at the end of those systems.
But to be blunt, these cuts didn’t start with this shutdown—and re-opening the government won’t magically fix the damage. The cuts have been happening quietly, piece by piece, since the beginning of the year. Every budget that trims “nonessential” services chips away at the fragile scaffolding that keeps children like mine, elders and entire communities alive.
When politicians talk about “reducing spending,” what they’re actually reducing is access to care. They’re talking about fewer hours of care for children who can’t breathe or eat on their own. They’re talking about cutting aid to parents like me who have been forced to quit our jobs to become full-time caregivers. They’re talking about families bathing their disabled children in unsafe ways because the home modification grant they were promised is still waiting for approval.
It took me years to learn how to navigate the health care system. Every form, every appeal, every phone call feels like a test of endurance. And still, even with all that effort, I live in constant fear of what might be taken away next.
Families like mine are already doing everything we can to hold our lives together, to keep our children safe, comfortable, and cared for.
We shouldn’t have to fight this hard for care that should be a basic human right. My children and so many others like them deserve better.
It’s time for our leaders to stop treating health care as a bargaining chip.

A nonprofit group has launched a petition campaign to put both bricks on the ballot in hopes of making them constitutional amendments. That’s […],"Nebraska's primary election in 2024 was the first statewide election to require poll workers to check photo IDs. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Among a recent rash of bad ideas comes two recycled clangers for Nebraskans: Hand counting paper ballots for all state elections and adopting a winner-take-all format to determine the state’s presidential electors.
A nonprofit group has launched a petition campaign to put both bricks on the ballot in hopes of making them constitutional amendments. That’s about right. We apparently have a thing here about changing our guiding principles. We — voters or legislators — have amended the current constitution 240 times since its adoption in 1875.
That said, neither of these ideas seem worth the ink. The requirement that all elections use paper ballots and that those ballots are then counted by hand flies in the face of research on election accuracy. Plus, any revival of the winner-take-all system seemingly comes up only when the GOP loses in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Only Maine and Nebraska choose electors by district.
This space has used more than enough column inches arguing that instead of changing the rules to make it easier for the GOP to capture Nebraska’s “blue dot” in Omaha, maybe it should try to compete for votes there with better ideas.
Changing to a winner-take-all system is a calculating cousin of recent attempts to treat elections as civic duties with which we can do as we please. Midcycle redistricting — redrawing congressional districts between census counts — is trending for the GOP as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina are redrawing congressional districts at the urging of the White House in hopes of gaming the system to win in 2026. Democratic stronghold California has chosen to leave redistricting up to voters, who will decide in November whether to respond with its own plan that would in part offset Republican gains.
Much of the ruckus may end up in court as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits redrawing districts based on race unless it is to remedy past discrimination. Plus, the Supreme Court has already heard oral arguments on the issue this session and will weigh in on Section 2 next spring. 
Meanwhile, other states, including Virginia as of this writing, surely have their sharpies ready to redraw, making congressional races more about gyrating geography than good ideas.
Color me nostalgic, but I long for the days when voters chose their politicians rather than today’s redistricting nonsense that lets politicians choose their voters. 
As for trying to sell Nebrasakans on the idea of hand counting ballots comes this bit of promotion from those championing the cause. “This petition simply codifies the most secure and publicly verifiable method of counting votes by prioritizing the manual counting of every ballot. We are setting a strong precedent that can be a trend setter for other states looking to restore public confidence in their election system.” 
Well, perhaps. Still, I’m at a loss as to how hand counting paper ballots adds to security and transparency. Or why another state would follow suit.
What we do know — or should — is that the science clearly indicates that counting by hand not only extends the time between the polls closing and the final tabulation, it increases the likelihood of errors. While hand counting may strike some as simple, it’s hardly a model of efficiency and accuracy given the science and current available technology. 
Aside from ceding efficacy and precision, exactly which Nebraskans — apart from the group trafficking the hand count and winner-take-all — are clamoring to restore public confidence in our election system? While we’re at it, maybe somebody could give us the details of any recent or former fraud that may have skewed an election outcome or sullied the state’s reputation as a place that conducts and embraces fair, free and unencumbered elections. We’ll wait. 
Nor are mechanical vote tabulators some cog in a nefarious, AI-inspired rise of the electoral machines. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission requires each machine to count 10 million ballots without an error. When reviewing hand counts to the work of the machines, the commission showed that, especially when faced with large numbers of ballots, human errors can reach 25 percent.
Finally, hand counting costs more than machine tabulations. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, Shasta County in northern California estimated that if it used hand counting to tabulate its 100,000-plus votes, it would cost taxpayers $1.6 million, use 1,200 additional staff and take 18 days, not counting any redos because of errors.
Everyone wants secure, accurate and timely election results. A campaign to add a couple of new, old ideas to the Nebraska Constitution does nothing to further that goal.

As the days grow shorter and autumn settles in, it’s a good time to shine a light on a topic that can feel mysterious: your credit score. For many, credit can feel confusing or even intimidating, but understanding how it works and why it matters can be an important step toward strengthening your financial health journey.
How Your Credit Score Impacts Your Financial Journey
Your credit score is a three-digit number used by lenders, landlords, insurance companies, mobile phone providers, and financial institutions to assess your reliability. A higher score can help you qualify for lower interest rates and better loan terms, saving you money in interest and making it easier to achieve major financial goals such as buying a home or car.
Establishing good credit means building a record of responsible usage. Using your credit card and paying your bill on time demonstrates financial responsibility to lenders. On the other hand, missing payment deadlines or not meeting the minimum amount due can negatively impact your score.
Understanding the Factors Behind Your Credit Score
Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850. The better your score, the more options you may have with lenders. Here’s what usually influences your score:

Payment History: Consistently paying bills on time has a positive impact, while late or missed payments can lower your score.
Credit Utilization: Using a smaller portion of your total available credit is better for your score; high balances relative to your total credit limits can be a negative factor.
Total Debt: Lower overall debt is viewed more favorably, while carrying high debt can reduce your score.
Types of Credit Accounts: Having a mix of credit accounts, such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages, can strengthen your score.
Length of Credit History: A longer track record of responsible credit use contributes positively to your score.
Recent Credit Applications: Applying for new credit  can temporarily lower your score.
Credit Inquiries. Soft inquiries, like checking your own credit or receiving pre-approved offers, don’t affect your score. Hard inquiries, such as applying for a loan or credit card, may lower your score slightly, but the impact fades over time and drops off your report after two years.

If your credit score is on the lower end, don’t worry—there are steps you can take to help improve it.
Credit Smart Habits for

Pay your bills on time. Payment history is an important factor when it comes to calculating your credit score. If you struggle with meeting payment deadlines, consider setting reminders or enrolling in autopay.
Pay down your debt. Your credit utilization—meaning the size of your card balance—is the second biggest factor in most credit scoring models. Create a plan to pay down high-interest debt first.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Can you show us on the doll where education hurt you? 
According to the Right, schools and colleges are hotbeds of anti-American degeneracy propagated by teachers hell bent on indoctrinating the young into evil opinions and all manner of weirdness, thus hastening the nation’s descent into the kind of depravity that spurs atrocities such as painting rainbow crosswalks, wearing inflatable frog suits, and flying upside-down American flags at “No Kings” marches.
Y’all clutching those pearls yet? 
The very people always telling us to “do your own research” don’t really want you to do your own research, unless they get to pick the sources.
They don’t want you to listen to people who’ve spent years and years in universities and labs, no academically rigorous studies, no evidence-based information, no verifiable facts.
Who needs expertise?  
Florida, you will not be surprised to hear, is a model for the nation, walking backward into the future.
Rep. Tom Fabricio (R-Miami Lakes) has filed a bill demanding classroom teachers take an oath to uphold the constitutions of Florida and the United States and promise to conduct themselves “in a professional, independent, objective, and nonpartisan manner.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThey would swear “that I will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity and professional ethics; that I will foster a respectful learning environment for all students, which promotes critical thinking, civic responsibility, and lifelong learning; and that I will serve as a positive role model in both conduct and character, so help me God.” 
Couple of issues with this: 1. Classroom teachers already sign an oath to uphold both constitutions; 2. Would this new oath also apply to teachers at schools that take taxpayer-funded vouchers?
What if some school board or some parent decides a class on evolution is “partisan” because most Democrats will tell you the earth is older than 6,000 years?
Anti-science silliness has long been part of Florida’s brand. We’ve attacked evolution and championed teaching Creationism and “Intelligent Design.”
As for the “positive role model in both conduct and character” stuff, who gets to say what that means?
Do evangelicals accept that a gay teacher can be a “positive role model”? What about a teacher who posts something the DeSantis administration doesn’t like on her private social media?
At least three K-12 teachers have been fired for something they said about Charlie Kirk, the ultra-conservative campus activist who was murdered last month.
University professors have also lost their jobs or been sanctioned, often for quoting Kirk’s own words.
He’s the one who said it was “worth it to have a cost of — unfortunately — some gun deaths every single year” in order to preserve the Second Amendment. 
Swearing oaths
You know that Constitution thing? The one teachers (and politicians, lawyers, etc.) swear to uphold? It guarantees all of us the right to free expression, even if it upsets the government. 
But the DeSantis administration seems happy to trash that pesky First Amendment whenever they feel like it, forbidding educators to discuss systemic racism — no learning about redlining, unequal access to justice, Jim Crow, habitual dumping of toxic waste in minority communities, or denying Black veterans access to GI Bill benefits — policing college course descriptions for naughty words such as “gender” and “decolonize,” or hyperventilating over the possibility sex mightnight be mentioned in the classroom.
They’re also happy to trash the Establishment Clause.
To be fair, Florida hasn’t gone quite as demented as Texas, where a state-sponsored (though not officially required) curriculum is basically Bible study. 
But given Florida wants to be Texas when it grows up, this might be what we have to look forward to.
A law passed last year allows “volunteer chaplains” in schools. Counselors and psychologists cost money; the district doesn’t have to pay some unlicensed, untrained rando preacher with time on his hands.
So far, few school systems have taken the state up on its offer to install a member of the God Squad in taxpayer-funded institutions.
Hernando County, however, has taken the plunge with the Rev. Jack Martin, a failed Republican congressional candidate and member of the “Black Robe Regiment,” an outfit dedicated to demolishing the wall between Church and State.
Martin has called for President Barack Obama to be arrested and thinks public schools force kids “to believe stuff they shouldn’t.”
He’s also written a song in praise of the “martyr” Charlie Kirk.
Blackmail
This is on-brand for Florida, where school vouchers are intended to destroy public education, and universities are threatened with financial penalties if they hire the wrong professors or teach the wrong things.
To demonstrate who’s boss, Rep. Kevin Steele, R-Dade City, a backbencher clearly looking to grab a little publicity, has filed a bill that would force all 40 Florida colleges and universities to name streets after Charlie Kirk.
The bill even specifies exactly which streets: Chieftain Way at FSU, Stadium Road at UF, and West Osceola at FAMU, to name but a few.
If the streets don’t get renamed, colleges and universities will be defunded.
Yet again: issues.

 This is yet another in the long series of governmental attacks on university autonomy and may have constitutional problems, too. As one UF grad student with a law degree, herself a Kirk fan and member of Turning Points USA, said, it “raises a huge red flag.”
 Students across the state are largely opposed. A computer science major at UF pointed out Kirk “wasn’t some civil rights activist,” but went around “actively spewing hatred.”

Tina Meyaart, a student in Communications at FSU, called it “grossly disrespectful,” especially since Kirk was pro-gun and the person charged with the mass shooting at Florida State was allegedly a member of Kirk’s TPUSA.

There is no West Osceola at FAMU. That street was renamed Rudy Hubbard Way earlier this year.  

Is the Legislature really going to force the nation’s premier Black public university to ditch the name of a road honoring the Hall of Fame football coach who led the Rattlers to two Black College National Championships in favor of a guy who once called the Civil Rights Act “a huge mistake,” among other offensive comments?
This is Florida. The answer may end up being yes.
Slash and burn
President Donald Trump’s slash-and-burn policies have cost Florida universities millions in research money. As of May, FSU had lost $53 million in grants from the National Science Foundation, USAID, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Department of Agriculture, and others.
At USF, EPA grants that would have allowed the university to bring scientific solutions to contaminated water in poor communities got axed.
FAMU lost $4.9 million that would have promoted climate-friendly hemp growing. USDA called the program “far-left.”
Ron DeSantis has not said one word in defense of Florida’s colleges and universities.
Why would he? His administration despises education in general and higher education in particular.
It’s obvious why: The more you know, the less gullible you are, the more willing to question authority, the more able to imagine and empathize with the lives of people who aren’t like you.

We’ve ignored this growing problem for too long.,"In his recent essay in CT Mirror, Melvin Medina asked: whose voices matter to Connecticut policymakers when we talk about housing? I hope it’s clear to anyone listening that the voices of those who need affordable, accessible, and safe housing are being drowned out by what Mel calls the “No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition.”
Connecticut once welcomed newcomers, young families, and growing businesses as essential to our civic and economic life. My own family benefited from growth-friendly policies in 1971, when my young parents were able to buy a small ranch-style home in Waterbury to raise their growing family. I want my kids to have the same opportunities in Connecticut, but that’s unlikely if we keep ignoring what young people are telling us.
Still, I feel a shift. Have you noticed it too? Connecticut’s foundations are shifting. Too many young people don’t see a future for them in Connecticut. We’ve ignored this growing problem for too long. Like so many of life’s challenges, the longer we delay facing our housing affordability crisis, the harder it becomes to solve. It’s simply too expensive to afford a home in Connecticut, and the consequences of denial are becoming more severe.
I work in housing policy, and I hear heartbreaking stories every day from people struggling to find or keep a home. But something unusual is happening more often — maybe it’s happening to you, too. More and more people in my personal life are sharing how Connecticut’s housing problems — high costs, limited options, aging and unsafe homes — are making their lives less secure, less affordable, and less successful.
Here are three stories I’ve heard recently from people who didn’t know I work in housing policy:

A family fears eviction without cause if they ask their landlord to make necessary repairs. They choose not to ask and instead try to fix the problems themselves. They know how difficult, if not impossible, it would be to find another affordable rental home in their school district. They want their son to stay with the friends and teachers he loves.
A young man who recently sold my daughter a car wishes he could live closer to his job and family in Fairfield County. He endures a long commute from the Naugatuck Valley because he and his wife can’t afford to rent closer to work. Now, they’re considering a larger apartment even farther away to make room for a future family. What he really wants is to buy a home but that feels impossible.
A young dental hygienist is frustrated that she still lives with her parents, despite avoiding student loan debt and working multiple jobs in her field for years. Her advice to young graduates is practical but disheartening: move out of state.

Connecticut’s housing shortage is reshaping people’s life choices. It’s weakening our families and our economy like rot in a home’s foundation that, left untreated, spreads through the structure. What was once a limited and solvable problem is now systemic, demanding immediate and serious intervention.
Yet, our local and state leaders have not been united to address the crisis. Too many local officials remain obstacles to progress, letting those voices of NO dictate a less vibrant future for Connecticut. We’re still waiting for the promised special session from the Connecticut General Assembly and Governor Lamont after the governor’s veto of a comprehensive housing bill in June.
When it comes to housing, the status quo isn’t working. Building homes is harder and more expensive than ever. Public policy can’t fix everything, but the state must do what it can. We need our leaders to share the urgency that this crisis has brought to so many of our neighbors and pass meaningful reforms.
Legislators and Governor Lamont: please return to the Capitol, meet in special session, and begin the hard work of rebuilding the foundation of housing affordability and stability for the people of Connecticut.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 04:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,No candy in elementary school? No smartphones in high school,Emily Bauer,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/no-candy-in-elementary-school-no-smartphones-in-high-school/,High schoolers should be restricted from using cell phones in the classroom the same way we limit candy in elementary school.,"It is a melancholy mission for those who walk the cafeterias of our great nation’s elementary schools to behold the tender children of the Republic, their lunch trays burdened with broccoli, their faces solemn, their spirits subdued. These young citizens, deprived of joy and simple pleasure, choke down baked chicken and steamed vegetables, while candy—sweet, radiant candy—lies banished, deemed too dangerous for their delicate constitutions.
I think it is agreed that this deplorable situation must be remedied, and that children should be allowed, nay entitled, to select candy as a legitimate option for lunch.
I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my thoughts on this most righteous addition, which I expect will not be subject to the least objection.
The Proposal
Every elementary school shall be required to offer candy as a regular, state and local board of education-approved lunch option, equal in standing to the turkey sandwich, the whole grain vegan wrap, or bagel with butter option. Elementary-aged children, upon entering the cafeteria, may exercise their unalienable rights to freedom of choice by selecting as part of their school lunch from a variety of tantalizing confection offerings—candy bars, jellybeans, gummy bears, and, for the health-conscious, dark chocolate (70% cacao minimum).
The Advantages of This Scheme

Cultivation of Moral CharacterThough candy is known to be addictive and nearly impossible to resist, the opportunity to abstain builds character and virtue. What better way to teach self-control than to place temptation directly in reach of a four to eleven- year-old? It is by confronting vice that true grit and character is forged.
Rewarding Good ChildrenWe must remember that these are “good children,” raised on parental and societal affirmations steeped in sound nutrition. Surely being model, mini-adults entitles them to the option—if not the necessity—of choice. Denying candy is an unspeakably paternalistic insult to their moral worth and conception of self-worth.
Therapeutic Benefit for the Candy-DependentFor those unfortunate youths already succumbed to candy addiction, this policy will serve as exposure therapy and fulfil the school’s obligation to grow and train such children emotionally. Permitting access to known weaknesses, those children will surely develop the strength to overcome temptation and addiction, as is the case with some. History has shown this method to be universally successful, at least according to social media posts and comments.
Minimal Collateral DamageNow, some have raised the alarm that permitting candy at lunch will unleash scenes of ungovernable frenzy — that the halls shall echo with the delirious laughter of sugar-maddened youth, that teachers shall cower behind their Chromebooks as children overturn desks and rend the very Smartboards from the walls. These apprehensions, though charming in their naïveté, are founded upon nothing more substantial than hysteria. For if any parent objects, let them simply instruct their own offspring to abstain from such sugary indulgence, and further, to remove themselves from the presence of any classmate who dares to partake. Surely this modest act of self-segregation will present no difficulty to the progeny of those noble families still guided by “old-fashioned” principles — those steadfast souls who raise their children as though it were still the era of rotary telephones and VCRs. 
Physiological SuitabilityEveryone knows that children have famously fast metabolisms. Their small bodies burn sugar with the intensity of a ravenous tiger. Thus, the consumption of candy as an occasional main or even side dish at lunch would serve to merely sustain their natural energy levels, preventing that tragically familiar afternoon fatigue.
Emergency PreparednessSignificantly, in an age where schools must be vigilant against all manner of threats—from weather events to escaped wildlife roaming the halls—it is only prudent to ensure our children are equipped. Candy offered at lunch, being light, portable, and high in caloric content, can be safely stored in a child’s pocket in the case of such an emergency. 
Dental Concerns Grossly ExaggeratedSome nervous Nellies warn that candy will rot the children’s teeth. But such fears are misplaced. Parents may simply instruct their children not to eat candy at home and to brush their teeth while at home instead. In this way, schools promote freedom and sweetness, while the parents maintain oral hygiene and stricter rules in the privacy of their own homes. Truly, a perfect balance of liberty and responsibility.
Parental SovereigntyTo deny a parent’s right to send their child to school that offers an option of candy at lunch is to deny the very foundation of liberty. What next—will the school prohibit their smart devices? I shudder to think what tyranny lies ahead of that slippery slope.
Culinary ExcellenceCandy, unlike the mundane meat and sides currently served, is delicious. The human palate evolved to crave pleasure, and to deprive a child of this natural delight is both cruel and unusually contrary to nature.
Preparation for AdulthoodLastly, we must recognize that children will have access to candy for the rest of their lives. It is better that they now learn, while under the supervision of the public school system, to make wise dietary choices. After all, a well-timed sugar crash in third grade may prevent far greater misjudgments in college.

Conclusion
I must profess in all sincerity to a personal interest in promoting this necessary reform, having observed my young citizen and her comrades clearly benefit academically and social-emotionally from a deliberative fill-up on candy goodness during school hours, even though it is not presently permitted. Though, I must also confess to holding a modest amount of stock in a local candy shop near a local elementary.
I merely offer this proposal for the good of the children of the nation, in the hopes that one day our children may roam the cafeterias free, joyful, and sticky-fingered, munching on chocolate with teeth to which gobs of sugared crystals from lollypops are affixed, beneath the watchful eye of liberty herself.
Reader – If you cannot support allowing elementary students the option of candy at school despite all the reasons above, then by precisely the same logic, you should oppose allowing high school students to access personal smart devices during school hours.

Starting Nov. 1, New Mexico will offer free child care to every family in the state. There will be no fees to pay and no income limits to sign up, according to the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
State leaders and newspapers across the country claim it as the first universal child care paid for by a state.
People who support the program say it will help parents keep their jobs, give child care workers better pay, and make the economy stronger — adding it will also help the state’s youngest children who get the care.
“The well-being of kids is tied to the well-being of the adults in their lives,” said Dr. Philip Fisher, a professor of early childhood at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education and director of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood. “And adults’ well-being depends on their economic circumstances.”
But there’s a problem. New Mexico might not have enough child care centers to actually take care of all the children whose families want help. There simply aren’t enough spots available, especially for babies and families living out in smaller towns.
The state has gradually helped more families with child care assistance since 2019. By 2023, families making 400% of the federal poverty level were able to get help, opening the program to more middle- and higher-income families.
Right now, about 27,000 children across the state get child care, according to the Legislative Finance Committee’s 2025 Accountability Report on Early Childhood. Officials think another 12,000 children will join the program when it becomes universal.
But the committee found, as of this year prior to the new subsidy going into effect, there were only enough openings for about one out of every three babies under age two. The shortage was even worse in rural counties where almost no licensed infant care exists.
The number of child care spots dropped by 3% between 2019 and 2023. That’s mostly because the number of people providing child care in their homes dropped by half, according to data from the Cradle to Career Policy Institute at the University of New Mexico. Most of the drop was in unlicensed home-based care—places that were simply registered as providers.
Not counting those home providers that closed, the numbers would show more licensed child care centers, which have higher quality ratings from the state. But home-based providers are more likely to offer care at night or in a family’s native language. With so many of them gone, families who work night shifts or want someone who speaks their language may have a harder time finding the right fit, according to the institute. It’s worth noting that the share of assistance going to families at or below the poverty line fell by nearly 3% between 2019 and 2023.
State officials know there are not enough child care options and have announced a $12.7 million fund that offers low-interest loans to build new centers or fix up old ones. They plan to ask lawmakers for another $20 million. The growth will focus on care for babies and toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs. The state is also working with businesses and schools to open more locations and is trying to recruit new people to run child care in their homes.
To keep workers, state officials plan to pay child care centers more money so they can cover their real costs. Programs that pay staff at least $18 an hour and stay open 10 hours a day, five days a week will qualify for incentive rates.The state plans to boost child care in underserved communities by making sure workers get fair pay and by using data to make smart choices, said Elizabeth Groginsky, secretary of the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
Fair wages can help child care workers think of early education as a real career instead of just a temporary job. That means they can build lasting relationships with the children and families they serve, Groginsky said. “We use data to drive our decisions. We just completed a supply-and-demand study with interactive maps showing which parts of the state have the largest gaps. That will guide how we fund applications through the new loan program.”
Even with those plans, questions remain about who will benefit most and how much difference the system will make for children.
While supporters say universal child care is a win for families and the economy, Republican lawmakers argue that removing income limits means taxpayers will now help pay for child care for wealthy families.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts have also questioned the program’s impact on learning. Their 2025 report found that while child care meets an essential need for working families, it does not have the same effect on kindergarten readiness as public pre-kindergarten programs.
But Fisher said the benefits go beyond teaching ABCs and 123s.
Stable, predictable, caring relationships are the foundation of healthy learning and development, he said. That matters more than exposing young children to math or reading skills that they will pick up anyway once they start school.
Healthy child development has more to do with relationships than what kind of child care you use, he said.
“There is not like a prevailing amount of evidence that having a child in a kinder care situation is going to lead the child to be a college graduate [versus] having them cared for by the lady down the street or in your apartment complex is going to lead them to end up, you know, incarcerated,” Fisher said.
Fisher also questioned whether the market alone can give families what they need.
“It’s a broken market,” he said. Parents can’t afford what high-quality care actually costs, employers don’t usually help cover it, and providers often don’t make enough to live on.
When adults are stressed about money, he said, it directly affects children.
“It’s easy to imagine that if you’re an adult who’s taking care of a young child, that if you yourself are worried about not having enough food for you to feed your family, or you’re skipping meals so you can feed the children, or you’re worried about eviction, or you can’t pay for health care, that those things weigh on you and that they take away from your ability to really buffer your child from what’s going on around them,” he said.
Groginsky said the stakes are high.
“The first five years is the fastest period of human development, with over a million new brain connections per second in a baby’s brain,” she said in an interview. “It’s those responsive, nurturing relationships that drive positive outcomes.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EarlyChildhood-2048x1454-1-1024x727.jpeg,,,2025-10-26 18:00:29.351725

(Photo by Mark Mirko/Connecticut Public)Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.
And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.
The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?
Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Anthony Nolan, D-New London, toward a press conference to celebrate the resumption of work on the Revolution Wind project.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.
“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.
“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.
But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.
DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.
But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.
“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.










The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated.

Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.
“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said.
Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.
“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“
But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.
“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.
“We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.
“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

(Photo courtesy of Iberdrola)After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.
If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.
But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.
 How dead is offshore wind?

Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.
“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.
“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”
Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.
Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.
“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”
Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.
A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes.

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.
A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”
“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.
He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.
“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.
“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.
“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.
“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.
Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.
“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.
“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.
The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.
In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.
Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.
Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.
Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”
 What about solar?

Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.
But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.
Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.










Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us.


– Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport


New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.
It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.
“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”
Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.
Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.
It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.
“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.
“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

Solar systems like this one on a condo project in Mystic will lose a federal tax credit that made them less expensive. The heat pumps also on the roof will lose their tax credit as well.

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.
Massachusetts is already doing that.
“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.
Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank.
“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”
She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”
DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.
In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.
 Solutions

Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions.
“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.
She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”
Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.
“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.
If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.
“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.
Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.
“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”
Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway.
“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”
In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.
The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.
But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue.
“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.
Dykes sees the same challenge.
“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”
The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”

Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.
In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called “Freaky Friday,” offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care. 
He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.
“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans — many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.
Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism. 
Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.
What Coloradans are saying about immigration
In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents. 
Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals. 

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction. 
“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”
A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”
“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”
“It’s a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I’m more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”
“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions. 
“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”  
Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has. 
At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.
A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion. 
“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it’s easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I’m not happy with my country.
“It’s like they’re not compromising. They’re not coming to a happy medium. They’re just combative. And that’s all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns
Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.
A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.
It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent). 
Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.
On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an “extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.” 
Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.
“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.
CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.
“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.
But the support for stanching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”
In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”
That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.
“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.
How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions
Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement. 
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.
In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.
That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.
Looking ahead
Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.
For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him — or other lawyers — to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days. 
“So when it comes to hurting people, the system’s gotten a lot faster. When it’s come to helping people, the system’s gotten a lot slower,” he said.
The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Afghanistan War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops. 
The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them. 
It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.
“I’ve dedicated my life to this, but the good legal advice has become, ‘Hide, or go somewhere else.’”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)It’s pumpkin season – from spiced lattes to Halloween decorations on the porch – and chances are it was grown in Illinois.
Just over a third of all pumpkins in the United States – 485 million pounds – come from Illinois, according to annual USDA surveys.
Much of that production centers on Morton, a village in Tazewell County that proudly calls itself the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.” About 85% of the world’s canned pumpkin is packed at the Nestlé/Libby’s plant in the middle of town.
Indiana ranks second in production, but Illinois grows roughly three times as many pumpkins, even after its production fell by 30% last year. That decline came even though the harvested acres remained steady; acreage had already dropped by nearly 18% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
Despite their hard exterior, pumpkins are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions.
Depending on the location, farmers typically begin planting between late May and early July, allowing the pumpkins approximately four months to mature for a fall harvest.
A late spring frost can wipe out young plants before they have a chance to take root. At the same time, extreme summer heat can cause blossoms to fall before they are pollinated, according to a 2024 publication from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Excessive rainfall can also delay planting in spring or harvesting in autumn, and leave crops more vulnerable to disease.
According to USDA Economic Research Service data, Illinois not only leads the nation in pumpkin production acreage but also devotes most of its fields to processing varieties, the kind used in pies and canned filling.
Nearly 70% of Illinois’ pumpkin acres are dedicated to pie filling and other processing uses, compared with just 3% in Pennsylvania and even less in Washington, Indiana, and California. This focus helps explain why Illinois outpaces other states in both yield and price.
Other states are catching up, though. In 2024, New York, Wisconsin and Michigan reported the most significant gains, with production increasing by 49%, 43%, and 33%, respectively.

This story was originally reported by Mel Leonor Barclay and Jasmine Mithani of The 19th. Meet Mel  and Jasmine and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.
A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.
Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.
The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.
The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.
“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”
A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”
Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.
Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.
“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.
“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”
A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.
The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.
In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”
The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.
LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.
FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims
 

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.
The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.
The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.
The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?
They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”
“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)
“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”
The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Domestic-violence-nonprofit-illustration-for-Oct-26-2025-story-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-26 08:16:43.929694

Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Act 73 needs to go back to the drawing board.","This commentary is by Peggy Stevens of Charleston.


Act 73 of 2025 “establishes a process for Vermont to transition to a reimagined system of public education” — that’s according to the state’s website explaining the law. The legislation is supposedly designed to streamline Vermont’s education system and alleviate the burden of education expenses on property tax payers.
I attended an informational meeting put on by the North Country Supervisory Union school board chair and superintendent in an effort to answer questions and concerns  community members have about the impacts of Act 73 in our supervisory union.
I came away astonished that this legislation was ever passed, especially by legislators who claim to be fiscally conservative. The bill has “reimagined” a funding system that is uncertain about what the ultimate cost will be. If you ask me, it is a pig in a poke, something that is bought or accepted without knowing its value or seeing it first.
The 17-page handout from the Joint Fiscal Office provided at the meeting included many “estimates” for various projected costs. There are instances of “unknown” and “yet to be determined” and “impact is unclear” in those 17 pages that could have severe unintended negative consequences for our schools and students, especially in rural Vermont. People need to know they were being sold an idea that makes it look like something is being done to help taxpayers when it can’t be proven! Many communities are actually likely to see an increase in taxes! So, potentially no gain and lots of pain
Of course, any piece of legislation cannot be absolutely certain what final costs may be, but this act seems to be chock full of uncertainty. Worse, in addition to financial repercussions, is the loss of local control. Our area schools will not have local boards and representation, in a school district potentially spanning from Canaan to Lowell to Glover that will have one school board of five to seven individuals chosen in “voting wards.” Folks will no longer vote on town school budgets, instead the boards of these “mega districts” will determine how the money is spent. 
I am sure there are many areas where education costs could be shared, streamlined and trimmed without leaving the future of our education funding system in jeopardy. Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests, especially our rural community schools, their students and teachers, and our taxpayers.
Talk to your legislators. Act 73 would best be repealed and brought back to the drawing board. We deserve a better process, and our students and taxpayers deserve a better future.

Sukkot
Sela Morgenstein Fuerst, 12, South Burlington
And there is room at our table, oh so much room, we are simply
bursting with food, we are overflowing.
Uniformity is not a problem in our sukkah. We can
name all the fruits, the breads, in different languages, colors,
dishes that are like nothing you’ve ever seen before. We are beautiful,
and it is beautiful, the amount, I mean, the muchness, this fracture of
normal or what we consider it to be. We want to be
considerate, to write labels on our food, to taste and split open in a grin,
electric lights blinking on and off like an overabundance of stars.

While President Donald Trump is demolishing the East Wing of the White House and no one is stopping him, there is a state law that prevents Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves from acting on his own to make major changes to the Governor’s Mansion. And to be clear, Gov. Reeves is not planning any major renovations to Mississippi’s version of the White House, though he does attempt to emulate President Trump.
This past week work began to remove, according to news reports, the entire East Wing of the White House – arguably the nation’s most recognizable building – to prepare for the construction of President Trump’s one big beautiful ballroom.
Who knew in America one person could tear down a portion of what we fondly called the people’s house and construct a massive structure that based on drawings will dwarf the original building and overwhelm the iconic White House grounds? For comparison, the original White House, situated on 18 acres, is 55,000 square feet while it is anticipated the ballroom will be 90,000 square feet.
Based on state law, one person cannot undertake similar activities to public buildings in Mississippi.

The guidelines established by the long-standing Antiquities Law of Mississippi govern work of many historic buildings in the state, including the Governor’s Mansion and the Capitol.
Under the law, any action involving “excavation, property transfer, excavation or ground disturbing activities of any nature, demolition or significant alteration” of a building or property designated as a Mississippi Landmark must be approved by the Department of Archives and History Board of Trustees. Mississippi landmarks could be state or local public buildings, including those found at education entities.
Granted, nearly every president makes changes to the White House. For instance, former President Barack Obama incorporated a basketball goal into the tennis court. And his wife, Michelle, had the nerve to add an organic vegetable garden.
Before Trump was inaugurated for his first term, conservative personality Ann Coulter posted on social media, “I respectfully suggest a new name for Michelle’s White House vegetable garden: ‘Putting green.’”
Trump already has made significant modifications to the White House, replacing one of its most legendary features – the Rose Garden – with a concrete patio. And he has incorporated enough gold features in the Oval Office to make envious Tony Montana, the drug-dealing kingpin in the movie “Scarface.”
Various groups, including the congressionally created National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Society of Architectural Historians, have urged a delay on the ballroom construction to gather more information and to allow input.
Who has been silent on the issue are congressional Republicans, including Mississippi U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith who previously served in the state Legislature where the Mississippi Antiquities Law was created. And Wicker was a vocal supporter of the designation of the Jackson home of civil rights leaders Medgar and Myrlie Evers as a national monument under the supervision of the National Park Service.
The National Capitol Planning Commission does have some authority over changes made to the White House. But Will Scharf, a Trump appointee and chair of the commission, said the president can do demolition at the White House on his own.

“Demolition and site preparation work can certainly occur, but if you’re talking about actually building anything, then, yeah, it should go through our approval process,” he said during an early September meeting, according to The Associated Press.
So, what does that mean? How much of the White House can the president demolish on his own? 
Scharf said there is nothing to worry about.
”Given the president’s history as a builder, and given the plans that we’ve seen publicly I think this will be a tremendous addition to the White House complex, a sorely needed addition,” he said.
Reports have said the ballroom will cost $250 million or more and private funds will be raised to pay for the structure.
Little else is known. If the funds are not raised, will Trump turn to Congress for taxpayer money to complete the project?
Or will he depend on Mexico to pay for it just as he said Mexico would pay for a border wall?
Incidentally, Trump is seeking money from American taxpayers to compensate himself for criminal investigations he has been subject to. He is asking for $230 million – almost enough to pay for one big beautiful ballroom.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/22140226/AP25295630685369-1.jpg,,,2025-10-26 07:16:31.680576

In a video called Investing In Place: Increasing the Impact of Land Conservation, a cartoonish red push pin hovers over a map of the United States, directing viewers to Norwich Farm, a small dairy operation along the border of Vermont and New Hampshire.
The scene here is quintessential New England. A red barn peeps out from snow while a few people in boots and barn coats crunch toward the barn’s big sliding door. Cows moo somewhere off screen. The camera pans to cheesemaker Chris Gray, his wife, and their five-year-old daughter, sandwiched between them, who calls herself “the cheese monster.” 
The family is at the center of a decade-long saga over a contested piece of farmland. The promotional video highlighted what appeared then to be a mutually beneficial partnership between a cheese maker, a state school, and a land trust headquartered in nearby New Hampshire. They were working together to conserve land and begin a new agricultural education program on a property called Norwich Farm. 
“I hope that Norwich Farms is a place that contributes to the wellbeing of the community as a whole,” Jeanie McIntyre, president of the Upper Valley Land Trust, the land conservation group involved in the partnership, said at the time.
Perhaps the fact that the promotional video was released on April Fool’s Day should have been a clue that the rosy vision would falter in the ensuing years. A decade and many media reports later, the Grays say the story of the partnership could end in the foreclosure of the farm and bankruptcy for their business. 
There were strong personalities on all sides, reluctant to compromise. There were millions of dollars at stake in beloved Vermont industries — agriculture and farming — which have continued to confront enormous losses. Today, the saga is reminiscent of parties trying to reclaim the narrative after a nasty break up. It’s also a singular example of how difficult it can be to sustainably finance a farm-based business without additional levers of support.
The land trust
The idea for the Upper Valley Land Trust came about in the 1980s. It evolved from a question that a pestering neighbor asked Dana Meadows, who became the first chair of the board of trustees of the land trust.


“How are we going to keep our farms in farming?” Meadows recalled the  neighbor asking in the trust’s 1987 annual report. 
Together with her community, Meadows thought community land trusts could be an answer, and in 1985, the land trust was born. 
Their goal was to keep agricultural land affordably in agriculture. Agreements between farmers and trusts could protect land and provide money or tax benefits to farmers in exchange for the sale of developmental rights and environmental protections. 
Land trusts around the country were originally formed to conserve land for the local community. Conservation was big federal business under President Theodore Roosevelt in the 20th century. Roosevelt launched land protections including the growth of the national parks system.

Things changed in the 1980s, when the federal government drastically scaled back its conservation of public lands. The gap was filled by land trusts and their donors, who receive federal tax incentives. Meanwhile, the global food system was shifting. International trade and technological innovation mutated U.S. farms, increasing consolidation and corporate control while access to affordable land decreased. 
More than 61 million acres have been conserved through land trusts across the U.S., according to the Land Trust Alliance, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. That includes more than 1.3 million acres conserved through dozens of active trusts in Vermont. They account for more than a fifth of the state’s total acreage. 
The scale of these operations vary. While town-based land trusts in Vermont, including ones in Charlotte, Richmond and South Hero, have protected hundreds of acres, massive national conservation groups like The Nature Conservancy and The Conservation Fund have protected hundreds of thousands. By far the biggest holder of state lands is the Vermont Land Trust, which has conserved more than 721,000 acres, according to the alliance, or more than a tenth of state land since 1977. 
The Upper Valley Land Trust falls somewhere in the middle of these groups in the size of its holdings. Based in Hanover, New Hampshire, the trust has conserved almost 35,000 acres in Vermont, according to the Land Trust Alliance, and almost 20,000 acres in the Granite State. In 2024, the Upper Valley Land Trust was worth more than $23 million in assets.
In the summer of 2015, the land trust paid $300,000 for 352 acres of farmland now called Brookmead Conservation Area in Norwich. The trust’s intent was to keep the Brookmead Conservation Area’s meadows and pastures conserved and to continue as a working farm, according to a 2018 brochure.
The trust bought the land from Vermont Technical College, which has since become Vermont State University. The land was donated to the college in 2015 by a millionaire named Andrew Sigler, a Dartmouth College graduate who had owned a forestry business, according to court records. Sigler bought the land from the Somerville family, once a Vermont Farm Bureau Farm Family of the Year. The property, where the family raised cows for generations, was the last remaining farm selling milk in Norwich. Before they sold it to the Siglers, it was called Brookmead Farm.

At the time, the trust persuaded the Norwich Conservation Commission, a local municipal group, to provide $30,000 to preserve the agricultural land for conservation and recreation, according to the trust’s request for assistance and subsequent emails. 
“Protection of this parcel will ensure that the land remains available for agricultural endeavors in the future,” with possible future site activities like cheese-making and animal husbandry classes, McIntrye wrote in a 2015 funding request.
At the time, the trust’s leaders knew that the state college planned to move its dairy herd to Norwich as part of a new program to educate students about the dairy industry. The purchase would provide the college with enough funds to launch the education program and provide a new opportunity for the trust to pursue its mission of land conservation.
Beyond the transaction, the college retained two parcels on an island cut out from Brookmead Conservation Area. This included roughly six acres of farm buildings, including a top of the line dairy barn built by Sigler, who had a penchant for Holstein genetics. There was also a house on two acres of land.
Under the vision of the college and the cheesemaker, these parcels would host a state-of-the-art dairy, a dormitory, and a small herd of cows that would have access to the surrounding pastures of Brookmead.
“The fact that we’ll be able to really inspire people to pursue an experience in agriculture or at the very least just understand the intimate connection between the food we make and the landscape that surrounds us is a really exciting thing,” Dan Smith, then president of the state college, said at the time. 

The creamery
Chris Gray met his wife, Laura Brown, working in the music industry. They began their family in Brooklyn, New York, but dreamt of getting out of the hustle and into food production.
So in 2010, just after their daughter was born, they bought a house and moved their family to southwestern Vermont. With business partners, they began a cheese making company in West Pawlet called Consider Bardwell Farm. (The business closed last year.) 
But when the Grays found out about the Norwich property, they decided to uproot again. 
“I took one look at this place, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, when do we start?’” Gray said. Over the years, it was overbuilt and underused, he said, but it was the only one like it in New England, with capabilities for a state-of-the-art, value-added dairy. He and Brown named their nascent business Lucky Us Ranch, LLC.

The Grays enrolled their daughter at a nearby school. Gray signed a temporary, one-year lease with the college in 2015. He helped the college design the property’s micro-dairy, and invested $150,000 in the buildout, he said. (According to a 2023 business plan, improvements to the farm since 2015 have cost $1 million; the creamery itself cost $650,000, largely paid for in grants and loans orchestrated by the college.)
By 2016, all the parties were still friendly, sometimes exchanging pleasantries over email. But then, the creamery started losing advocates at the college to job transitions. One of the first to leave was Chris Dutton, the chair of the college’s agricultural department who had championed the project, Gray said. Soon after, Dan Smith, the president of the college, moved to a position at the Vermont Community Fund. 
During the transition, the Grays signed a five-year lease with the college that included two options for ten-year extensions. 
Smith did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Emma Allen, the executive coordinator for the Vermont Community Fund, said Smith was on an unplugged sabbatical until early November and Allen was unable to get in touch with him.
The first semester of the on-farm dairy program was rocky from the start. Brown was hired as a residence director to help manage the six students in the dorm and buy groceries for the group. Gray worked as the cheese maker and a teacher on contract. The family paid $500 a month in subsidized rent for the three-bedroom farmhouse. 
Brown said that “a lot has been made” about the family’s low rent. “I want to qualify that we were teaching students,” she said.

Conflicts began to snowball. Gray and the former herd manager disagreed over the care of the cows and the quality of the milk. The creamery got a late start due to a delayed construction process. The students were disappointed in the program. They felt isolated in the small town of Norwich, according to a 2021 testimony from the college to state lawmakers, and they were unhappy being so far from the campus in Randolph. 
“I had three students come to speak with me, quite impassioned, of the six we had, saying, ‘This just isn’t working,’” said Patricia Moulton, then president of the college, in the 2021 testimony.
When the fall semester ended, the college planned to take the spring off and reassess the program, Gray said, before bringing students back in the fall of 2017. That spring, after conflicts with the herd manager, the cows left. The college helped pay for Gray to haul in milk. Gray began selling dairy products like ricotta cheese, yogurt, ice cream and bottled milk. 
But then the college, facing its own financial crisis, decided to end the program. Moulton, in an email response to questions this October, said the former agricultural program at the college’s Randolph campus later closed but parts of a new agricultural program could launch in the fall of 2026. Moulton did not agree to an interview because she said years had passed and her role at the campus had ended. Moulton is now the state’s flood recovery officer for central Vermont.

Ending the agricultural program in Norwich triggered an option the college had signed when they sold the land to the land trust. This option allowed the land trust to buy the six acre sliver that the college had retained when it sold the land back in 2015 — the pocket where the Grays lived. 
The option had set the price the land trust would pay at $50,000, a fraction of its actual market value in the affluent town of about 3,600 people. The median home value in Norwich exceeded $750,000 in Dec. 2024, according to Forbes, making it one of the priciest zip codes in the state. 
The dissolution of the partnership could have been less litigious if the Grays had cut their losses and tried to move their business to another property. But affordable farms are hard to come by. The average value of a farm has almost doubled in the last decade and a half, according to data published by the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service in August. In Vermont, land costs slightly more than the national average, about  $4,400 per acre. While farms are getting bigger in Vermont, largely due to consolidation, the number of farms has shrunk, according to a 2022 USDA agricultural census of the state.

“Everything that you read about us is that we’re horrible people,” Brown said while crying at her table in June. “That we’re tenants that won’t leave. That we’re planning an intensive dairy operation.”
“I feel like the truth needs to come out,” Brown said. 
“There’s many layers to this story,” said Anson Tebbetts, the state’s agricultural secretary, in an August interview. “You’ve got land agreements, you’ve got leases, you’ve got a state college going through a very difficult financial situation and that kind of unraveled in the middle. So a lot of things didn’t go as hoped and sometimes things just happen that way.” 
The Grays say they sunk roughly half a million dollars into their value-added agricultural business over the last decade. They say the land trust’s refusal to help a working farm sent them spiraling into debt, and now foreclosure could evict them from their home. They continue lobbing accusations against the land trust, claiming the organization orchestrated the debacle facing their small business. 
“A lot of people think we should have quit or given up but why would you? It’s literally a $50,000 problem that’s been turned into a million dollar situation,” Brown said.
McIntyre, president of the land trust during the entire saga, called the issue “ancient history,” and said she doesn’t want any part in the debate. Instead, according to McIntyre, it’s the land trust that lost out in the debacle, deprived of the opportunity to permanently protect the six-acre parcel of land. 
When asked about the damages that McIntyre claimed the land trust suffered on an August phone call, McIntyre’s voice rose in frustration. 
“We would own the building,” McIntyre said. “We would own the property where the Grays are currently located. I’m sorry to be short with you, but what is happening here is the Grays are attempting to create a story about something that isn’t a story anymore. This is done.”

The lawsuit
The Grays realized things were taking a turn for the worse when they met with the land trust in the fall of 2017, after the college’s education program shut down. As the land trust prepared to exercise its $50,000 legal option, they began to feel less confident in the future of their business. 
“It became clear immediately that they did not want to work with us,” Gray said. 
Part of that legal arrangement between the college and the land trust required the college to deliver the six-acres of land “unencumbered.” This meant that, if the land trust did not make a new deal with the creamery, the Gray family would need to leave. 
But the Grays refused to leave. Instead, the couple sent the land trust business plans outlining their proposals to stay in response to a request for proposals the land trust sent out.
In January 2018, as the land trust looked at business opportunities for the property including the one shared by the Grays, they offered the Gray family an estimate for a new lease rate. The proposed rate of $58,941 annually, or nearly $5,000 a month, included capital costs, real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities for the farmhouse and surrounding barn properties. It was about ten times the lease rate that the family was paying at the time. Later, the trust offered a lease rate for only the farm house for $2,500 plus utilities. Neither offer included the use of the adjacent farm land.
“No agricultural business could operate at Norwich retail market rates,” Gray said in an email this summer. “They are essentially creating conditions so bad that we would have no choice but to leave.”
McIntyre sees the situation differently. She said the land trust was doing its due diligence to determine whether they could afford to exercise the legal option and manage the property, including its carrying costs.
“We’re a land conservancy, so we can’t have our operating budget distorted or get into an untenable situation,” McIntyre said in an interview in October. “The Grays provided UVLT with a business plan at that time that demonstrated their business would not be able to meet those carrying costs, and they disparaged UVLT publicly for not being willing to let them stay on the property for $500 a month. They didn’t join us in figuring out how to pay for those carrying costs, they just showed us that they couldn’t.”
Although the Upper Valley Land Trust has long promised to maintain the agricultural value of these parcels, the trust didn’t allow the Grays to raise a herd of cattle on the adjoining pastureland. Instead, the trust has leased parcels for grazing to at least two other farmers. 
The Grays went on the offensive and rallied their neighbors for support. The neighbors, eager to retain local farm products, eventually formed a foundation to support the creamery.
Even the college tried to advocate for the Grays’ business. Moulton, in a March 2018 email, said she would like to speak face-to-face or by phone with McIntyre. Moulton said she was sending an email outlining plans for the farm because McIntyre “requested that I do so in writing.” Moulton noted that the college did not intend to operate a degree program at the farm but wanted to continue holding workshops with Gray, who in turn wanted to stay on the farm and expand his business.
“Their proposal seems to enable each of us to continue to operate within our preferred areas AND to enable agriculture and value added dairy to remain on the farm which seems to be what folks in Norwich and the neighborhood would like to see happen,” Moulton wrote. 
In emails, she asked McIntyre to assign its option to purchase the property from the college to the creamery instead, in exchange for being reimbursed for the expenses incurred to date. The land trust would be able to purchase the property from the creamery for $50,000 in the future if the creamery ceased agricultural operations at the site. The creamery would be able to negotiate with the land trust on using the conserved land for agricultural operations. 
Moulton said keeping the site a working farm was “consistent with the spirit of the gift from the Siglers.” (Sigler, who died in 2021, apparently wanted nothing to do with the controversy. “Not my problem,” he told Jim Kenyon, a Valley News Columnist, according to a 2021 obituary.)
The proposal appeared to be a three-way win. It gave the land trust the option to purchase the property in the future while avoiding landlord responsibilities for the creamery. It gave the college the opportunity to divest but continue to conduct workshops and educational operations on the farm. The Grays would own their own farm, and if they decided to leave, the option would again transfer to the trust. Moulton asked for the three parties to get together as soon as possible. 
The land trust said such an arrangement wasn’t possible. McIntyre told VTDigger that, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the trust couldn’t legally provide public benefits to private individuals like the Grays. In the 2018 emails, McIntyre wrote that she’d previously explained “the legal, ethical and strategic reasons why we felt it was unlikely UVLT’s Board would accept.” (In a 2025 email, Stan Williams, board chair, told Brown that the trust had a “fiduciary duty” to exercise the option to purchase the land after the college withdrew.)
Moulton said she was “very sorry to hear this.” A little more than a week later, Moulton wrote another email reminding McIntyre that the college supported the creamery remaining on the farm. She mentioned a recent post on the land trust’s website called “Bringing the Cows Back” that stated: “We hope that the increased visibility for the Norwich Farm Creamery and the growing public awareness of operating complexities at the site will help the Grays strengthen the Creamery finances and, if viable, bring back the cows!”
Moulton offered to clear her calendar to make time in the next week for a resolution and suggested finding a mediator to advance the process. But McIntyre said the land trust’s attorneys didn’t want them having direct contact with Chris Gray.
Brown said officials at the college fought for the creamery and offered a long-term lease because they knew the business was never going to own land in Vermont. “The reality is we’re not wealthy people,” Gray added. “We don’t have money to burn to create some fantasy.”
A value-added dairy business is hard to make a go of in New England, according to Lee Robie, a 76-year-old, fifth generation former dairy farmer at New Hampshire’s Robie Farm. His family transitioned years ago from a conventional dairy into a value-added dairy business with cheese making, raw milk and a farm store.
“I can’t say we’re rolling in the dough, but we do sell a lot of products in New Hampshire and Vermont and we employ quite a few people on the farm,” Robie said in an interview. Years ago, he sold some of his farm’s lease rights to a land trust. While his family considered the Upper Valley Land Trust, they eventually went with Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust because it encouraged the family to keep farming and develop its agritourism business, Robie said.
By May 2018, after a spat over the use of a classroom on the farm for a celebration of Dale Somerville’s life, the former owner of the farm, to which the Grays say they were not invited, McIntyre told Moulton in an email that the trust’s “goodwill in this matter is nearly exhausted.” In a later email, McIntyre noted that the land trust had twice extended the closing of the option to benefit the college. “It is increasingly difficult for me to respond to VTC requests for goodwill, as these delays damage UVLT,” McIntyre wrote. 
The settlement
Representatives of the college and the land trust spoke with a mediator in June 2018, but the proposal put forward by Moulton ultimately failed. Almost a year later, the college still hadn’t delivered the land without the Grays. So the land trust sued the college.
The lawsuit appeared to change the way the college approached the Grays. A settlement was reached in 2020, after which the college listed the property for sale. The Grays would need to vacate the property when their five-year lease terminated on June 30, 2021.
McIntyre said the lawsuit in April 2019 only came after discussing for a year how to resolve the situation. The land trust never had any legal obligation or legal ability to help the Grays, according to McIntyre, and she said she didn’t know why the college claimed that the land trust could transfer the option. 
“We’re a private charity, it’s not the same thing as a publicly funded institution, so maybe they just didn’t know we’d have these constraints because it’s not the world they live in,” McIntyre said. 
But the Grays remained convinced that the land trust could have done more. While the college and the land trust negotiated their lawsuit, the Grays mobilized their neighbors into forming the Norwich Farm Foundation, a nonprofit with goals of maintaining local food security, creating affordable farmer housing, preserving the working landscape and restoring regenerative agriculture. The group submitted a ten-year business plan for the creamery to the land trust that included producing 350,000 pounds of dairy products each year. It hinged on grazing cattle on the surrounding pastureland in the Brookmead Conservation Area, owned by the land trust. 
But McIntyre said, by that point, the land trust didn’t need to see a plan, because it wasn’t going to own the six-acre property. The plan the trust did receive in May 2020 was very similar to the initial 2018 plan it received from the Grays, McIntyre said, except this time the Grays wouldn’t pay rent and would receive a salary. 
As McIntyre repeatedly told the creamery and said in public commentary, the land was not available to the Grays’ business. The college listed the six-acre property for $1.25 million. The Grays, bolstered by the enormous wealth of the Norwich community and desperate to maintain their business, managed to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the property through the foundation. 
It took months, but finally, in the spring of 2020, the foundation submitted an unsolicited offer through email to buy the property for $300,000, according to Omer Trajman, then treasurer of the Norwich Farm Foundation, who spoke to lawmakers during a March 2021 Senate Agriculture Committee meeting that was held on Zoom and included the parties involved in the dispute. When that failed, the foundation raised an additional $180,000 and doubled its offer to $610,000. The college again rejected the offer. (Trajman did not respond to requests for comment.)
“We all sort of had high hopes and great ideas about that operation and know that the people in Norwich certainly enjoy having that farm there,” Sen. Robert Starr, D-Orleans, said during the 2021 committee meeting.
But Moulton, also in attendance, no longer appeared interested in supporting the Grays. She told lawmakers that the college had been clear with the Grays that their plan to make Norwich Farm their dairy operation was no longer going to work. The barn was not ideally set up for milking, and was instead better positioned to raise prize Holsteins, she said. Because they didn’t have access to surrounding pastures, feed would have to be trucked in and manure trucked out, she said.
“That’s not the way you typically do dairy farming,” Moulton said as McIntyre nodded along to her comments on the Zoom screen. 
Gray put in over half a million dollars in the dairy he told lawmakers in 2021. He told VTDigger his family paid over $80,000 in legal bills to maintain their rights on the property. (Gray later said that he received pro bono representation and saved money from ballooning legal costs by working with the Vermont Legal Food Hub at the Vermont Law and Graduate School.) 
The tension on the Zoom call was palpable. Gray shook his head and looked appalled at McIntyre and Moulton’s statements. McIntyre shook her head and appeared to laugh at Gray. 
Moulton said the only offer on the farm as of March 2021 was from the Norwich Farm Foundation, but that it was far below fair market value. She said the college spent around $70,000 a year subsidizing the farm’s operating expenses, which came from the students’ tuition. The college plowed the driveway, mowed the fields, and emptied the grey water produced by the creamery, Moulton said. In the last several years, between renovation and operation, the college system had spent “several million dollars” on the property, Moulton said.
If the college sold the property, asked Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, would the money go directly to the college system’s budget?
“Yes,” Moulton said, nodding. The sale could provide 25-50 student scholarships, she added.
Between the foundation’s first offer in 2020 and the end of 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation made at least five offers for the property to the college, which rejected them all, according to the Grays. In May of 2021, the Grays sued the college for $500,000. The lawsuit was settled in mediation, the Grays said. By early September, the college filed an eviction notice against the Grays. The family contested it, and in April 2022, settled with the college for $10,000.
But in the middle of the fight over the eviction, the foundation raised $400,000 from the community, according to the Grays. In December 2021, the foundation was finally able to buy the property from the college for $1,065,000. The foundation bought the property so the Grays could continue operating the Norwich Farm Creamery, making an operating dairy again viable in the community. 
But much of the money the foundation spent on the property did not go to the college system or to student scholarships, as the Grays and their neighbors had assumed after the 2021 Senate testimony. The details of the private settlement between the college and the land trust became unredacted after the sale went through. Under that settlement, the trust had earned $849,674. Those hundreds of thousands of dollars would “advance UVLT’s conservation and stewardship missions,” according to a 2022 annual report.
The purchase left the Norwich Farm Foundation with an almost equivalent $850,000 mortgage debt. 
“The Upper Valley Land Trust took all the money,” Gray said. “In the end, UVLT created $850,000 in debt and profited from a farm that was originally given away.” 
Moulton confirmed in an email that “money from the sale of the Norwich Farm did not go into scholarships” or students at the college. She said she couldn’t speak to where the money ultimately ended up because she left the college in 2023. 
The settlement, unsealed and then unredacted through multiple public records requests, showed that the land trust received an initial $75,000 and then played a role in the sale, choosing the broker for the sale who would recommend the pricing. 
McIntyre told VTDigger that the $75,000 was compensation for “real out-of-pocket costs we incurred,” including the staff time reaching out to potential tenants and the analyses of business plans for the property. 
But the Grays brought up other issues: The land trust was able to reject offers for the six-acre property under $500,000 and match any offer less than $450,000 after a three-month veto period, according to the settlement. In 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation alleged that the trust had been involved in the sale and driven up the costs.
McIntyre stands by a claim she’s made for years that she never saw or evaluated any of the offers the college received: “UVLT had absolutely nothing to do with whatever offers the college rejected,” McIntyre said in October. While who saw what remains an open question, the settlement makes clear that the land trust received 100% of the first $450,000 and 70% of any net sale proceeds over $450,000.
That means the land trust — with a stated mission to permanently protect land in the Upper Valley, including working farms — reaped more than 18 times the original $50,000 trigger option it would have paid the college for the six-acre property. But McIntyre said this settlement was just about recouping financial losses for the failure of the college to deliver the property as initially promised. 
“UVLT did not make money,” McIntyre told VTDigger, adding that the trust was  only paid 80 percent of the value of the property that should’ve been conveyed to the trust by the college. “We were damaged, and we were compensated for the loss of opportunity caused by the school’s default.”
“We have nothing to do with the property where the Grays are located now,” McIntyre said in August. “Their business, from what I gather, is not working out.” 
The debt
From his kitchen table in June, Gray said his family was “crushed financially” by the debacle. The foundation’s debt is more than a million dollars, according to foreclosure documents. The foundation can’t make enough money from the creamery, which relies on hauling in milk instead of milking dairy cows, to pay back the debt without access to the land or larger donors, Gray said. 
The Grays’ faced another defeat in 2023 when they tried and failed to get a property tax exemption for the property valued at $1.239 million, according to the property’s town tax bill. The town of Norwich decided the for-profit business operation within the non-profit status of the Norwich Farm Foundation didn’t meet the standard of the land used for a charitable purpose. The annual taxes on the property are more than $34,000.
The foundation disbanded after realizing the debt for the property they purchased was untenable. None responded to a request for comment or agreed to speak on the record. Kate Barlow, the former president of the foundation, said in a September email that it had been more than three years since she was on the board and requested not to be contacted.
The foundation listed the property a year ago for $1.275 million. Failing to secure any offers, let alone a buyer, the foundation took it off the market Sept. 1.
That was more than a month after the foreclosure began. 
The $850,000 mortgage has been held by Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT, a farmland finance company out of Illinois, since May 2022. In July, the company filed a foreclosure notice against the foundation, Norwich Farm Creamery and Brown and Gray themselves, according to court records. The notice says the parties now owe $1,065,000, or roughly what the foundation initially paid for the property with accumulated taxes, interest and attorney fees, according to court records. 
After a foreclosure notice, defendants can often work to pay off the debt during a redemption period. In Vermont, that period is typically six months for farms, but Iroquois Valley argued last month that the property was not actually farmland, but rather a commercial property taxed by the town of Norwich. Therefore, the finance company requested a redemption period of one day. 
Eventually, the foreclosure could mean bankruptcy and eviction, according to Gray. He said the couple could close their value-added dairy business by the end of the year. 
“We do not know at this point exactly how long that process will take or ultimately what will be the outcome for our business and our family,” Gray said in August.

The Grays continue to place most of the blame on UVLT for subdividing the working farm – hewing the working land from the working infrastructure. They’d fundraised to buy the property on the presumption that the money they were spending would support the state college, the Grays said, and according to the Senate agricultural committee meeting, go to student scholarships. They blamed the realization that the money had instead gone to the land trust on sidelining much of their fundraising efforts.
“All the money we raised, and all the money we continued to raise, just went to servicing the debt and keeping the lights on, so zero money went back to growing the system and getting it to a sustainable level. It’s what happens to all farms. They just get in so much debt, then they can’t grow and be sustainable,” Gray said. 
Brown now works a second job in retail at King Arthur Baking Company. The farm is currently processing about 175 gallons of milk a week purchased from Billings Farm and Museum in Woodstock, according to Gray. Their gross revenues are about $200,000 a year, according to their farm plan.
The couple has stopped paying the mortgage and taxes on the property. Gray said the creamery is still in production but the finances are week to week while the family looks for a new backer for the business.
“The situation is so complicated,” Gray said from his kitchen, looking grim. “And the money has become so big that it’s hard to get anyone to pay attention. And you have no access to the land.”
When asked about UVLT not allowing the Grays to use the surrounding 350 acres for agriculture, McIntyre said the land was always intended for conservation purposes and had never been available to the Grays’ private business.
“The Grays have known for years that it won’t be available to their operation. They knew that before they got there. Before the foundation bought it for them,” McIntyre said. “UVLT was not going to subsidize a business or tie up our property in an unsustainable plan.” 
The Grays’ daughter, Eugenia, five years old at the start of this saga, is now 15 and in high school near Norwich. The couple said they want to stay in the community for her education and because the farm is important to their family. 
“We don’t have any other options,” Brown said. “We don’t have any place to go.” 
So the creamery is making a last ditch effort to bring in another partner: Dartmouth College.
The couple is asking for an investment of about $2.5 million for ownership of the property. They’ve shared a five-year growth plan that involves returning cows to the farm, hiring two herd managers, tripling production and becoming financially self-sustaining after five years. 
They said they’ve received positive feedback, but the college’s real estate office isn’t yet interested in buying the property. Dartmouth College declined to comment.
But they’re not giving up: They pitched rebranding the business as Dartmouth Farm Creamery.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 23, 2025.
The Vermont Public Utility Commission officially opened an investigation into Hyde Park Electric on Monday after the village utility admitted to the state last month that it was experiencing “significant financial distress.”
Hyde Park Electric, which serves 1,400 ratepayers, has failed to cover expenses as it struggles under the weight of its $1.5 million debt, and is “essentially not solvent,” according to correspondence between the state and the utility.
The Department of Public Service, which advocates on behalf of Vermont ratepayers, learned about the severity of the village utility’s situation only after another state program informed  commissioner Kerrick Johnson that Hyde Park Electric had not been paying its bills.
After a meeting in Montpelier held Sept. 9, Johnson laid out his directives for addressing the situation in a letter to Hyde Park village manager Brian Evans-Mongeon on how to proceed in addressing a catastrophic situation that was “entirely of its own making.” Kerrick admonished the utility for failing to inform the state of its dire situation “months if not years ago.”
Johnson outlined concerns including the utility’s use of loans taken out by the village to cover losses incurred by the electric department; various loans that the utility had fallen behind on; and the handling of energy efficiency charge collections, which the utility had been using to cover other costs, rather than sending them on to the state as required.
“The Department continues to weigh all options relative to our view on whether Hyde Park Electric’s continued operation is the most efficient means of ensuring reliable, affordable and sustainable electric service to its ratepayers,” Johnson wrote. He later clarified that it is still his department’s position that the existence of a solvent village utility would be the best outcome for ratepayers.
In a subsequent letter to the Public Utility Commission filed on Sept. 29 at the behest of the Department of Public Service, Evans-Mongeon and village trustees chair Fredericka French told regulators that the department had unpaid transmission bills outstanding, along with other suspect financially unsound transactions that had resulted in a “negative retained earnings and a negative net income position.”
They promised that the utility, after contracting with the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, would be cooperating fully with the state to right the ship.
“(Hyde Park Electric) understands the gravity of this situation and is endeavoring to restore (the utility’s) financial footing and assuring that its public service obligations are fully met,” the letter from the Hyde Park officials said.
In a follow-up interview, French pledged that there would be no interruption to electricity access in Hyde Park village, an assertion that Johnson corroborated.
Johnson said his department’s first priority was to work with Hyde Park Electric to propose a new rate increase that would allow the utility to stabilize itself financially while his department maintains strict financial surveillance going forward. But how, exactly, the Hyde Park board of trustees got itself into this mess remains a mystery.
French said that this was purely a matter of financial mismanagement, not fraud, while Johnson awaits the result of a VPPSA audit to adequately apportion blame, to “untangle in terms of responsibility and how and when we got here.”
Johnson said he had seen other municipal utilities face financial struggles, but Hyde Park’s insolvency is extraordinary.
“There’s been nothing like this where there’s been a series of utility management decisions over a period of time, especially the legally questionable, regulatory questionable, practices and measures and strategies undertaken,” he said. “This is not just doubling down; this is quadrupling down of debt and mismanagement that have brought the utility to its current position.”
Crisis unveiled
Shortly after Johnson was appointed to the Department of Public Service, he attended a regular February meeting of the Hyde Park village board of trustees with an offer of collaboration with the utility, with which he had concerns, but received no interest from the village.
As laid out in the public utility commission’s filing on Monday, Hyde Park Electric had been requesting rate increases that the commission believed “were insufficient to meet its operating needs.” The utility last filed for a rate increase of 2% in October 2023 and promised to return with another increase request the following spring, but didn’t.
In September, representatives from Efficiency Vermont reached out to Johnson for guidance when Hyde Park Electric, in what they say was an unprecedented situation, had not paid the remittance the utilities regularly pay the program.
Evans-Mongeon and the trustees met with Johnson in Montpelier in a “tense” meeting during which the utility ultimately admitted to being insolvent. According to Johnson, it took some discussion to get to that point.
“There was evasiveness, evasiveness and finger-pointing to anyone but themselves at first, and that was dismissed summarily, and (we) started to get, at last, an acknowledgement of the depth of the problem,” he said.
According to Johnson, along with being behind on various payments and in serious debt, the village had been covering the debt with loans it had taken out and had been commingling electric utility funds with its water and sewer utility.
In 2022, Lamoille County sued Hyde Park village for changing its water and sewer rate structure to protect residential customers while increasing the rate for state and county-owned buildings like the courthouse and elementary school from a $15 flat fee to $1,418 base charge. The county and village eventually settled on a slightly lesser fee.
This water and sewer rate adjustment was presided over by former Hyde Park village manager Carol Robertson. Robertson suddenly left her position in the spring of 2023 after developing serious medical issues and died that April, according to an announcement made by French. Evans-Mongeon took the job that same year.
Johnson said it’s unclear at this time how far back the mismanagement of Hyde Park Electric’s resources goes. French said past and current management practices would be scrutinized in the ongoing VPPSA audit.
A separate independent audit conducted by a St. Albans-based accounting firm Kittell Branagan & Sargent submitted to the village on Oct. 10 included comments complaining of significant delays in the auditing process due to a lack of documentation and accused management of not possessing “the expertise in financial accounting and reporting in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
State takes charge
Hyde Park Electric was already being investigated by the Public Utility Commission after implementing a new rate tariff for infrastructure upgrade costs that the commission felt it needed to better explain. The Department of Public Service pushed Hyde Park to abandon this request, filing a scathing motion to dismiss, instead of waiting for the trustees to make a decision.
It was a move that one of Hyde Park’s lawyers with Stackpole & French said, in an email to department lawyers, felt like the department was “just trying to kick HPE while they are down and took an opportunity to take another shot at them.” Ed French, senior partner at the law firm, is Fredericka French’s husband.
Johnson said the tenor of that initial meeting and Hyde Park Electric’s record of resisting cooperation with the state caused him to grow impatient.
“There’s fundamental cracks in the foundation of your house, and you’re doing new window treatments,” Johnson said of the rate tariff. “Stop it. Concentrate on the financial fundamentals. That’s where you should be concentrating on re-earning trust for your management team with the Department of Public Service.”
On Oct. 16, the Department of Public Service sent a proposed two-phase rate case process to Hyde Park, a plan that, as enacted, will stabilize the utility in the short-term.
The next part of the process will require the utility, under surveillance by the department and with the support of VPPSA, to submit a rate increase proposal that will allow it to achieve some form of long-term financial stability. Johnson said the rate increase will be substantial, but not “the most expensive rates in the state.”
A solvent Hyde Park Electric is still what Johnson believes will ultimately be best for its ratepayers, but dissolution is still on the table.
“It shouldn’t have taken a third party knocking on the department door that tipped us off to exactly the depth of the financial challenges that (they) are facing,” he said, “but the village and the leadership there have a responsibility towards its own rate payers as well as to the rest of the state’s rate-payers, to look for assistance when they need it.”

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The 19 proposals advanced on Wednesday by a legislative task force aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners are a mix of ideas including spending cuts, increases in other taxes and tapping into other funds.
In addition to recommendations by the task force, lawmakers will likely have to contend with other property tax proposals when they convene for the annual legislative session in January. That could include a revival of a state sales tax rate increase from 4.2% to 5% and the governor’s proposed optional half-percent sales tax for counties, which currently don’t have authority to tax sales (only the state and cities have that power).
Lawmakers on the task force expressed a hope in June to propose legislation that will significantly cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes. South Dakota property taxes paid by homeowners increased 38.8% between 2020 and 2024.
The proposals include cutting state spending and applying the savings to property tax relief, replacing some property tax revenue with sales tax increases, using one-time tax credits for temporary relief, and reserving a portion of future state revenue increases each year to reduce property taxes.
Chair of the task force and Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said details need to be hashed out with some of the proposals. Task force member and Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, cautioned lawmakers at the end of the meeting.
“We need to be very careful about what we wish for,” Deibert said. “If we lower our property taxes so much, we’ll have more people moving here and have a big impact on that. We have to be very careful on that balance, to keep our quality of life and not be overrun by people moving here because we have such a great tax environment.”
Cut state spending by 5%
The most contentious proposal to make it through the task force is cutting state government general fund spending by 5%, or about $123 million — with cooperation from Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration to identify where potential cuts could be made. The cuts themselves wouldn’t reduce property taxes, because the state doesn’t receive any property tax revenue (only counties, schools, cities and other local governments do). The state would have to dedicate the savings toward property tax relief.
Task force Vice Chair and House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said the executive branch’s cooperation is needed to “cut state government in this fashion.” 
“I think the fundamental reason for this request is because, if we want real tax relief, it must come from cuts to government spending,” said Hansen, who is running for governor next year. “Otherwise, we’re just shifting the burden onto other taxpayers.”
Other members of the task force and the public warned task force members against state cuts. Jim Terwilliger, commissioner of the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management, said many of the budget cuts proposed by the Rhoden administration for this fiscal year were unpopular with lawmakers, and some of them were restored.
“It’s pretty easy to say, ‘Oh, let’s go cut 5%,’” Terwilliger said, adding, “I think it’s going to be very, very difficult to do that at the end of the day.”
Reserve some future revenue growth for property tax relief
Another recommendation would create a new property tax relief fund by depositing 25% of the annual increase in ongoing state revenue into the fund each year.
The idea, proposed by Karr, would be a long-term investment in property tax relief, he said.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said it would be a new line item in the state budget and grow each year. Karr compared the idea to annual increases in state employee salaries, education and Medicaid reimbursements. 
“Even with an average of 4% growth, we can have a significant buildup,” Karr said, adding, “Maybe this is the seed we plant for future growth in property tax relief.”
Sales tax increase used for property tax relief
The task force also advanced a proposal to use a sales tax increase from 4.2% to 4.5% to create a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts. A temporary sales tax reduction from 4.5% to 4.2%, adopted in 2023, is already scheduled to expire in 2027 unless lawmakers make it permanent.
South Dakota Retailers Association Executive Director Nathan Sanderson encouraged lawmakers to support the idea, saying that his organization has been advocating for the “relatively simple” proposal since 2022.
One-time $500 tax credits
A $500 property tax credit for owner-occupied properties would be funded by remaining Housing and Infrastructure Financing program money and budget reserve funding, totaling $120 million.

Lawmakers used a combination of state and federal funding in 2023 to create a $200 million Housing and Infrastructure Financing program, meant to spur housing developments across South Dakota. Much of that money has been spent as grants, but just under $65 million in loans remain untouched. The Legislature earlier this year dipped into the fund to spend $15 million on a loan for the Douglas School District, serving the Ellsworth Air  Force Base, to help build an elementary school.
Hansen proposed spending the remaining funds on property tax relief. On Friday, the governor unveiled a rival proposal to spend some of the the remaining housing infrastructure money on airport expansions in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
Julie Johnson, a lobbyist who represents various housing groups, said many organizations have proposals in the works to use the remainder of the Housing and Infrastructure Financing money.
“I would urge your avoidance of that fund,” Johnson said. “It’s filled incredible niches in the housing infrastructure economy and allowed a lot of communities to take the next steps into building their own opportunities.”
Tax increment financing regulations
One of the most controversial proposals related to property taxes is Howard’s tax increment financing district regulation package.
Local tax increment financing districts provide upfront financing to build streets, water pipes and other infrastructure for development, while capturing the higher property taxes generated by the development to pay off the financing over time. TIFs, as they are known, have become controversial in some areas, including Rapid City, where critics including Howard allege they’ve become handouts for wealthy developers.

If passed, Howard’s proposal would restrict TIFs by reducing the percentage of a city or county’s overall assessed value that can be part of a TIF, requiring that at least 50% of the area within a proposed TIF district be blighted, redefining “blight,” requiring counties to approve TIF districts established by a city, requiring an independent evaluation that a project would not be built unless a TIF was established, and requiring a special election for TIF districts totaling $10 million or more.
Howard called the changes “common sense” as TIFs become a more commonly used tool, especially in urban counties, to “reign it back.”
Other task force members, including Deibert, were concerned the package is too restrictive and would harm communities. Deibert and other critics conceded that TIFs could be further regulated in the state, but without “punishing people who really need” them.
The impact of TIFs on local property taxpayers is a subject of debate, with critics saying the capturing of a project’s property taxes to pay off TIF financing temporarily burdens other taxpayers, while TIF proponents say TIFs spur development that broadens the tax base over time.
Other proposals
Other proposals advanced by the task force:

Expanding the state’s property assessment freeze program income limit for older and disabled South Dakotans.
Requiring counties to include a QR code on property tax bills to direct taxpayers to the state’s property tax website, in an effort to increase transparency about how property taxes are used.
Setting school districts’ annual increase for property tax revenue at the same level as all other taxing districts, since school districts are currently exempt.
Allowing property owners applying for tax relief programs to fill out forms online, rather than at the county office.
Raising the minimum value of a new structure or addition that qualifies for the discretionary formula, a property tax incentive to promote economic development in the state, from $30,000 to $100,000. 
Creating a new fund directing all state lottery revenues to state aid for education, rather than placing the revenues into the state general fund.
Prohibiting a school district from transferring money from its capital outlay fund to its general fund, as well as limiting annual increases in a school district’s capital outlay property taxes to 3% or inflation, whichever is less, and removing additional increases allowed from growth.
Expanding the state’s property tax relief program for disabled veterans by increasing the maximum exempt assessed value to the entire assessed value of the property, and offering a refund of property taxes to eligible South Dakotans who qualify but did not apply in the last five years of eligibility.
Allowing more cities to implement a property tax rebate program for owner-occupied properties, such as the one in Sioux Falls, which has such a program in place because it has a unique charter, called home rule, allowing more autonomy in its governance.
Restricting school district opt outs (decisions to exceed state-imposed limits on property tax revenue growth), by making it easier to bring an opt out to a vote of the people by automatic referral, decreasing signature requirements for referral, requiring 60% approval, or increasing the number of days opponents have to gather petition signatures to force a referral.
Creating a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts, using any sources of revenue lawmakers put toward the fund.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Oct. 23, 2025.
Stowe’s Visitor Center was a foliage hotspot this season.
More than 10,000 people have entered the visitor center so far in October, compared with 6,500 for the entire month last year, according to guest services coordinator Adrianne Johnson, who said visits have been up all year. The visitor center also doubled its previous one-day visitation record — 581 last year to 1,148 this year.
Those visitors traveled from nearly every continent, with people coming from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Greenland, China, Japan, India and Sudan, according to Johnson.
Dispelling notions that Canadian visitors aren’t visiting Stowe, Johnson said the visitor center has seen many tourists from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, as well as a few first-time visitors from the western provinces.
On any given weekend this month, a line of leaf peepers has snaked through the visitor center toward the bathroom and front desk, behind which Johnson and her colleagues have done their best to answer a litany of questions about Stowe. While the questions may seem similar, each set of guests is unique, according to Johnson.
“They want to know the best photo spots, where they should shop, which of the trails they should hike for the best colors and best views, or the most accessible ways to experience Stowe beyond scenic drives and shopping downtown,” Johnson said. “Sometimes they have no idea what they should do and other times they aren’t sure they can do all they have planned.”
The gondola skyride and auto toll road at Stowe Mountain Resort and the von Trapp Family Lodge are among the most popular destinations for people who pass through the visitor center, Johnson said.
This time of year, roadways and trails with foliage views are also popular. A lot of people are interested in traveling Smugglers Notch, or Stowe’s gravel roads with covered bridges. The Stowe Recreation Path and Cady Hill mountain bike trails attract recreationists.

According to Johnson, Stowe history was another popular topic this foliage season.
The visitor center sends history buffs over to Stowe Historical Society, the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum, Stowe at Night Lantern Tours and the self-guided hiking tour of historic sites in Sterling Forest.
Johnson and her colleagues give food and beverage recommendations as well.

From frontline service providers to statewide advocacy groups, many organizations that anchor our communities are now fighting to survive. And while headlines often focus on executive leadership, we should be equally attentive to the role of governing boards.
2025 is a historically challenging year for nonprofits, and the road ahead looks far from easy. A combination of federal funding cuts, rising costs fueled by tariffs, and continued attacks on diversity and inclusion initiatives have created a perfect storm of instability. Here in Colorado, where nonprofits generate more than $62 billion in revenue, employ 182,000 Coloradans, and support 80,000 contractors, the stakes couldn’t be higher.
The numbers tell a sobering story.

According to the Nonprofit Finance Fund, 52% of nonprofits have three months or less of cash on hand, and 36% ended 2024 operating at a deficit — the highest rate in a decade. Candid data warns that more than 14,000 organizations could run out of cash within months if funding continues to dry up, threatening millions of jobs and countless services.
In moments like these, attention often turns to the executive director or CEO. Exceptional leaders can unite teams, weather uncertainty, and even help their organizations thrive under pressure. But sustaining mission-driven work in a turbulent environment requires more than strong executives — it demands exceptional boards.
Too often, the nonprofit sector overlooks how critical strong boards are to long-term success. Board performance varies widely, and two issues tend to drive that variation:


Recruiting and retaining directors with the right mix of skills, lived experience, and resources


Building governance systems that actually harness those strengths to set direction, oversee performance, and ensure accountability


Finding board members who bring that balance can feel like hunting for unicorns. Many boards overemphasize one area — like fundraising — while neglecting community representation or relevant expertise. On top of that, nonprofits must fill unpaid roles, often expecting personal contributions, while operating on limited budgets and minimal staff support. It’s no surprise that even high-functioning organizations struggle to assemble “best-in-class” boards.
And even when nonprofits recruit talented directors, ideal composition doesn’t always translate to effective governance. As governance expert Dr. John Carver once observed, “Nonprofit boards are often groups of highly competent and responsible people who, as a group, are neither competent nor responsible.”
That paradox points to a deeper need: building systems that promote group competence. Boards need clear standards for performance, transparent accountability to the communities they serve, and structures that empower — not micromanage — staff.
The takeaway is simple but urgent: Nonprofits must approach board recruitment and engagement with far greater intentionality. With the right mix of skills, representation and training, boards can transform from passive fiduciaries into strategic partners helping organizations navigate this moment of volatility.
There’s also good news. Adversity breeds opportunity, and Colorado is filled with talented, civic-minded professionals who want to make a difference. Serving on a nonprofit board offers a chance to address real-world challenges — from housing affordability to early childhood education to climate resilience — while developing leadership skills and broadening one’s perspective.
For nonprofits, this is the moment to take a hard look at how their boards operate. Revisiting officer and committee roles, clarifying expectations, and strengthening the board’s role as both a strategic visionary and a hands-on partner can turn governance into a true engine of resilience.
Colorado has always prided itself on community — neighbors stepping up for one another, across divides and across the mountains. As the nonprofit sector faces one of its most challenging chapters in decades, that spirit of service and collaboration must extend to the boardroom.
The way forward may not be easy, but it is clear: We need more Coloradans to step into governance, strategy and stewardship — and we need to equip them to lead effectively together. Nonprofits that do will be the ones that not only survive the current turbulence, but emerge stronger, more inclusive, and better prepared to serve the people who count on them most.

And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.
The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?
Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.
“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.
“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.
But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.
DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.
But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.
“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.
The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated.Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president, Oceantic
Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.
“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said. 
Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.
“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“ 
But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.
“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.
 “We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.
“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.
If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.
But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.
How dead is offshore wind?
Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.
“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.
“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”
Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.
Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.
“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”
Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.
A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes. 

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.
A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”
“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.
He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.
“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.
“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.
“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.
“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.
Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.
“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.
“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.
The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.
In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.
Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.
Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.
Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”
What about solar?
Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.
But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.
Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.
Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us.Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport
New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.
It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.
“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”
Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.
Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.
It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.
“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.
“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.
Massachusetts is already doing that.
“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.
Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank. 
“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”
She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”
DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.
In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.
Solutions
Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions. 
“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.
She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”
Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.
“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.   
If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.
“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.
Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.
“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”
Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway. 
“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”
In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.
The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.
But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue. 
“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.
Dykes sees the same challenge. 
“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”
The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wind-Turbine-Towers-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-26 05:16:39.133693

It was made by G.S. Smallwood of Chicago. (Library of Congress)When it came time for John Seybold to place the ring on his bride’s finger, he was given a warning: he must not touch any other part of her body or risk death.
That should have been enough to alert the 71-year-old retired Kansas farmer that things were not as they seemed, but love does weird things to people. He proceeded with the ceremony, held in a darkened séance room, and later sat during a festive wedding dinner next to an empty chair reserved for his spectral bride.
Seybold was in love with “Sarah,” the ghost of a girl he had known in his youth back in Ohio, and he trusted the spirit medium who had summoned her from the great beyond.
The medium, 36-year-old Nellie Moore, had been holding classes in spiritualism in Wichita for the curious and the credulous. She had introduced others to their ethereal soulmates, but being matchmaker to Seybold and his gossamer love had been a singular achievement.
She had enjoyed material benefits from her association with the lonely farmer, who had come to her two years before from Liberal and asked to make contact with his long-dead son. In a darkened room with black curtains and a wardrobe that produced such wonders as spirit photos and floating luminous stars, Moore had done just that.
Or at least Seybold thought she had.
Soon, Moore had a new car and furniture and even deeds to the farms Seybold owned, one near Liberal, a couple of hundred miles away in southwestern Kansas, and another across the state line in Oklahoma.
When it finally dawned on Seybold that he’d been taken for his life savings, he did what many disappointed spouses do: He sued. The case must have been one of the strangest ever to come before a Wichita judge, and it made headlines across the country.
“She was really after his money,” author and historian of the strange Tim Shepard told me. “When it was all over, she got him for $7,500.”
Because I’m a diurnal skeptic when it comes to paranormal activity — my answer changes according to how often things go bump in the night — I asked Shepard for his take on Wichita’s “ghost bride” case.
Shepard is the author of two books of Kansas ghost stories, the most recent of which is “Return to the Prairie: More Tales of History and Hauntings.” He’s working on a forthcoming book about hauntings along Route 66, and as research for that book he drove the length of the mother road in a 1934 Hudson Terraplane. He’s given ghost tours across the state, worked at the Red Rocks State Historic Site at Emporia, and at 52 says he’s considered the grandfather of ghost hunting in Kansas.
“Moore’s tactics were very similar to what most spiritualists were doing in the late 1800s,” Shepard said. “The room she held her séances in was painted black, with black curtains, a large wardrobe, and a couple of chairs. She actually told him not to touch the spirits because if he did both he and she would die. Based on the details he gave of meeting Sarah, there was probably somebody hidden in the cabinet.”
At one séance, Moore was instructed to write a $500 check to an organization for wayward girls. He did so, Shepard said, and an otherworldly hand took the check.
While Seybold’s actions may seem foolish now, he seems to have had a serious interest in spiritualism, a belief system that holds the soul survives death and spirits of the dead can communicate with the living.
It all began with the Fox Sisters in western New York in the 1840s, who claimed they could communicate through raps and knocks with the spirit of a murdered peddler. The sisters were soon demonstrating spirit communication at public events that drew hundreds, dividing the press and the public on whether they were genuinely in touch with the spirit world or youthful hoaxers seeking money and attention.
During and after the Civil War, spiritualism surged in popularity. The bloodiest conflict in American history drove many to the comforting belief that they could communicate with their beloved dead. Even Mary Todd Lincoln held séances at the White House. Years after the war, the last photograph taken of Mrs. Lincoln contributed to another spiritualist-related craze, spirit photography. A photo by Boston photographer William Mumler purports to show the ghost of Abraham Lincoln looking kindly down upon her, hands on her shoulders. But it was a cheap photographic trick relying on a double exposure.
Spiritualism was not just a fad in Victorian American, but a serious societal and political movement. The first woman to run for president was Victoria Woodhull, a trance medium and “free love” radical. Kate Bender, of the murderous Bender Family of Kansas, also claimed to be one. While some mediums were perpetrating hoaxes on their credulous victims, often with the use of mechanical tricks such as the magic slate tablet, there were millions of Americans who embraced spiritualism as proof of life after death.
After the First World War, the movement gained renewed popularity. Its chief proponent was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Despite having created the epitome of the rational detective and being trained as a medical doctor, Doyle was gullible and proclaimed his belief in spirits, including the now-debunked Cottingley Fairies photos.
If Doyle was the champion of mediumship, Harry Houdini was its nemesis. The world-famous magician and escape artist (and friend of Doyle’s) spent much of his career campaigning against charlatanism. He devoted himself to exposing the tricks used by fake mediums. Houdini was an expert in those tricks, because he and his wife Bess had started their careers by using them.
In November 1897, they had appeared at the opera house in Garnett, Kansas, promising to name the killer of a recently murdered local woman. Houdini had already demonstrated an escape from the local jail, according to “The Secret Life of Houdini” by William Kalush and Larry Sloman. Bess had been promoted as a “psychometric clairvoyant” and her séances with Houdini were a hit. But it was all trickery, and in Garnett, according to the authors, Bess feigned a swoon at the climactic moment to avoid actually naming the murderer.
In addition to tricks like the spirit slates, charlatans used rhetorical sleight-of-hand. If a medium failed to materialize a spirit it was because there were unbelievers present. Some, like Nellie Moore, claimed they couldn’t remember anything while under control of spirits. If Seybold’s dead son or the ghost of “Sarah” told the old farmer to do things, such as take $3,000 out of the bank to give to her, she would just have to take other people’s word for it.
“During the wedding ceremony,” Shepard said, “he actually places a diamond ring on the ghost’s finger. And he said it felt solid.” But the old man was so fearful of dying from touching the ghost that he dared not embrace his bride.
Seybold, who had two previous marriages to living women, moved from Liberal to Wichita to be close to his medium and was directed to deed all of his property to her. When the aging farmer said he wanted to consult an attorney, Moore produced the ghost of Samuel B. Amidon, a recently deceased Wichita lawyer. But it seems unlikely the famous jurist would have advised him to trust Moore.
“In the very first séance, Mrs. Moore, in a semi-trance, told the Kansan his son had come to her and was telling her what to say,” reported the San Francisco Examiner in July 1927. He was cautioned that turning on the lights, or otherwise interfering with the spirits, would result in immediate death.
Like many of us, Seybold was susceptible to flattery. He was called “doctor” by those in his medium’s orbit, apparently after healing somebody of a headache, and was told he could quickly become proficient at piano if only he bought one for Moore’s home.
“Here’s a lonely old man,” Shepard said. “He believed he was really in love with a ghost. At trial, he pondered whether he was really married to her or did he need to get a divorce?”
The only time “Sarah” visited him in his bedroom, according to Shepard, Seybold became suspicious. “All he saw of her was her hands,” he said. “But instead of just fading away, she backed out of his room and around the corner. Ghosts don’t do that, do they?”
The case went to trial in November 1927.
Moore claimed that Seybold came to establish a “spiritualistic class room,” but that he soon began claiming healing powers of his own. She admitted she had been the recipient of gifts and loans secured by mortgages, but denied having hoodwinked Seybold. Witnesses testified, however, that Moore had shown them devices used in her séances, including a speaking trumpet with a rubber hose and a star that glowed with luminous paint.
“An Aged Farmer Loses his Battle with the Spooks,” the Wichita Eagle reported Nov. 17. “Superlative advice might come from the trusted sources of the spirit world, but all of Seybold’s business transactions were drawn in black and white.”
The judge, J.E. Alexander, ruled Seybold had no case because he had reached a compromise settlement with Moore before bringing his suit. Any question of spectral evidence was not considered. Even if fraud had been involved in summoning “Sarah,” it was not for the court to decide whether spirit communication was possible or had been practiced by Moore.
While Seybold’s faith in Moore was shattered, he remained an ardent spiritualist. He later married again, this time to a woman named Dollie who was an ordained spiritualist minister.
“He was looking for something,” Shepard said. “I think we all desire to connect with something beyond ourselves.”
In the years he’s been investigating the paranormal, Shepard said, he’s run into only three people he considered true mediums. One of them is a woman in Topeka, and when she does her readings for groups of 30 or 50 people, she doesn’t turn the lights off.
“Real paranormal research isn’t done in the dark,” he said. “They want the lights on. They want to see what’s happening around them. They’re trying to answer the questions we’re still searching for. Where do we go when we die? Is there life after death?”
Shepard said he was both a believer and a skeptic. He says he believes there are spirits out there, but that he doesn’t necessarily believe every story that’s told to him.
But there is still mystery to the “ghost bride” case, he said.
What was Seybold’s son’s name, and how did he die? What was Sarah’s last name? Seybold said he knew her during his youth in Dayton, but there’s no evidence from him of how she crossed over — or whether she existed at all.
We may never know.
Seybold died in 1941, aged 85, of lingering injuries suffered when he was struck by a car a year earlier at Third and Broadway in Wichita. Moore moved to California, where she died in 1974, at San Diego. She was 83.
A century after Seybold attended that first séance in Wichita, it might be easy for us to dismiss him as a fool. Here in the modern and allegedly rational age, we would never fall for such tricks. Right?
But there are people who fall in love with their AI chatbots. This year, a Colorado man “married” his digital companion, with the approval of his real-world wife. And the MIT Technology Review cautions that it’s easy to stumble into an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.
We’re all looking for something, whether it’s “Sarah” or “Siri.”
Perhaps in a hundred years, some cyber columnist will look back and be incredulous that any chatbot could ever fall for an ephemeral something made of meat and bone.

But I hate the leaves!
Sure, they look pretty as they change colors, but when those leaves are spent and fall to the ground, they present real problems for travelers.
Whether you rake your leaves yourself or have someone “blow” them for you, disposing of leaves is a hassle.
Growing up (many years ago) I remember we used to burn our leaves, heedless to the air pollution and health effects. A better alternative is to use a mulching-mower and just grind up the leaves on your lawn, providing much-needed nutrients to your soil. Or try composting them on your own property.


In most towns leaves must be bagged and left curbside for pick-up. In other towns, like Stamford, Middletown and Farmington, you can just rake the leaves into a pile at the curb, loose, and the town will vacuum them up… eventually. Often however, the piles of leaves left curbside get rained on, creating a giant soggy mess, blocking parking and leading to slippery roads. At speeds of 40–45mph, it can take up to three times longer to stop on wet leaves compared to dry pavement, with stopping distance increasing from about 80 feet to over 200–250feet.
But the slippery, almost winter-like driving conditions caused by wet leaves also affect our trains. Their wheels also slip on wet leaves and the trains’ “brains” sense it and go into emergency braking. You’ll know this is happening when the trains suddenly “dump their air”, and brake quickly.
Usually it’s just a minute or so to reset the computer and you carry on. But as in a real emergency, braking and stopping distance are quickly diminished. Which is why railroads take a number of defensive steps to literally clear the tracks.
So bad was the leaf slime problem in years past that Metro-North would have 25% of its fleet out of service as the trains’ brakes locked the wheels to a stop, grinding flat spots on the wheels, requiring repairs.
This is especially a problem on the Danbury branch, a 397-foot uphill climb from Norwalk to “The Hat City”.  Often, locomotive-pulled trains couldn’t get enough traction so that they had to skip stations like Cannondale just to keep momentum to climb uphill.
You see, on a diesel locomotive there are only eight traction wheels making contact with the rails.  But on the electric M8 cars, every car is a locomotive, so contact with the wheels is spread across the entire train, increasing traction…another good reason to re-electrify the Danbury branch.

In years past the railroad used high-pressure water jets to blast the slippery leaf pectin from the rails. But now they have resorted to lasers.
Metro-North’s Laser Train uses high-intensity lasers to remove this contaminated layer in a single pass at speeds up to 60 mph, allowing Metro-North to clean the entire network at least once a day. The train is a rare sight, usually operating overnight to clear the tracks in time for the morning rush hour.
Last year the Laser Train saw a 40% reduction in leaf-related “slip slide” events, leading to the lowest wheel-regrinding costs on record.  
So enjoy the fall and the beauty of the foliage. But beware the dangers, whether driving or training, of “slip sliding away”.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201020_CatHollowPark_KIM_09.jpg,,,2025-10-26 04:16:31.946391

The landscape of housing services […]","AS A FAMILY medicine physician at Boston Medical Center, I have cared for hundreds of individuals and families experiencing homelessness over the last 20 years. The landscape of housing services that I can offer them continues to change, sometimes leaving me with a great sense of hope and possibility and, at other times, more hopeless than ever for my patients’ restoration to health.  
Recently, this seesaw from hope to hopelessness has become more extreme, as decisions by our state leaders seem to be simultaneously pulling in opposite directions when it comes to housing help for those most in need. Two families for whom I provide medical care illustrate the mixed messages of our state’s recent housing policies affecting the state’s most vulnerable residents. 
The first is a husband-and-wife couple in their seventies. I have cared for them both for over 10 years, and while they have both suffered a litany of medical concerns, the husband has been particularly unwell. He came to me with a history of long, uncontrolled high blood pressure and diabetes with an ensuing heart attack and stroke. He also was suffering from an untreated substance use disorder, which helped him paper over his years of untreated anxiety and depression.  
One saving grace when I met him was that he had a safe and stable place to live. From that fundamental base, we could begin to build back his health — delivering medications to his doorstep, connecting him to community services, and treating both his behavioral health concerns and substance use.  
Seven years ago, however, this fundamental base disappeared when he lost his housing. Three years into retirement, he no longer had enough savings for a home. Ironically, he was a retired construction foreman from Boston, where throughout his 30-year career, he had poured his talent into building homes in Roxbury and Dorchester.  
Despite years of working with incredible housing advocates, my patient and his wife have not been able to find a stable place to live and continue to sleep on loved ones’ couches in a distant Boston suburb. As a result, his health has begun to rapidly deteriorate again. It is harder to come in for appointments, to receive his medications when he does not know where he will next be sleeping, and to keep his diabetes medications in the fridge or his diet filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. 
However, in the last few months, things have begun to look at least a little more hopeful for this gentleman and patients like him. Early this year, Gov. Healey released “A Home for Everyone,” the state’s first comprehensive plan to address Massachusetts’s housing challenge. The plan aims to build 200,000 new housing units by 2030. This ambitious goal came a year after the governor signed the Affordable Homes Act, which authorized more than $5 billion in spending and included nearly 50 policy initiatives to spur more housing. In addition, three new commissions have been established to prioritize the residents of these future homes: elderly, extremely low income (earning less than 30 percent of the median income), and individuals with disabilities (physical, sensory, intellectual, mental health or neurodivergent).  
My patient and his wife fit squarely into all three of these categories. Though the housing needs among these groups far outstrip the available supply, since the launch of these state initiatives, I have begun writing letters advocating that, given his medical conditions, he cannot be living with unstable housing — this time with greater hope that these letters will make an impact.  
For another family in my care struggling to find stable housing, the situation has not turned hopeful, but is, in fact, more grim as a result of recent actions by state government.  
They first came to me for a prenatal visit. New to Massachusetts, nobody in the family had a primary care provider and, seeing their complex social needs, I agreed to have all family members (the mother, father, older sibling, and soon to be infant) establish care with me that day.   
When they moved to Massachusetts, this family was able to benefit from our strong 40-year precedent of the “right to shelter” law, signed by Gov. Dukakis in 1983, that mandated shelter services for parents with children and pregnant women.  
Partnering with incredible organizations such FamilyAid, homeless families have been able to find shelter and transition to housing. Through the safety of stable shelter, the mother in this family was able to expend her energy finding and receiving adequate prenatal care — yielding the best possible outcomes for both the newborn and her future health.  
The parents were also able to start securing employment resources as well as educational support and starting to get back on their financial feet. Like many families living in Boston, this one was living on meager wages (though did not qualify as extremely low income).  
Boston, surprisingly perhaps for some, carries the unenviable statistic of having the fifth largest number of families living in poverty among 30 of the largest US cities, with poverty levels 65 percent higher than the national average. This translates to the third highest rate and the fifth highest number of homeless families among comparable large cities. However, the “right to shelter” has now been dismantled through a recent set of mandates from the Healey  administration, limiting the number of shelters available (from a high of 7,500 family shelter units in 2023 to 4,000 units by 2026) as well as imposing a six-month maximum stay in shelters.  
These new rules place this family, and thousands of families like them, at dire risk. In addition to the devastating health outcomes for adults experiencing homelessness, children who are homeless are also at high risk for a myriad of downstream health outcomes. These include such concerns as higher adverse childhood events, higher risk of future behavioral health illness such as depression and suicide attempts, higher rates of future substance use, lower levels of educational attainment, and higher risk of homelessness as an adult.  
The current fiscal constraints of the state and the high cost of shelter services are legitimate concerns. But turning our backs on families in need is not just wrong; it’s shortsighted and works against the long-range goals the governor has set. Children experiencing homelessness are at high risk of becoming the next generation of homeless individuals that Gov. Healey and her team are trying to help in her laudable “Home for Everyone” plan.  
As I bear witness to the housing journeys of these two families and countless others like them, I cannot help but wonder if Massachusetts leaders have lost sight of the whole picture. If we are truly to address the housing crisis in our state, we cannot only work to find housing for our elderly and disabled while simultaneously giving up on our children and families.  
Our health as a Commonwealth depends upon the current and future health of each of us.

Dan Glickman of Wichita proposes Kansas Democrats deepen ties to rural Kansas with economic messages and a dose of self-deprecating humor.,"Former U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman urges Kansas Democrats to expand the party's base into rural communities with messages tied to meat-and-potatoes economic issues that delve into leadership shortcomings of President Donald Trump. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)WICHITA — Fifty years ago, Wichita school board member Dan Glickman turned to his wife and declared interest in running for the U.S. House.
“She said, ‘You don’t have a chance. You don’t have a shot,’ ” he said, recounting a campaign that would precede his 18 years of service in Congress representing the Wichita region.
The Kansas Democrat defeated eight-term incumbent Garner Shriver, a low-key Republican with the misfortune of running for reelection in the post-Watergate era. Glickman’s rookie run for Congress didn’t feature a mountain of cash — he raised a mere $100,000. He attributed success, in part, to relentless shoe-leather campaigning and knocking on 45,000 homes in the district.
“I don’t know if that could happen today, because you need a message, you need money, you need time and you need luck,” he said at an event Saturday sponsored by the Sedgwick County Democratic Party and Wichita State University Young Democrats.
Fast forward 50 years, Glickman said, and the imperative was for Democrats to win control of the U.S. House in 2026. Three of Kansas four congressional seats are held by Republicans, but the Kansas Legislature could redraw maps to make it difficult for Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids to win reelection next year.
Glickman said Democratic control of the House would bring more balance to the federal government because the GOP currently had simultaneous hold of the House and Senate in the second term of President Donald Trump.
“We’ve got to elect a Democratic Congress,” Glickman said. “I’m not going to tell you it’s going to be easy. One of the reasons why is because, perhaps, our messaging isn’t right.”
 
Appeal to rural voters
Glickman said Democrats shouldn’t be a party of culture warriors. The agenda should reflect meat-and-potatoes economic issues that included health care, education and employment, he said. The objective in Kansas, he said, must be to expand Democrats’ base from population centers such as Johnson County and nominate candidates more relevant to interests of rural Kansans.
“We cannot win without appealing to rural, small-town America,” said Glickman, who served as secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton. “There’s a lot of raw material there. I don’t know if they’re going to go through with this, but the president is proposing to give … $25 billion to the government of Argentina so they can sell more beef into the United States.”
Trump’s proposal has been condemned by U.S. livestock producers who earned solid returns on beef sales at the same time domestic grain farmers suffered a period of low market prices and high input costs.
The president’s plan to lower grocery prices with imports could be an opportunity for Democratic candidates to speak with rural voters about a topic central to survival of their communities, Glickman said.
“Focus on issues that people care about — economic issues, inflation, cost of health care, research and America’s role in the world,” he said.
 
Negotiation and humor
Glickman, who held his seat in the U.S. House from 1977 to 1995, when ousted by GOP nominee Todd Tiahrt, said debate about fixing what ailed Washington, D.C., shouldn’t be an exclusively partisan conversation. He said there were “loads of good Republicans who don’t like what’s happening either.”
He said the government shutdown should be resolved through negotiation. But the messages Americans see each night on television have been dominated by partisan attacks. Trump should be a key player in working out a deal, he said.
“That’s what the American political system is all about,” Glickman said. “It’s really difficult with a president who doesn’t want to get his hands dirty when getting in there to solve the problem.”
Glickman, who also worked as chief executive officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, said Democrats could better connect with voters by deploying a sense of humor. The idea isn’t to be stand-up comedians, he said, but to offer voters a slice of self-deprecating humor that illustrates personal life lessons.
He pointed to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt as role models in this regard, and criticized the current array of national politicians as humorless.
“I have found that almost every successful person — every leader that is successful in politics or whatever field — has a decent sense of humor,” Glickman said. “They could laugh at themselves. I have never seen (Trump) laugh at himself. Only at other people.”
He said recent No Kings rallies across the United States successfully brought unity among people frustrated by Trump. His praise elicited a round of applause from more than 100 people at the luncheon on the Wichita State University campus.
“Are you going to follow up? If you don’t, they’re a total waste of time,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dan-Glickman-1-wichita-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-25 17:56:47.694699

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The Louisiana Senate voted along political party lines Saturday to push back 2026 election dates in an effort to leave as much time as possible to redraw Louisiana’s congressional map. Republicans expect to craft political districts more to their liking if they receive a favorable ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court later this year. 
The GOP Senate majority, made up entirely of white senators, outvoted the Democrats, all but one of whom are Black, 27-9, on Senate Bill 1. The legislation moves the political candidate qualifying period and two spring election dates for congressional primary contests back by approximately one month. 
Elections scheduled for April 18 and May 30 would move to May 16 and June 27 respectively.
The delayed election timeline will create more opportunity for the Republican-controlled legislature to draw new U.S. House districts where Black voters, who overwhelmingly vote for Democrats, have less influence over who gets elected.  
Louisiana’s current congressional map, passed in early 2024, is made up of six House seats, including two districts with a majority Black electorate. Those two seats are held by Black Democrats, Troy Carter of New Orleans and Cleo Fields of Baton Rouge. 
Should the Supreme Court allow it, state lawmakers will likely approve a new congressional map that includes one or zero majority-Black districts, even though the state’s population is approximately one-third Black. This would make it harder for Black officials and Democrats to be elected to Congress.

Republicans are hopeful the Supreme Court will hand down a ruling in the Callais v. Louisiana case that not only allows them to draw new maps but on an expedited schedule. 

While Supreme Court decisions typically come out in late spring or early summer, Louisiana Republican officials want justices to issue a ruling in this case by the end of December. 

The accelerated timeline would allow state lawmakers to draw new U.S. House seats in time for the next congressional election in November. If the decision comes out later, lawmakers would likely have to wait another two years — the length of a term in the U.S. House — to use new political districts.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The Supreme Court will not necessarily rule by the end of the year, however. Even if it does, Louisiana would probably not be obligated to change its political map in time for the November election contests. 
Previously, when the Supreme Court has struck down election maps as unconstitutional, it has not required that new maps be drawn and used if the election process is already underway or about to start. The court has permitted – even required – states to wait to use their newly compliant maps in the next cycle, which would be 2028 for Louisiana’s U.S. House seats.
But President Donald Trump has urged Republican officials in states across the country to redraw their congressional districts to favor the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. More Republican districts would increase the chances the U.S. House would remain under Republican control and aligned with Trump. 
In Louisiana, GOP lawmakers have tried to downplay arguments from Democrats that their efforts to push back the election dates are related to Trump’s push to have more Republican seats. 

Republicans have said the moving of the election dates is simply allowing more time to get clarity from the Supreme Court over redistricting requirements. 

“We could draw a 6-0 map. We could draw a 5-0 map [that removes majority-Black districts]. That’s not what we’re here doing,” said Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, a white Republican from Port Allen and sponsor of the legislation, ahead of the Senate floor vote Saturday. 
Democrats countered that the election dates were being moved for no other reason than to accommodate the Republicans’ desires to pass a map with fewer majority-Black districts faster. 
“Remember when President Trump so boldly stated to the state legislatures to go and get me more Republican congressional districts?” Sen. Katrina Jackson, a Black Democrat from Monroe, said Saturday. “We’re not here for drawing districts, but it seems like we’re here in the hopes that the Supreme Court will rule a certain way.”
Moving election dates will affect more than just next year’s congressional races. 

Municipal elections and ballot initiatives that were supposed to be voted on at the same time as the congressional primaries will also be pushed back in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling. 

Depending on what the Supreme Court decides, it’s possible that some municipalities could also redraw their political districts ahead of elections to provide Black voters with less influence at the local level too, Sen. Gerald Boudreaux of Lafayette, who is the head of the Senate Democratic Caucus, said in an interview this week. 
Lawmakers also had to write an exception into Senate Bill 1 that allows for local ballot measures concerning bonds, debt and taxes to move forward on the newly proposed election dates in May and June if those measures were initially pegged to current election dates that could be eliminated. 
On Saturday, the Senate also voted to push back the election dates of five proposed constitutional amendments from April 18 to May 16  through Senate Bill 2. These amendments include those that affect public school teacher compensation, the mandatory retirement age for state judges and a reworking of state civil service. 
Democrats argued that these adjustments are evidence the legislature is acting too swiftly to adjust elections. 
“I wish that this debate was as simple as what some people are trying to fashion – saying this is about moving dates,” Sen. Sam Jenkins, a Black Democrat from Shreveport, told his colleagues. “It’s really not that simple.”
Republicans said the changes they are to making are not consequential.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/electionday2022-009-1-1024x6831742327334-1.jpg,,,2025-10-25 16:01:34.157887

The Smyrna Eagles (4-4, 3-0 3A District 2) scored on all but one of their offensive drives defeating the St. Georges Hawks (5-3, 2-1 3A District 2), 44-12, Friday night. 
 
Smyrna defeated St. Georges, 44-12, Friday night earning its third win in a row — all against district opponents.  
The Eagles offense performed well in the passing game and the running game amassing over 200 yards on the ground and through the air. It was the passing game that got their offense going in the first quarter.
Junior quarterback Drew Marks and senior receiver Phoenix Henriquez connected four times on Smyrna’s opening drive as the offense traversed 64 yards down the field. Henriquez’s final catch of the drive was a nine yard touchdown that scored the game’s first points. 
The Eagles scored on their subsequent possession on a diving effort from senior Kahmaj Kearney at the goal line. Henriquez completed Smyrna’s first half scoring with a rushing touchdown right before halftime.
The Hawks scored once in the first half cutting the Eagles lead down to ten with less than six minutes remaining until halftime. 
Quarterback Jayden Goffigan and receiver Jordan Triplett connected on a 33-yard throw down the right side of the field that brought the offense to the Smyrna 16 yard line. Junior running back Joel Buck finished the drive with a two yard touchdown run off a direct snap, cutting into Smyrna’s lead. 
The Hawks scored again on their first possession after halftime driving 68 yards down the field. Junior running back Derek Foxmoor scored the touchdown with a two yard run up the middle from the shotgun formation. 
Smyrna scored the final three touchdowns of the second half all of which came on the ground. Henriquez, Marks and freshman Terrell Ingram all ran for a touchdown in the second half helping Smyrna to its second highest point total this season. 
The Eagles have two more games remaining in the regular season with a home matchup against Dover scheduled for November 1 and a road matchup against Sussex Central on November 7.
The Hawks will face Sussex Central before the Eagles with their matchup scheduled for November 1. After that game, St. Georges will finish the regular season on the road against Cape Henlopen on November 7.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gemini_Generated_Image_ufimraufimraufim.png,,,2025-10-25 13:16:44.335286

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Social Services plans to revamp its opioid treatment and prevention grants, with a three-tiered system including “transformative” grants up to $2 million.
Department officials announced the new grant structure using opioid settlement funds at Tuesday’s Board of Social Services meeting.
“Just trying to put some of the same window dressing on some of the same old methodologies isn’t what we’re after,” Secretary Matt Althoff said. “We’re looking for true innovation, a true effort to earnestly fill the gaps that exist today.”
South Dakota is projected to receive just under $99 million in settlement funds by 2038, based on the department’s settlement dashboard. The money comes from a series of nationwide settlements with the makers and sellers of the opioid painkillers that contributed to a spike in drug addiction and overdoses.
The majority of that funding will be distributed and spent by the state, while 30% will be used by local governments.
The state has received about $23 million in its share of the funds so far, with about $11.7 million uncommitted. The department plans to reserve about $12 million in a trust fund to sustain the state’s opioid abatement plan, in case federal funding for other substance use-related grants ends. That equates to about 25% of each disbursement received over the life of the settlement.

Most spent funds have gone toward the community grant program, with the state using part of its share to give additional money to local entities and organizations, followed by the prescription drug monitoring program, naloxone distribution (naloxone is a medication used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose) and overdose follow-up programs.
Brenna Koedam, behavior health division chief, said there is an increased number of referrals for opioid use and other substance use disorder treatment services, increased understanding in how to handle substance use among providers, reduced burnout among first responders and law enforcement, and reduced stigma surrounding opioid use disorder in the last few years. She did not explain to the board how most of those achievements were calculated or measured, though she attributed them to programming assisted by the settlement fund.
Opioid related deaths in South Dakota decreased to 39 in 2024, compared to 2023’s peak of 47. According to the state’s Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology data, 844 South Dakotans visited emergency departments for suspected drug overdoses — opioid and other — in the first six months of this year. That’s down by one visit compared to the same timeframe in 2024 and up by 44 compared to 2023. 
Attorney General Marty Jackley criticized the department in August for not spending the opioid settlement funds as quickly as he wanted, and not sending enough of the money to the city governments of Sioux Falls and Rapid City. Althoff said at the Tuesday meeting, and in response to Jackley’s comments in August, that the department needed to spend COVID-19 relief funds that were expiring before they spent more settlement dollars.

Koedam announced Tuesday that the department will restructure its community grants into three tiers:

Small grants of up to $5,000 for immediate or short-term projects, offered on an ongoing basis and focused on prevention, such as funding a speaker on opioid use and risks at a school district.
Mid-size grants of up to $50,000, offered twice a year, intended for projects that can be completed in a year.
“Transformative” grants of up to $2 million intended for regional innovation, which could include workforce development to attract more workers to the behavioral health field, based on a letter of interest from potential grant recipients.

Althoff said South Dakota’s substance use problems extend beyond opioids, citing meth and alcohol as other examples.
“The opioid dollars will not necessarily be able to just solve the opioid problem,” Althoff said. “We’re trying to be very creative about how we do this in ways that — even if opioid isn’t the first level of addiction, it might be even tertiary involvement — it’s all bridged and interrelated.”
Koedam added that the department signed contracts with Colorado-based Steadman Group and the University of South Dakota totaling just under $325,000 to conduct a statewide opioid needs assessment, which will identify gaps in South Dakota’s treatment and prevention infrastructure. The needs assessment is expected to be completed by spring 2026.

A visit to The Grove and LSU’s Cajun feasts,"Maura Carey and Brett Martel, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/25/tailgating-traditions-college-football-the-grove-lsu-cajun-feasts/,"Tailgating is a beloved tradition in the South, rivaling college football itself. Fans at Ole Miss gather at The Grove for elaborate setups and the Walk of Champions. At LSU, tailgates feature Cajun cuisine.","In the South, there is only one thing that can rival college football itself: the party before kickoff.
Pinpointing the exact origins of tailgating is near impossible. Some trace it to Nov. 6, 1869, when Rutgers and New Jersey (later Princeton) played in the first college football game. Others credit Green Bay Packers fans, who folded down pickup truck tailgates for makeshift pregame seating during the team’s inaugural season in 1919.
Arguments over who has the best tailgating traditions are as old as the sport itself and the creativity is as varied as the fans themselves. From Bevo Boulevard (Texas) and the Tiger Walk (Clemson) to the Vol Navy (Tennessee) and the sailgating on boats outside Husky Stadium (Washington), the options are endless.
The tradition runs deep in the South, and few do it like Ole Miss and LSU.
It’s hours before kickoff. Ole Miss is hosting LSU in its biggest game of the season so far, and tens of thousands of fans gather at The Grove, a 10-acre plot in the center of campus surrounded by oak trees. The grassy area has transformed into a sea of red and blue tents decked out with chandeliers and elaborate spreads.

Anticipation builds for The Walk of Champions – one of the program’s longest-standing traditions where coaches and players are met with applause and “Hotty Toddy” cheers as they exit the buses and pass under the archway en route to the stadium.
Elizabeth Heiskell, a caterer from Oxford, is at the center of it all. She’s become a Grove regular since marrying into the fan base, and she wouldn’t want it any other way.
“It is a beautiful space right in the middle of campus with gorgeous trees that have been here forever,” Heiskell said. “There’s just really no place like it. It’s not like we’re, you know, dropping a tailgate in some parking lot. I mean, it is so green and so beautiful.”
Like most Grove goers, Heiskell is dressed for the occasion. She’s wearing a red and white blouse, gold jewelry and a fabulous pair of red sunglasses that tie the whole look together. This isn’t an outfit she just threw together; gameday getups are carefully curated.
“Of course everybody gets dressed up. I mean, we shop all year long for our game clothes,” she said. “When they say it’s a red game, honey, we’re all gonna wear red.”
The pregame buzz carries into Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, where nearly 68,000 fans watch Ole Miss hold off LSU for a 24-19 victory.
Two weeks later, crawfish boils and Cajun spices replace the chandeliers and elegance of The Grove as the party moves 330 miles South to Baton Rouge.
Fresh off a bye week, LSU is hosting South Carolina in Death Valley, where home-field advantage is alive and well, thanks to a passionate fan base of their own.

Gameday preparation begins early for Wayne Breaux, a fisherman from New Iberia, Louisiana. He drives up to his condo near campus on Thursday night, reserves his spot on Friday and begins the setup early Saturday. After 35 years, his tailgate has become quite the attraction. Breaux regularly welcomes football, basketball and softball coaches and recruits.
“Tailgating is an event in itself. A lot of people, even if they don’t have tickets to the game, they’ll come out and enjoy the atmosphere, the friendship and the camaraderie,” Breaux said. “I love the football game itself, but tailgating is a very close second.”
Like every good tailgate, Breaux’s setup centers around the menu. His spread features speckled trout, red fish, steak tips, pork loin, and of course, jambalaya and boudin.
“We got one rule,” Breaux said. “If you leave here thirsty or hungry, it’s your fault. It’s not mine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21135351/AP25290045208644.jpg,,,2025-10-25 08:16:40.899223

“Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” protestors chanted in the middle of Times Square, among a sea of signs that read “love reigns not kings,” “gays against faux-king Trump,” “we stand with … our trans family,” and “the future is coming.”
On Saturday, Oct. 18, independent analysts estimated that the No Kings March drew between
5 and 8 million people, and organizers say over 7 million people attended 2,700 events across all 50 states. The event, which was organized to push against the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S., was the largest single-day protest in America since 1970.

Among the crowd were countless LGBTQ people, fighting back against an administration that has introduced a litany of anti-LGBTQ executive orders and used vile rhetoric to denigrate queer people.
This backsliding of LGBTQ rights, according to experts, has a deep connection to authoritarianism, with research showing that when governments weaken protections for queer and trans people, they often turn to broader democratic institutions next.
“Threats to democratic institutions and threats to LGBTQ rights are mutually reinforcing, generating a vicious cycle that strengthens authoritarian control,” said Ari Shaw, director of International Programs at the Williams Institute. “Increased persecution of minority groups, including LGBTI people, is itself evidence of democratic backsliding by indicating the erosion of liberal democratic norms meant to protect minority rights.”
 Legal Abuse of Power

One of the ways the Trump administration’s abuse of power has been most evident is through its legal actions.
On Jan. 20, Trump signed 26 executive orders, the most signed by any president on their first day. Since then, he’s penned hundreds more—more than President Joe Biden signed during his entire four-year term. In many cases, he bypassed Congress in the process, leaving elected legislators on the sidelines.
Many of these actions have targeted LGBTQ rights. Trump has used executive orders to ban transgender people from serving in the military, limit participation of transgender students in school sports, and direct federal agencies to recognize only two sexes.
He’s also slashed HIV funding at a staggering rate. Uncloseted Media estimates that the National Institutes of Health has terminated more than $1 billion worth of grants to HIV-related research, including 71% of all global HIV grants.
“The specific reason that I’m protesting is actually on the shirt I’m wearing,” said Brooklynite Jeffrey Cipriano. “My best friend works for an organization called AIDS United. … His job is to travel the country and help people get AIDS medication, specifically trans and unhoused community members. But his job is at risk.”
Executive orders are meant to direct how existing laws are implemented—but Trump has ignored democratic norms, filling agencies with loyalists, using orders to go after opponents, and pushing the limits of what the law allows.
“The President is directing various executive branch officials to adopt policy that has either not yet been adopted by Congress or is in violation of existing statutory law,” said Jodi Short, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “The analogy to a king … is the sheer consolidation of executive branch power in one individual.”
“Illegality has been rampant,” added Dave Owen, Short’s colleague. “People are often cynical about government … but most of the time, the executive branch takes the law seriously. This administration has broken with those traditions.”
 Revolt Against Executive Orders

Many Americans have recognized this. A survey from April found that 85% of Americans agreed that the president should obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t like them.
In response to Trump’s overreach, more than 460 legal challenges have been filed across the country challenging his executive actions. One is a federal lawsuit by Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation that challenges the constitutionality of the transgender military ban. Another lawsuit challenges Trump’s order withholding funds from medical providers offering gender-affirming care to minors.

Both lawsuits are why 17-year-old Zoe Boik joined the protest with her dad. “Obviously, I’m disappointed and kind of helpless because there’s nothing I can directly do to change or impact anything that’s going on,” said Boik, who identifies as pansexual and gender fluid.
 LGBTQ Rights and Democratic Backsliding

This type of blatant discrimination is often a key sign of a country moving closer to authoritarianism. A 2023 research paper by Shaw and colleagues found that anti-LGBTQ stigma may contribute “to the erosion of democratic norms and institutions.”
“The level of acceptance of LGBTQ people is closely associated with the strength of democracy in a country,” said Shaw. “In some cases, rising anti-LGBTQ rhetoric or policies preceded a broader decline in democracy.”
Examples include Brazil under Bolsonaro and Poland under the Law and Justice Party, both of which saw LGBTQ rights regress alongside democratic erosion.
When it comes to LGBTQ rights, Trump has mirrored these leaders—even though most Americans don’t support it. A 2022 survey found that 80% of Americans favor laws protecting LGBTQ people against discrimination.
“The definition of an authoritarian system is a system where power is consolidated in one individual whose power is unchecked by any other institution,” said Short. “And I fear that’s the direction this administration is trying to move us.”
 Attacks on Higher Education

Another common tool in the authoritarian playbook is attacking higher education.
Trump has pressured top universities to eliminate DEI programs and inclusive policies for transgender athletes, calling them “ideological capture.”

“I’m here because I’m angry and I feel that we aren’t angry enough,” said Maddy Everlith, a gender studies major at Pace University. “Being a woman of color in America and having so many intersectional identities … I want to stand up and advocate for other people.”
 Scapegoating Transgender People

Beyond laws and policies lies a vile rhetoric used to scapegoat trans Americans. During the 2024 campaign, Trump spent roughly $215 million on anti-trans ads—more than five times what he spent on the economy.
“What Trump has done is he’s taken people that haven’t done anything wrong and has turned them into scapegoats,” said Lars Kindem, a retired pilot. “His language is hateful, petty, mean and hurtful.”
 Christian Nationalism

This scapegoating has fueled Trump’s alliance with white evangelical Protestants—the only major denomination in which most believe society has gone too far in accepting transgender people.
“For Christian nationalists, attacking LGBTQ rights is the first pillar in destroying civil rights for all,” said Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “This has happened in countries like Hungary and Poland, and now it’s happening here.”
 Moving Forward

As the country bleeds toward authoritarianism, LGBTQ protestors are encouraging people to use their voice—something the queer community knows well. A 2012 survey found that queer folks are 20 times more likely to be active in liberal social movements than their straight, cis counterparts.
“It is imperative that people continue to pay attention,” said Short. “We have to engage in political action and resist inappropriate assertions of authority and continue to show up and vote for our democracy.”
Seventeen-year-old Zoe Boik is ready. She remembers crying the day after Trump won in 2016. Now, she’s eager to vote in the next election.
“My fears about Trump don’t stem specifically from me being queer, but from his authoritarianism as a whole,” she said. “I am scared about how far he will move into dictatorship, and my biggest fear is that our right to vote will be compromised.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-1024x737.png,,,2025-10-25 07:16:56.258027

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said the decision left him feeling “extremely disappointed.” Crowley spoke from his office at the Milwaukee County Courthouse Friday, saying that the funds would go towards repairing parks, government buildings, and other public infrastructure damaged by the so-called flooding which swept communities two months ago. 
When the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially sent disaster relief after the floods, Crowley said he “commended the Trump administration,” and that “I thought that we were putting politics behind us in making sure that communities can recover.” Crowley said that by Friday over $123 million in financial assistance has been distributed to county residents for home repairs.

But it’s not just local businesses and homes that were damaged. The rainfall, which fell in a torrential downpour on the weekend of Aug. 9, left Hart Park in Wauwatosa underwater. Downed trees and other debris were strewn along roadways. Cars, swept away by the overnight flooding, were abandoned in the street for days. 
Over 1,800 homes were left damaged or destroyed, with an estimated $34 million in damage to public infrastructure. “The preliminary damage assessments show that the damage that we saw throughout all six counties is more than significant,” said Crowley. “Roads and bridges that our residents rely on sustained substantial damage. Public buildings and facilities were not only washed away, but in some cases had significant mold contamination that will also impact the public health and safety of our residents. Our parks and our trails, they were damaged, which will harm our quality of life in the short term, as well as the long term, and the list goes on.”
Crowley pointed to Hart Park as a prime example of an area with lingering damage additional funds could remedy. As the disaster relief is denied, Milwaukee County is also in the middle of crafting a budget which will not be padded by COVID-era federal funds. County supervisors are currently debating amendments to Crowley’s proposed $1.4 billion budget, which carries cuts to transit services and eviction legal defense programs and increases property taxes by 4.1%.
“We’re already making challenging decisions about funding not only programs and services, but future infrastructure spending, and capital projects that are needed not only now, but in the years ahead. Today’s action by the Trump administration will send us back even further. It will delay progress in our recovery efforts from this natural disaster, and it will place a financial burden solely on local taxpayers who have already had to sacrifice so much as a result of these floods.”

Tony Evers issued a statement Friday saying he filed an appeal asking the Trump administration to release more than $26.5 million in public assistance for infrastructure repair  it has denied. “Denying federal assistance doesn’t just delay recovery, it sends a message to our communities that they are on their own, and that the Trump administration doesn’t think over $26 million in damages to public infrastructure is worthy of their help,” Evers said in a press statement. “I couldn’t disagree more. The federal government should not expect our communities to go through this alone, and we are going to fight tooth and nail to ensure they get every possible resource to rebuild and recover. We are hopeful that the Trump administration will reconsider this decision, so we can make sure folks have the resources and support they need.”
The denial comes during a federal government shutdown that has lasted nearly a month. In a letter to Evers, FEMA said that while the flood damage was significant, assessments determined that “the public assistance program is not warranted.” 
The storm and flooding was dubbed a “thousand year storm” and dumped record-breaking amounts of rain essentially overnight. Wisconsin now has 30 days to send an appeal. 
“Turning your back on families facing washed-out roads, damaged schools, and flooded homes because they’re not seen as political allies is unconscionable,” said Kerry Schumann, executive director of Wisconsin Conservation Voters in a statement. “These communities didn’t cause this crisis, but they’re living through it. They deserve leadership that helps them recover and protects them from the next flood, not one that deepens the damage.”

“By denying federal assistance, the Trump Administration is leaving Wisconsin communities to fend for themselves,” said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. “No community can pick up these pieces alone, and Wisconsinites need support so they can rebuild and be on the road to recovery. I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on the Trump administration to step up to the plate and be here for Wisconsin communities left in the lurch.
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, Democrat of Milwaukee, also expressed  frustration. “Our state was forced to wait nearly two months for the Trump administration’s ill-advised and disappointing decision,” Moore said in a statement. “Communities in Milwaukee, which are still recovering, are counting on federal assistance to help fund critical repairs to public roadways, buildings, vehicles, and equipment that were severely damaged.” Nevertheless, Moore said, “Wisconsinites do not give up.” 
Rep. Kalan Haywood (D-Milwaukee) also issued a statement condemning the denial. Haywood said that the Trump administration “is sending a clear message to the people of Wisconsin – ‘we do not care about you’.” Haywood added that, “these funds are so badly needed to repair infrastructure, businesses, and schools. These are all essential to reverse the trend of President Trump’s faltering economy. Our residents pay millions in federal taxes and they should not face these hardships alone.” 
Haywood added  that Wisconsin’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) “is on the verge of drying up.” while  “communities are left to rebuild major infrastructure on their own, it is disappointing that the White House is choosing a $300 million ballroom ego-project over the well-being of the people of our state. It is my hope that FEMA reconsiders this decision to ensure that Wisconsin residents have a chance to recover and prosper. Wisconsinites deserve better and should demand better.”
Two bills related to disaster relief (AB-580 and AB-581) have been introduced to the Wisconsin Legislature as communities process the news. One bill would require the Department of Military Affairs to create a program to award grants to individuals and businesses severely impacted by disasters related to a state of emergency declared by the governor. Grants of no more than $25,000 could be awarded under the bill to an individual to help repair a residence, and grants of no more than $50,000 would go to businesses. The other bill would also work through the Department of Military Affairs, and would appropriate $10 million in  disaster assistance grants for individuals, and $20 million in grants for businesses in the 2025-26 fiscal year.

John Jagler (L) and Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R). Republicans scolded State Superintendent Jill Underly for not appearing at a hearing prompted by a Cap Times investigation of teacher sexual misconductU.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the leading Republican candidate for governor of Wisconsin, held a press conference on the steps of the state Capitol Thursday to declare his outrage over a Cap Times investigation that tracked more than 200 cases of alleged child sexual abuse by Wisconsin teachers and suggested a lack of accountability and transparency by the state Department of Public Instruction. 
Bolstering Tiffany’s case, State Superintendent Jill Underly decided to skip Thursday’s Senate hearing on the controversy. Instead, Underly traveled to Indiana to accept an award from her alma mater, leaving DPI staff to endure questioning by members of a state Senate committee eager to hang child sex abuse allegations around the necks of DPI, Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats.
Recognizing an opportunity, Tiffany parachuted in to add his voice to the chorus. “You will never have to wonder if I will show up,” Tiffany declared. “I will always be there for Wisconsin and our children, even when state Democrat leaders fail to do so.” He drew a tenuous connection between the accusation that DPI has provided insufficient oversight of predatory teachers to bashing the state agency for “lower standards” in schools and for embracing diversity, equity and inclusion. ”DPI spent two hours a week creating a DEI plan, but couldn’t find the time to investigate these cases,” Tiffany declared. He promised that if he’s elected governor he will ensure proper misconduct investigations of teachers and create a public dashboard showing why they lost their licenses, “most of all,” he added, “we’re going to educate kids, not indoctrinate.” 
As soon as Tiffany finished converting the story about abuse by teachers into red meat for his campaign, state Democrats jumped into the mosh pit, accusing him of hypocrisy because he voted against releasing the Epstein files. 
None of this mud-slinging sheds any light on what’s happening to kids in Wisconsin schools or how the state can better protect them.
Several of my daughters’ friends at Madison East High School were targeted by David Krutchen, a popular teacher who had close relationships with many of his students and who, it turned out, spent years spying on girls during overnight field trips, placing hidden cameras in hotel bathrooms and bedrooms. The Krutchen case took a heavy toll on those kids and their families. It was a shocking, disgusting betrayal of the students by a trusted adult. For years the court hearings dragged on, and traumatized students had to keep showing up to testify. Finally, Krutchen went to prison.
According to the Cap Times story, which includes interviews with some of Krutchen’s victims, DPI “shielded” more than 200 cases of teacher sexual misconduct from the public. That frame could lead you to believe that DPI was protecting pedophile teachers the same way the Catholic Church spent years shuffling pedophile priests around to avoid. But that’s not the impression I got from DPI’s testimony. In a video Underly posted on Facebook, and in her deputies’ testimony to legislators, the agency insisted that allowing teachers to voluntarily give up their licenses is not a “loophole” to end embarrassing investigations but ensures teachers who face misconduct charges are entered into a national database that can be accessed by other state education departments.
The Cap Times story, aided by a successful open records request, does give the sense that DPI has a slipshod system for keeping track of misconduct investigations, with just two staff people in charge of hundreds of cases, information stored on a Google spreadsheet, and 20% of cases where it’s unclear what type of misconduct was investigated. 
In its defense, DPI points out that the Legislature cut the agency’s budget by millions of dollars and they are doing their best. That point would have sounded better coming from Underly herself, instead of her deputies who had to fill in because she couldn’t bother to appear in person to demonstrate she actually cares about these horrible cases. 
Underly’s failure to show up and address the repercussions of the story is inexcusable. As the top educator in the state, she needs to reassure students and their parents that she cares about them and is on their side.
But the Republicans rushing to connect Underly’s weak leadership to all of their talking points about schools are equally unhelpful.
Ever since former Gov. Scott Walker began heaping scorn on teachers, painting them as lazy, overpaid and incompetent while ramming through his explosively controversial union-busting Act 10 law, the GOP has weaponized divisive distrust of teachers and public schools. Aided by a powerful private school choice lobby, they’ve hammered away on the idea that private schools are better and siphoned millions of dollars in taxpayer support for public education out of public classrooms and into the private sphere.
“We are going to make sure that Wisconsin goes back to the top of the game,” Tiffany declared Thursday, adding, “We are behind Mississippi in educational attainment. Less than one in three kids can read at grade level in the fourth grade in the state of Wisconsin. Is that not a disaster? That will not be the case if I’m elected as governor, we will have accountability and we will have higher standards.”
But the defunding of Wisconsin public schools that began under Walker and continues today is directly tied to the decline in quality. It’s not laziness or pedophilia that plague our school system. It’s deliberate neglect.
Republican calls for “higher standards” and “accountability” have, over the past two decades, been accompanied by disinvestment and the steady expansion of a publicly funded private voucher school system.
Ironically, the private schools Republicans champion in the school choice program have no teacher licensing requirements and DPI has no way to oversee or investigate their employees. Nor are private schools subject to Wisconsin’s open records laws. We will never get to see how they handle cases of employee misconduct.
There’s a reason it’s a big story when adults abuse the trust of children. It’s despicable behavior. Politicians who ignore or capitalize on that crime for political gain do us no good.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As the regulatory conservation associate for the Idaho Conservation League, I have reviewed hundreds of pollution control permits for industrial facilities across Idaho. These permits allow facilities like factories and mines to conduct operations while being protective of public health, clean water and clean air. In particular, I have closely followed and pushed back against the development of Perpetua Resource’s Stibnite Gold Project. 
At central Idaho’s Stibnite Gold Mine, crews start initial construction 

I was encouraged by my colleague Dr. Ian von Lindern’s informative and expert-based commentary regarding the troubling health effects this mega-mine presents. I was surprised to see former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Andrew Wheeler, join the debate and directly address Dr. von Lindern’s comments in a rebuttal commentary. 
While engaging in tit for tat op-ed commentary might normally be unproductive, I feel it’s important to address the hypocrisy of his conclusion that “Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth,” as his opinion is neither scientific, transparent nor truthful. 
Mr. Wheeler’s “science” comments echo Perpetua’s testimony before the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. I heard these same arguments as both Dr. von Lindern and I testified during the same administrative hearing process Mr. Wheeler references. While I am unsure how much Mr. Wheeler familiarized himself with the complex air quality “science” of the issue, I am sure Idaho families should not trust Mr. Wheeler’s opinion on this matter. 
Mr. Wheeler’s claims are startling coming from an EPA director who consistently undermined science and transparency. As the Union of Concerned Scientists outlined back in 2019, during his time as EPA director, Mr. Wheeler sidelined and ignored scientists, proposed restricting scientific data, recommended unsafe levels of drinking water contaminants, and rolled back environmental protections. His rebuttal commentary is simply a continuation of uninformed and misleading attacks on science and the health of Americans in the interest of industry. 
Within his commentary, Mr. Wheeler touts his former work as the head of the EPA in “protecting Americans from toxic exposures” but fails to mention his current connection to Perpetua Resources. In 2024 Mr. Wheeler joined the west coast law firm, Holland and Hart as an expert in regulatory affairs. Holland and Hart currently represents Perpetua Resources and their proposed mine in no less than four environmental permit appeals including three brought by ICL and our partners. 
One involves a Clean Water Act permit under Idaho DEQ administrative appeal (Agency case number. 0102-24-02), one involves the U.S. Forest Service’s Record of Decision in federal court (see case number 1:25-cv-00086-AKB), one involves the same air permit referenced in Mr. Wheeler’s and Dr. von Lindern’s commentary that is now being appealed within state court (see case number CV01-25-13306). The fourth major litigation is an appeal of the same U.S. Forest Service Record of Decision by the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho in federal court (see case number 3:25-cv-00498-AKB). 
With four active legal cases, it’s fair to question if Mr. Wheeler is acting on behalf of the public, Holland and Hart or Perpetua Resources. 
While Perpetua Resources has recently announced it has started on initial construction of its mine, it’s important to note that the above permit appeals present serious unsettled questions regarding the environmental impact of the mine. Until these appeals are concluded, the outcome of the mine is far from certain.
As Dr. von Lindern and I both testified during the administrative hearing process, the special concessions that Idaho DEQ granted to Perpetua have never been provided to any other Idaho air quality permit. They create a precedent that represents legitimate threats to air quality and human health for all Idahoans moving forward. 
There is no dispute that Idaho DEQ’s Stibnite Project Specific Adjustment factor increases cancer risk to any children exposed to arsenic from operations at the Stibnite Gold Project, the question is whether that insult will “average out” over the remainder of the child’s life. Whether Idaho DEQ violated state rules in issuing Perpetua Resources this air pollution permit will now be determined in state court, a venue where personal interest and hypocrisy can be shed from “truth.”

(Emma Davis/Maine Morning Star)Flags will be flying at half-staff across Maine Saturday in remembrance of the victims of the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston. 
Saturday marks two years since the state’s deadliest mass shooting at Just-In-Time Recreation and Schemengees Bar and Grille that killed 18 people and injured 13 others. 
“Although nothing can lessen their loss, we grieve with the families of the victims and the survivors of the Lewiston tragedy so that no one feels alone,” said Gov. Janet Mills. “We open our hearts to those who were injured and to those who are still struggling with the aftermath of that night. And we offer unending gratitude to the people whose heroic actions saved lives and set us on the long and winding road to healing.”
There are several events planned in Lewiston to mark the anniversary.
On Friday, community members gathered on Longley Bridge, where many held homemade signs on posters that said, “We Remember.”
“By leaning on our collective love for Lewiston, we will build a safer, more connected, and resilient future,” said Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline in a statement.
On Saturday afternoon, the Yes on Question 2 campaign, which is backing a statewide ballot initiative to adopt a red flag law, is hosting an interfaith event at 3 p.m. at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Lewiston. 
In addition to faith community leaders, Arthur Barnard, the father of Lewiston victim Artie Strout, and Joe Anderson, a doctor who worked in the emergency room the night of the shooting, will speak at the event. 
In early September, survivors and victims’ family members filed a lawsuit against the United States for negligence in failing to respond to warning signs and an explicit threat to commit a mass shooting. The lawsuit points to many of the findings of state and Army investigations, which concluded multi-agency failures related to the handling of perpetrator Robert Card II’s deteriorating mental health in the months leading up to the shooting.

(Zhang Mingming/VCG via Getty Images)The high-profile heist at the Louvre in Paris on Oct 19, 2025, played out like a scene from a Hollywood movie: a gang of thieves steal an assortment of dazzling royal jewels on display at one of the world’s most famous museums.
But with the authorities hot in pursuit, the robbers still have more work to do: How can they capitalize on their haul?
Most stolen works are never found. In the art crime courses I teach, I often point out that the recovery rate is below 10%. This is particularly disturbing when you consider that between 50,000 and 100,000 artworks are stolen each year globally — the actual number may be higher due to underreporting — with the majority stolen from Europe.
That said, it’s quite difficult to actually make money off stolen works of art. Yet the types of objects stolen from the Louvre — eight pieces of priceless jewelry — could give these thieves an upper hand.
At 9:30 a.m. local time on Oct. 19, 2025, four thieves reportedly used a lift mounted on a vehicle to enter the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery. (Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images)
 
A narrow market of buyers
Pilfered paintings can’t be sold on the art market because thieves can’t convey what’s known as “good title,” the ownership rights that belong to a legal owner. Furthermore, no reputable auction house or dealer would knowingly sell stolen art, nor would responsible collectors purchase stolen property.
But that doesn’t mean stolen paintings don’t have value.
In 2002, thieves broke into Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum through the roof and departed with “View of the Sea at Scheveningen” and “Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen” in tow. In 2016, Italian police recovered the relatively unscathed artworks from a Mafia safehouse in Naples. It isn’t clear whether the Mafia actually purchased the works, but it’s common for criminal syndicates to hold onto valuable assets as collateral of some sort.
Other times, stolen works do unwittingly end up in the hands of collectors.
In the 1960s in New York City, an employee of the Guggenheim Museum stole a Marc Chagall painting from storage. But the crime wasn’t even discovered until an inventory was taken years later. Unable to locate the work, the museum simply removed it from its records.
In the meantime, collectors Jules and Rachel Lubell bought the piece for US$17,000 from a gallery. When the couple requested that an auction house review the work for an estimate, a former Guggenheim employee at Sotheby’s recognized it as the missing painting.
Guggenheim demanded that the painting be returned, and a contentious court battle ensued. In the end, the parties settled the case, and the painting was returned to the museum after an undisclosed sum was paid to the collectors.
Some people do knowingly buy stolen art. After World War II, stolen works circulated on the market, with buyers fully aware of the widespread plunder that had just taken place across Europe.
Eventually, international laws were developed that gave the original owners the opportunity to recover looted property, even decades after the fact. In the U.S., for example, the law even allows descendants of the original owners to regain ownership of stolen works, provided they can offer enough evidence to prove their claims.
 
Jewels and gold easier to monetize
The Louvre theft didn’t involve paintings, though. The thieves came away with bejeweled property: a sapphire diadem; a necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an opulent matching set of earrings and a necklace that belonged to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a diamond brooch; and Empress Eugénie’s diadem and her corsage-bow brooch.
These centuries-old, exquisitely crafted works have unique historic and cultural value. But even if each one were broken to bits and sold for parts, they would still be worth a lot of money. Thieves can peddle the precious gemstones and metals to unscrupulous dealers and jewelers, who could reshape and sell them. Even at a fraction of their value — the price received for looted art is always far lower than that received for legitimately sourced art — the gems are worth millions of dollars.

While difficult to sell stolen goods on the legitimate market, there is an underground market for looted artworks. The pieces may be sold in backrooms, in private meetings or even on the dark web, where participants cannot be identified. Studies have also revealed that stolen — and sometimes forged — art and antiquities often appear on mainstream e-commerce sites like Facebook and eBay. After making a sale, the vendor may delete his or her online store and disappear.
 
A heist’s sensational allure
While films like “The Thomas Crown Affair” feature dramatic heists pulled off by impossibly attractive bandits, most art crimes are far more mundane.
Art theft is usually a crime of opportunity, and it tends to take place not in the heavily guarded halls of cultural institutions, but in storage units or while works are in transit.
Most large museums and cultural institutions do not display all the objects within their care. Instead, they sit in storage. Less than 10% of the Louvre’s collection is ever on display at one time — only about 35,000 of the museum’s 600,000 objects. The rest can remain unseen for years, even decades.
Works in storage can be unintentionally misplaced — like Andy Warhol’s rare silkscreen “Princess Beatrix,” which was likely accidentally discarded, along with 45 other works, during the renovation of a Dutch town hall — or simply pilfered by employees. According to the FBI, about 90% of museum heists are inside jobs.
In fact, days before the Louvre crime, a Picasso work valued at $650,000, “Still Life with Guitar,” went missing during its journey from Madrid to Granada. The painting was part of a shipment including other works by the Spanish master, but when the shipping packages were opened, the piece was missing. The incident received much less public attention.
To me, the biggest mistake the thieves made wasn’t abandoning the crown they dropped or the vest they discarded, essentially leaving clues for the authorities.
Rather, it was the brazen nature of the heist itself — one that captured the world’s attention, all but ensuring that French detectives, independent sleuths and international law enforcement will be on the lookout for new pieces of gold, gems and royal bling being offered up for sale in the years to come.
